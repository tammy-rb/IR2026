date so that we retain our competitive edge in this vital sector the hon lady will know that there have be global slowdown in the video game industry as whole that be one of the reason why we have

the video game industry be part of wide ecosystem that need support and we be determined to provide the full support we can so that our industry can thrive television industry wales what step her department be take to support the television industry in wales be glad to say that we have thriving tv industry in wales we have not only our own broadcaster but phenomenal studio include dragon studios just outside my constituency where willow be produce with the magnificent warwick davis and above all we have gavin and stacey know that it be completely out of order mr speaker but can say thank you to dawn in the tea room who be retire today diolch mr llefarydd only of my constituency of caerfyrddin have gigabit availability compare with the uk average of in fact of my constituency have very little broadband at all while more and more people use on demand and internet base tv service many still have to rely on terrestrial tv to watch their favourite welsh programme will the minister support the tv industry in wales and reassure viewer in my constituency that broadcast tv will remain available for they all to enjoy the series will be over think it be three part series mr speaker commend the hon lady on manage to get gigabit capable broadband which be my other responsibility as department for science innovation and technology minister into this session we be determined to try to make sure that across her constituency everybody be able to take part in the digital future incidentally that be why we publish digital inclusion strategy yesterday which very much hope all member will support electronic travel authorisations tourism what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of the cost of electronic travel authorisation on inbound tourism we be absolutely determined to reach our goal of million international visitor to the uk by be very hopeful that the electronic travel authorisation system will be simple and make it easy and safe for people to visit the uk in the come year our travel tourism and hospitality sector continue to face huge challenge yet the home office own impact assessment of the increase in electronic travel authorisation fee conclude that it could reduce the number of tourist want to come here and result in loss of revenue to the wide economy of million over five year if the government be to succeed in achieve the inbound tourism target of million by would an agreement between the eu and the uk to facilitate easy travel not be good place to start be absolutely delighted that even the liberal democrats be cite our target of million international visitor by we have get that into this session three time now the hon lady be right of course we have to bear in mind all the issue that could affect those number do not know whether she have see the recent video produce by visitbritain star great britain which include film clip from james bond tom cruise and many other but we be determined

to visitbritain the estimate value of inbound tourism in will be in the region of billion so it be huge economic contributor to the united kingdom when speak to tourism business that rely on seasonal tourism alongside the rise cost of etas they express great concern that the reduction in national insurance threshold and the rise in employer national insurance contribution mean that many more worker will be catch in damaging tax trap it will mean that business have to reconsider how many people many of they young and many of they in their first job they can employ while remain profitable do the minister have an impact assessment of the effect of those ni rise and what do it say about how many job will be create or lose as result of labour job tax trap one of the problem with the conservatives be that they want we to endlessly spend more money on thing but they do not want to find the money that enable we to afford that expenditure there be lot of thing that affect the tourism industry in the uk incidentally think the hon gentleman mistake his million for his billion in what he say but it be really important that we look at how we can extend the season in the uk and make sure that more international visitor do not just come to london and the south east but go to place across the whole of the united kingdom that be precisely the kind of thing that hope we will be able to incorporate into our national tourism strategy this autumn it will be the first time that the uk have ever have one football clubs financial sustainability what step she be take to help improve the

union we appreciate that there be serious challenge in this area and we be determined to grip they be sorry that be all that we can get in suggest that member get on to the government because really think that with so many people want to contribute we need an hour for these question church commissioners the hon member for battersea represent the church commissioners be ask rural parishes what assessment the church of england have make of the contribution of rural parish the church of england have more than church in our town and village in rural area in addition to their regular process of prayer and worship parish church play an important role in the life of our rural community in my constituency of bridlington and the wolds rural parish face huge financial pressure to maintain their historic church building their cost often run into ten of thousand yet they receive no funding from the church of england or the government the church of england building comprise more than of the country list building but all the money need to maintain they have to be raise locally this maintenance will soon be beyond the ability of our local church in rural area so will the hon lady make representation to the church of england to ensure that there be more financial support for local church so that we save this wonderful part of our heritage congratulate the hon member on be true champion for his constituency and also for the need for additional resource that will ensure that our church can truly stand the test of time shall certainly raise these issue and write to he about what step he can take at local level it be also worth point out that represent rural community and diocese bishop do meet regularly on quarterly basis to look at good practice and other way that they can support their diocese well list place of worship grant scheme what discussion the church have have with the government on the extension of the list place of worship grant scheme what assessment the church have make of the potential implication for its policy of the level of funding available from the list place of worship grant scheme in as set out in church commissioner question in january the list place of worship scheme be an effective way to deliver transformational benefit to local community the government extension of the scheme be very welcome but there be number of unanswered question about the impact of the change to the scheme the extension of the scheme will be welcome news to those involve with church such as st botolph in aspley guise in mid bedfordshire people there have tell of their concern about the lack of certainty for long term project that may need support beyond month will the church commissioner join and other colleague in press the chancellor to provide long term funding certainty the hon member have raise this issue at church commissioner question previously and he be right to continue to do so although the scheme be be extend until march we do not have long term plan or solution it be only right that the government should set out their plan we know that in large scale project cost over not all the vat can be return it be important that the department for culture media and sport come up with solution to ensure that the list place of worship scheme can continue holy trinity church in sunningdale have serve the parish for year it want to build on that legacy with community hub complete with new facility include volunteer run café for the wide community the cap on vat relief may be enough to sustain small project but this one will cost well over million that mean that another in donation will be need which can not stretch that far understand that the government be encourage church to apply for lottery funding but jon hutchinson have raise the fact that the scope of that funding be too narrow to cover the project will the second church estates commissioner meet to discuss how we can get this project over the line the hon member make an important point and raise an issue that affect many church the cap work for small project but it will not go far enough for large project such as the one in his constituency the church that attend holy trinity in clapham be experience similar challenge be happy to meet he the capping of the list place of worship grant scheme have leave many church in physical ruin such as the belfrey in york which will lose million even though it have do everything that be expect of it clearly we need to find solution and the suggestion from government have be insufficient will my hon friend ensure that the church commissioners co ordinate meeting of all church that be mid project to ensure that they can complete the work that they have undertake will take my hon friend question back to see if we can set up meeting as she highlight many church will be miss out on vital fund to carry out necessary repair particularly those that have already start work if that work extend beyond the march deadline they will not be able to reclaim any vat it be important that we find long term solution will be happy to take that forward house of commons commission the hon member for blaenau gwent and rhymney represent the house of commons commission be ask portcullis house what step the commission be take to ensure that portcullis house be function effectively official be work to ensure that

week that tragic day and the conflict that follow have have real life impact on community across the uk play out on our street and overseas and every one of we have duty to take the utmost care not to exacerbate the situation that be why have discuss editorial guideline with the bbc director general in recent day the bbc have clear editorial guideline to report hamas as terror organisation proscribe by the uk government that be its policy under the last government and that remain its policy now hold discussion with the bbc director general early this week at my request in order to seek urgent answer about the check and due diligence that should have be carry out ahead of the screening of recent documentary on gaza and about the commissioning the payment and the use of licence fee payer money also seek cast iron assurance that no money pay have fall into the hand of hamas and that the utmost care be take to ensure that that be the case expect to be keep inform about the finding of the internal bbc investigation and will be happy to update the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew and colleague across the house on its progress across all the issue on which the bbc may report the bbc operational and editorial independence from the government be an important principle that we intend to uphold as former minister at the department for culture media and sport the right hon member will be aware that it be for ofcom as the independent regulator to ensure the bbc fulfil its obligation under the charter and broadcast code nevertheless as have set out publicly it be essential that the bbc maintain the high standard of reporting and governance as the public rightly expect have make those view clear to the bbc that be crucial to ensure that the bbc retain the confidence of the public be grateful to the secretary of state for that answer the documentary gaza how to survive warzone be broadcast by the bbc on february it purport to show what everyday life be like for people in gaza topic of huge sensitivity as the uk public broadcaster the bbc have duty to provide accurate and impartial news and information which be particularly important when it come to coverage of highly sensitive event in this case it be clear that the bbc have fall far short of those standard shortly after it air report emerge that the documentary be narrate by the son of senior hamas figure initially the bbc defend the programme as an invaluable testament to the conflict and keep it available on iplayer only after significant public backlash do the bbc decide to withdraw it then we learn that on at least five occasion the word yahud and for jew and change to israel and israeli force or be remove from the documentary and then we learn that up to in public fund might have indirectly support terrorist organisation however regret to say that the government response to these allegation have be just as concern on monday the secretary of state refuse to say whether hamas proscribe terrorist organisation should be describe as such by the bbc but be glad to hear her comment today on tuesday the home secretary the minister responsible for address threat relate to terrorism say that she do not know the detail surround this case despite allegation that in public fund may have indirectly support this organisation for that reason the leader of the opposition write to the director general of the bbc request full independent inquiry to consider this and wide allegation of systemic bias against israel be grateful to the secretary of state for her response to my correspondence on this matter understand from her letter that she have raise these concern about the documentary with the director general and she have just confirm that and it be right that she do so but must press she far on the letter content do she make it clear that in this case the bbc have fall far short of the standard expect of the uk public broadcaster do she receive any assurance from the bbc that taxpayer money have not be funnel to hamas do she support our call for full independent inquiry into the documentary what commitment do she receive from the bbc that this will never happen again and if criminal investigation have to take place what will happen order that should have be two minute please will everyone measure how long they have it be unfair because we have lot of business to get through thank the right hon gentleman for bring this matter to the house and also for raise it with as he know have long history of take antisemitism extremely seriously for instance when it poison my own party and will always speak out without fear or favour when see it raise its ugly head be however deeply disappointed by his attempt to pretend that the government have be anything other than robust on this he will know that in the medium interview to which he refer make it crystal clear that the uk government and believe and have believe for long time that hamas be not only proscribe terrorist organisation in the uk but terrorist organisation and we will continue to describe it as such he will also know that in one of those interview make it clear that have request meeting with the director general of the bbc to discuss the matter of course the bbc be not there as an instrument of government minister seek to interfere with editorial decision or the day to day run of the organisation would be in nobody interest in seek to build the trust that be so fundamental to its core purpose official report february vol those be not my word but the word of the last medium minister the hon member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez whom the right hon gentleman serve alongside he be minister in that government the hon lady be now the parliamentary private secretary to the leader of the opposition if he disagree with she suggest that he take that up with she but this be far too important an issue to be treat as political football along with several other member visit israel and the occupy west bank last week but there be no access to gaza for we in fact the close we get to it be view the utter devastation of gaza city through telescope over the last year during the war accord to the committee to protect journalists at least palestinian journalist have be kill in gaza and the bbc and other journalist have have no access to gaza whatsoever do the secretary of state agree that that be as unacceptable as any attack on the independence of the bbc yes the duty to report on what be happen to people in gaza be absolutely fundamental and my right hon friend the foreign secretary have raise the issue of journalist access and protection and safety number of time that be why the government believe that the bbc and other have the utmost duty to exercise care and due diligence in the way in which they report on this conflict it be in no one interest for the public not to have confidence in the information that they be receive call the liberal democrat spokesperson commend the secretary of state for her response to the urgent question we agree with the position be take can not imagine what it must be like to be palestinian child in gaza in the first six month of the war alone of the child population be kill or injure and ten of thousand more will have be orphan or leave homeless give this humanitarian catastrophe many in this house today will find it deeply disappointing that due to error make in the production of this documentary we be instead discuss why it be pull rather than the press matter at hand many of we will share the regret that we have end up in this situation clearly innocent palestinian child have suffer terribly over the past month do the secretary of state agree that regardless of today discussion it be vital to shine an ongoing credible and sustain spotlight on the plight of child in gaza yes and thank the hon gentleman for his careful and consider word on this in the last year meet with the british family of some of the child in gaza and the story be absolutely horrifying we have duty to ensure that those story be tell and that people can have confidence in what they be be tell thank the secretary of state for get to grip with this issue so quickly and acknowledge that what happen on october and what happen subsequently in gaza be of huge significance her understanding give hope will she commit to come back to this chamber and update we on the outcome of whatever happen with the bbc investigation be happy to say to my hon friend who have long stand interest and have be real champion for child in gaza for many year that will be more than happy to keep colleague update as this progress and to update the whole house at the early opportunity call the chair of the culture media and sport committee the bbc have definitely get question to answer here not just on the dealing over this film but on the wide concern about the representation and reporting of the gaza conflict as the secretary of state say hamas be proscribe terrorist organisation yet they be refer to as such in just of instance of report by the bbc it take four day after broadcast for this programme to be take off iplayer and at that point the bbc say there have to be far due diligence with the production company it be not the first time that the bbc have have issue with its due diligence but in subject matter as sensitive and incendiary as this language matter and treat issue like this with detail sensitivity and impartiality matter especially the bbc board be meet today how confident be the secretary of state that the board be provide the necessary challenge to executive to maintain that due diligence and to maintain the trust in the organisation the hon lady be absolutely right that the bbc board play the critical role in ensure that the bbc reach the high possible standard which she and and indeed all member of this house expect they will have hear her word and mine loud and clear we expect they to play that role they must do that and part of my job be to hold they to account for what they do and do not do in relation to this welcome this statement because think it be important that we talk about our tone in public life worry that sometimes the public outside the chamber do not see this house as be the good arbiter of appropriate tone in fact in recent day have hear joke about suicide have see sexism and so much more do the secretary of state agree that we should lead from the front and set good example in this house on how we police our own boundary and language my hon friend as always have take care to strike the right tone and thank he very much for raise that interruption order the question be not relevant to what we be discuss that be the problem listen carefully to what the secretary of state say and welcome her clear criticism of this documentary but may return to some of the at good mistranslation that happen during the documentary that my right hon friend the shadow secretary of state reference instance of the arabic word for jews be change to israeli and possibly bad of all one interviewee praise the hamas leader for his jihad against the jews yet the bbc translate that to fight israeli force that be not an error in google translate it be clearly deliberate attempt to completely misinterpret the approach towards hamas and the situation in the middle east can she give an assurance that she will be robust in challenge those translation because those term be clearly antisemitic and take pro hamas pro terrorist viewpoint be more than happy to give the hon gentleman that assurance discuss the precise use of language with the bbc director general early this week on the question ask by the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage also discuss the use of the full term proscribe terror organisation by the uk government and the frequency with which that term be use by the bbc make it clear that as the secretary of state believe that it be incredibly important that the bbc adhere to its own guideline hamas be proscribe organisation and that be as it should be the israeli military have ban international journalist from gaza and at least palestinian journalist have be kill in gaza in the last day do the secretary of state agree that bbc and all medium coverage of gaza can only benefit from journalist be allow in to report on the ground point raise with by some constituent in the past few week do she far agree that journalist must be protect from harm in line with international law pay tribute to my hon friend for the work that she have do over many year include as the director of medical aid for palestinians she know well than anyone in this house what be happen in gaza think she may be the only member of the house who have recently be in gaza to see the condition that many hon member have describe very much agree with her point about journalistic access and safety also agree with my hon friend the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn that we set the right tone in this house be essential be sure that member across the house all agree that the most important issue be the maintenance of the ceasefire hostage need to go home aid need to get in and peaceful future need to be build what more can this government do to ensure that the story of those affect be hear to continue the international determination for the maintenance of the ceasefire when meet british palestinians whose family member be in gaza and when meet the family whose love one have be take hostage by hamas and have be hold or continue to be hold in gaza make commitment to they that in opposition and in government we would continue to use every opportunity to shine spotlight on what be happen to they think they will be very encourage by the word of the hon lady it be particular to tribute to the house that members from every political party be raise these issue and ensure that we continue to tell those story since the hamas atrocity of october ten of thousand of gazans have be kill by israeli force and hundred of thousand more have be subject to unimaginable suffering it be essential that their story be tell and it be unacceptable that the bbc should have choose to tell they through those connect to hamas we understand that the bbc be not allow into gaza so will the secretary of state confirm where this programme be subcontract and to whom on the issue of translation do the bbc not have translation guide be that publicly available if not should it be finally when israeli ministers and other call for the ethnic cleansing of gaza or for the elimination of the palestinian people surely that must be report in way that highlight that that be illegal and the cause of immense distress to many in this country my hon friend speak powerfully about the careful use of language and the way in which we all have responsibility to uphold the high standard on that on her specific question have have discussion with the bbc can confirm that this be not bbc programme it be commission by an external report march vol correction that in no way absolve the bbc from the responsibility to undertake due diligence on programme that it air when it be air by our national broadcaster it be grant the legitimacy of our national broadcaster and that be why these standard matter will take away her suggestion about publicly available translation guide which might help to assuage some of the concern raise by the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith and discuss that with the bbc it be essential that the editorial independence of the bbc be protect at home and abroad will the secretary of state tell the house whether she or anyone in her department have contact formally or informally with the israeli embassy about the documentary before it be pull from iplayer and will she say when contact be first make between she and the bbc between the programme be air and then be pull from iplayer no thank the secretary of state for her very clear statement the big picture that the opposition be miss here be that the british medium at large have greatly suffer from lack of access in gaza during the deadly war on record for journalist my former colleague have variously be deny entry and have unnecessarily prolong and risky exit and our palestinian contributor have be stick in living nightmare will the secretary of state ensure that she continue to safeguard british medium interest and their reporting abroad and work with foreign office colleague to enlarge access for journalist in gaza be very happy to give my hon friend that assurance as say in answer to an early question my right hon friend the foreign secretary have raise this issue and he and be work very closely together on it my hon friend will be aware that the bbc world service play critical role in ensure that free and fair information be available all over the world which be why we rightly expect the high standard from the bbc welcome the secretary of state robust view on the bbc however the problem be that the bbc do not refer to hamas as terrorist organisation as it should indeed the problem be that david collier an investigative journalist could actually go through the documentary and identify all the error that be make while sit at his computer if the bbc can not do that something be seriously wrong particularly when it be in the position of commission this documentary not do it internally can the secretary of state make sure that when she talk to the bbc it make extra effort to ensure that if it commission these sort of documentary they be actually accurate and not use terrorist and potentially funnel money to terrorist be happy to give the hon gentleman that assurance that be part of the discussion have with the bbc director general early this week would expect an organisation like the bbc already to have robust system in place on that and have be assure that that be part of the internal review do the secretary of state agree that across all the issue that the bbc may report on its operational and editorial independence from government be an important principle that should be uphold yes very much agree with my hon friend not least because it be the role of broadcaster to hold mirror up not just to society but to the government and to hold we to account that be why very much agree with the word of the medium minister in the previous government the hon member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez who say that the bbc be not an instrument of government minister seek to interfere with editorial decision or the day to day run of the organisation would be in nobody report february vol once again the bbc have get it badly wrong since october with its treatment and description of hamas as terrorist organisation once again we be tell that lesson will be learn do the secretary of state think that the bbc be incompetent negligent or just riddle with antisemitism have be absolutely clear with this house that think the bbc have serious question to answer the director general be very clear with early this week that it have serious question to answer and that it intend to answer they in full and will make sure that be the case it be quite clear that the bbc have not show the standard of journalistic integrity that we expect of it in the case of this documentary or through its coverage of the october attack and the war that follow danny cohen the former bbc director of television say that the bbc be institutionally hostile to israel can we have an inquiry into not only this incident but the bbc relationship with hamas the independence of its reporter in gaza from hamas and its wide coverage of israel if there be evidence of bbc fund reach proscribe terrorist organisation will the secretary of state join in say that there should be full criminal investigation ensure that no money have fall into the hand of hamas be the duty of all of we the last government be very clear about that in relation to the aid budget and we be very clear about that too the bbc need to be as clear or there must be consequence also reassure the hon gentleman that in december convene roundtable with the jewish community to discuss antisemitism in the art and the creative industry more generally be appal by what hear at that meeting which be convene by lord mann and the board of deputies of british jews we be work very closely together to stamp out the many unacceptable practice that we have see creep not just into the bbc but across broadcasting and the art more generally since this appalling conflict begin be grateful to the secretary of state for her answer to the urgent question we all agree that the genuine inaccuracy and misrepresentation in this documentary and in all reporting must be address and that step must be take to prevent they from reoccurre we also all agree that there be no place for antisemitism or any other racism anywhere the bbc have be accuse by more than of its staff of give israel favourable coverage in its reporting of the war on gaza and criticise for its lack of accurate evidence base journalism the letter send to the bbc director general and chief executive officer say basic journalistic tenet have be lack when it come to hold israel to account for its action its signatory include more than anonymous bbc staff and more than people from the media industry the letter also say the consequence of inadequate coverage be significant every television report article and radio interview that have fail to robustly challenge israeli claim have systematically dehumanise palestinians what step order we have get to get to the question please my apology mr speaker what step be the secretary of state take to investigate and address the unacceptable and biased anti palestinian and pro israel report by the bbc since october so that it can be trust by those in this house and by the licence fee payer who fund its existence the view that the hon gentleman have express show what contested and difficult area this be to report on while this government believe it be essential that we shine spotlight on what be happen to people particularly child in gaza there be no excuse for antisemitism or for the sort of practice that have be allege against the bbc in recent week in relation to this documentary welcome the secretary of state robust response from the dispatch box today and thank she for it this be an egregious example but the problem be the pattern of behaviour for example the bbc have spend of taxpayer money on legal fee to cover up the balen report into coverage of this conflict do the secretary of state agree that there be valid question as to why the bbc have refuse to submit to an independent inquiry do she agree that the finding of the balen report have be suppress and will the government urge the bbc to publish that report the hon gentleman be right that there be valid question to answer the bbc be treasured national broadcaster it play an important role in our public life and indeed in the whole ecosystem of the creative industry in this country that be why we be determined to hold it to the high possible standard and we expect that it will do nothing less itself thank the secretary of state for her statement we all agree that the bbc impartiality be imperative and that antisemitism be abhorrent but be it not enough that we have stand by as gazans have be kill include gazan child be it not enough that we have stand by as aid worker and journalist have be kill do the secretary of state agree that child and the narrator of this show specifically can not be hold accountable for the action of their parent or be this just an extension of netanyahu policy of collective punishment of the gazan people of course agree with the hon gentleman that child can not be hold responsible for relationship that they have but to be clear if the child in question be relate to senior hamas official that be important context for viewer to understand not to inform the public about that context fall way short of the standard we would expect of our national broadcaster can also say to the hon gentleman that we as country have not stand aside while over people have be kill in gaza my right hon friend the foreign secretary have make this his top priority he have be in the region several time in recent month and just few week ago my right hon friend the minister for development announce million in humanitarian funding for gaza to ensure that we support its people notwithstanding the very difficult decision that the prime minister announce at this dispatch box on tuesday we be committed to continue to support the people of gaza the day when people gain their news from the bbc and itv be long go we now have whole range of medium outlet many of which do not have the same editorial standard as we expect from our national broadcaster so do the secretary of state agree that it be vital that we can trust our national broadcaster and that it maintain the high possible standard the hon member make an important point which do not think anybody have make yet in this debate which be that we expect more from the bbc because it be our treasured national broadcaster there be media landscape out there and we have get to make sure that all our broadcaster meet the high standard especially when it come to this conflict thank the minister for her answer to the urgent question the bbc have publicly fund status and therefore have an obligation to report impartially but that have be call into question since the october atrocity will the minister act to hold the bbc cameraman and the staff accountable for their failing furthermore what measure will be introduce to ensure that the bbc editorial standard be raise to prevent the dissemination of mislead biased and unverified content the hon member will have hear that raise number of issue around this particular documentary and the reporting of this conflict more generally when meet the bbc director general expect the high possible standard hear from the director general that he expect the high possible standard as well and that the review will cover all the area that the hon member rightly raise business of the house call the shadow leader of the house thank you mr deputy

fill my head this morning but thank you again it be my happy task to open by say that today see the retirement of dawn stalwart of the tea room be sure that speak for the whole house in wish she very happy retirement on very different note this week also mark the third anniversary of russia invasion of ukraine we wish the prime minister every success in his meeting at the white house today the government have come in for some fairly punish criticism from at the dispatch box in recent month and rightly so they come to power loudly advertise their virtue and careful planning but instead as the house will know we have see series of entirely avoidable resignation blunder and mishap the government have talk about growth but their decision have manage to reduce the bank of england forecast from to growth for this year it be little wonder when one consider the billion increase in national insurance contribution and the imposition of an employment rights bill with an up front cost estimate at billion among much else most bizarre of all have be the lack of foresight in financial planning the chancellor talk grandly in her mais lecture last year about that is and the importance of economic security but as many commentator have notice her fiscal rule and other decision have leave she very little room for manoeuvre after all it be obvious in the autumn that there could be tariff on trade and as minister have since acknowledge an inevitable rise in defence spending it be almost as though labour never imagine or perhaps never want to believe that president trump would be re elect as result the government may be force to have mini budget next month and then spending review which have be so delay that they will have go full year from their election without have any settle spending plan meanwhile they prefer to import oil and gas from abroad rather than use less expensive domestic energy supply forget securonomic this be recipe for insecurity as well as increase carbon emission however it be important to give credit where credit be due report in december that genuine sign of reality be start to break through in the government so call plan for change in it the prime minister say in the incoming government inherit public finance in desperate need of repair he say that the uk need profound cultural shift away from declinist mentality which have become so comfortable with failure finally and most notably he say that we can not tax our way to prosperity or spend our way to well public service the prime minister be right on all three count and he be right now to increase defence spending it be not untrue to say that he be visibly become more conservative before our eye unfortunately the real number in the defence statement be in fact half what he claim as the institute for fiscal studies quickly make clear and be sorry to say that the statement be insult in other way to this house it appear to have be leak to the medium who run the headline before the prime minister have even stand up perish the thought that the statement be deliberately redact so that mps would be keep in the dark and could not hold the government to account the prime minister have emphasise all the planning that be involve in this decision even so he be repeatedly unable to answer the simple yes or no question of whether funding for the chagos islands deal be include in the total what be bad be that in his statement the prime minister try to aggregate the intelligence service budget into the defence budget that be grossly misleading because those budget be and have long be keep separate what be bad still be that the prime minister claim that the combination of the two budget would be of gdp seem to imply cut not rise in the budget for the intelligence service which currently stand at over of gdp this can not be correct even if the leader of the house can not address my question now would be grateful if she could write to with the detail in order to answer it for the record and for the benefit of this house may too welcome the retirement of dawn from the tea room and wish she well let also say that we have have an excellent couple of ten minute rule bills this week first from the shadow leader of the house who bring forward very important bill on clean up the river wye which know be of real importance to his constituent and then from my brilliant parliamentary private secretary my hon friend the member for west bromwich sarah coombes who introduce bill to crack down on ghost number plate on car which be very important issue they be in good company with each other this week as the prime minister attend very important meeting with president trump today know that he have the support of the whole house behind he in the national interest the peace and security that we have enjoy in recent generation have shift significantly in the last few year not least because of russia aggression and its illegal invasion of ukraine the prime minister have show determined leadership on the world stage to ensure that our national security be protect in the long term the whole house have also come together once again this week to show our unity and strength in support ukraine three year since russia full scale illegal invasion of ukraine we stand in solidarity with its people we support their bravery and their democratically elect president and we stand firm for their sovereignty and lasting security free from threat from russia the cross party unity on display this week which know will be on display again this afternoon show this house at its good and give the prime minister great strength in his negotiation and discussion as the shadow leader of the house say the prime minister also announce this week to parliament first that to respond to the change and grow threat we face defence spending will increase to of gdp by and grow to in the next parliament this mark the big sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war go far than commitment we make in our manifesto it be vital not just for our own capability but for maintain peace and security beyond our shore other european country must also step up at this crucial juncture be really pleased that the announcement of the increase to be universally welcome across the house the right hon gentleman yet again raise the government economic record let we have look at that record once again shall we interest rate have come down three time in row mortgage rate be also go down wage be go up and the lowest pay will receive big pay rise from april he may not be interested in pay and work as dignity and security but this party be and we be not ashamed to say so he talk about energy price and he will know that this country under his government be uniquely and specifically expose to global energy market the only way for we to get low bill in the long term sustainable low bill be to make sure that we have clean energy generate in this country and that be what this government be embark on unfortunately the right hon gentleman want to open up difference on defence spending but gently remind he that the last time we spend on defence be under the last labour government his government make promise after promise on the never never but it never happen and it be not credible plan so gently remind he of that it be another week of business question and another week that the shadow leader of the house have fail to say anything supportive about his own leader keep give he ample opportunity to do so at these session each week think he might want to highlight some of the recent speech and intervention she have make give that they have have so little coverage she advise we to stop hide behind vapid statement be not sure that we be make vapid statement think that may be she be he not take with her claim that only the conservative be the guardian of western civilisation know he take his history very seriously so what do he make of that claim do the right hon gentleman not want to take the opportunity to restate the claim that the prime minister big move this week be all down to letter he receive from the leader of the opposition or do he like the rest of we realise that that be obviously absurd what about her suggestion that her leadership stint be akin to that of donald trump in his second term mean come on think we can all see that it be not quite go the way the conservatives hop be not sure whether the right hon gentleman be card player but be sure he agree with that they be not really hold the trump card but more of bust flush unaccountable power carry significant risk as we have see in this place and across our public service but when it be in the nhs it can lead to the death of patient the complaint system in the nhs be not function they be defensive and they be not try to solve the issue can we have debate about nhs complaint to keep our constituent safe thank my hon friend for raise this important matter as constituency mp be sure we all recognise the point she have make have hear the health secretary speak about these issue many time and know he be commit to ensure that the nhs be accountable and responsive take complaint very seriously and do not in any way try to cover up or hide problem in the service call the liberal democrat spokesperson the climate change committee have publish advice in its seventh carbon budget that set out new pathway to decarbonisation include on how the uk can meet the legally binding target of net zero greenhouse gas emission by the climate change committee have already report that the uk be behind in meet its climate target and it have criticise the government decision to go ahead with the coalmine in cumbria and oil and gas field in the north sea on top of that ofgem have take the decision to increase the cap for the price of energy bill by in april which be high than the increase that even those in the sector expect this be the third increase since october the late price rise mean that household will be force to pay about year more for their gas and electricity than before russia invasion of ukraine three year ago the liberal democrats have be gravely concern about the government delay to tackle poorly insulate home over this winter and to implement the new future home standard as result an estimate million household be still in fuel poverty it be clear that to tackle the joint issue of climate change and ever increase energy price the government must be bold the liberal democrats want year emergency upgrade programme to make home warm and cheap to heat include free insulation and heat pump for those on low income will the leader of the house grant debate in government time to discuss what more can be do to support those struggle to stay warm in way that also support decarbonisation thank the hon lady for that important question and contribution know that she and her party take this issue as seriously as the government and welcome she raise it here today she be absolutely right that energy bill and the soar cost of energy over recent year be huge worry to people and be unaffordable for many that be why we have mission to become clean energy superpower by which will not only help to keep bill low for long but drive growth and tackle the climate crisis she will know be sure that this country be particularly and uniquely expose to global energy price and that be still affect the energy price cap this year be sure hon lady will agree that the only way to tackle the issue be to ensure that we have home grow cheap renewable power and that we reduce demand as she say by the well insulation of our home which account for huge amount of our energy use household energy price be low than they be last year but we need to go far and fast we announce an extension of the warm home discount scheme which mean an extra for nearly million additional people and we have commit billion over the next three year for home insulation we will continue to go far and fast and will ensure that she and the house be keep update recently burst thames water pipe leave thousand of my constituent

interest and those across the world the prime minister and foreign secretary be currently in the united states but hope we can have statement next week on the action the government will take to prevent iran from acquire nuclear weapon and to confirm that snapback arrangement will if necessary be put in place with the necessary implication of ensure that iran do not acquire nuclear weapon as it would destabilise the entirety of the middle east and beyond if it do thank the chair of the backbench business committee for announce number of debate that will be widely welcome many of those issue get raise with in these session so be glad his committee have accommodate they would say however that be sure you would be lot happy mr speaker with debate on rugby league rather than rugby

make mess of this issue it need to get grip get it sorted and get these roadwork clear so that the business and people in my hon friend constituency can get back to work understand that the home secretary be visit calais today hope that she will not only see the beach from which illegal immigrant depart for the united kingdom but visit the facility that see myself week ago today with michael keohan and jack valpy from bbc south east where we discover some migrant from sudan live in total squalor with no sanitation of any kind hope that the home secretary will have raise this matter with the mayor of calais with the député for calais and with her counterpart the interior minister of france appreciate that monday be likely to be busy day with the prime minister return from washington but will the leader of the house ask the home secretary to come to the house at the early opportunity to make statement on what she have find the right hon member be absolutely right the situation in relation to the small boat crossing continue to be intolerable in many regard this country can not sustain what we be see the situation in calais include the step that be be take or not be not acceptable either that be why we have bring forward the border security asylum and immigration bill and be work very closely with france not just on what be happen in calais but far upstream to ensure that those migrant do not arrive in calais and then on these shore in the first place the right hon member make very good point about ensure that the house be keep up to date know that the home secretary take that incredibly seriously and that she be very forthcoming on these matter none the less will certainly ensure that she have hear what he have say really enjoy have kick about with

happen at derby racecourse which be in her constituency and be keen to support she in that be not great player of football myself although think be pretty good tackler in some regard but agree that this would make very good topic for debate recently visit bath roman boxing gym anybody who want to see my amazing right hand swing can watch it on social medium more seriously in connection with the question that the leader of the house have just answer how can we support community organisation such as the roman boxing gym which provide incredible opportunity for young people to compete internationally and nationally and also provide important diversionary activity can we have debate in government time on all these activity that be so powerful in our community will take look at the hon lady leave hook or right hook however hand she be be sure she pack powerful punch she make really good point know from my own constituency how important boxing box club and sport activity be in general that be why this government be commit to curriculum review to ensure that school and organisation such as bath roman boxing gym be able to provide young people with these kind of opportunity it be also why we be give local government the big boost to funding that it have have in many year because many of these organisation rely on local government funding none the less she be absolutely right we need to do more to ensure that young people such as those in her constituency have the opportunity to access sport culture and other activity be sure that it would make good topic for debate when the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak be chancellor he say that he have divert public money away from deprived urban area in ilford south our local redbridge council have be rank among the most cost effective council in the country yet my neighbour be still suffer from the inequality of the politically motivated conservative funding formula will the leader of the house consider debate on local government funding formula to ensure that all area receive their fair share of funding to deliver for local people my hon friend be absolutely right the previous government do change the funding formula take funding away from some of the high need local authority in our country that be why we be look again at those funding formula why we will be do three year settlement for local government and why we have give local government the big funding boost that it have have for many year but we need to go far on these matter and it be important that we do so we regularly have debate on local government funding but will ensure that there be one come up call nick timothy thank you mr speaker that be pleasant surprise after my brief admonishment can spoil it if you want in suffolk we be move towards unitary council as part of local government reform put on record my discomfort that our local election which be due this year have be postpone the danger of the reform however be that power will be take far away from local resident want parish and town council to be empower to take responsibility for problem such as speeding and road safety can we have debate on how we empower town and village to get thing do directly for local resident although hear the hon gentleman worry about the election the delay be only by year so that in area such as his we do not hold unnecessary election this year ahead of mayoral election next year this be about devolve huge number of power to local area and those local area have to be of size to cope with those power know from my own area in manchester that ward by ward that be be feel the devolution revolution be have huge positive impact in my area and be sure that it will in his as well before the recess thank to the backbench business committee lead an excellent debate on coalfield community it be subject to time limit be immediately oversubscribe and have no time to wind up with that in mind will the leader of the house allow debate in government time for we to far unpick how we can secure the investment seize the opportunity and deliver the change that coalfield community such as mine in newcastle under lyme and those up and down our country desperately deserve my hon friend be right that coalfield community make huge contribution to this country this government have support they very quickly in number of way just in our first few month in office understand that his debate be oversubscribed and be sure that there would be great appetite for further debate so will consider carefully his question adhd assessment wait time be too long leave patient and family in limbo as they be leave without crucial treatment alongside exist medication shortage that undermine the right to choose not require improvement in local nhs provision of adhd assessment would be incredibly shortsighted will the leader of the house hold debate in government time on the crisis in adhd service and will she ask her colleague in the department of health and social care to write to to confirm that there will be no deterioration in waiting time in wokingham and across england thank the hon gentleman for raise this matter which be raise with regularly be sure that he will appreciate that we inherit broken system for adhd assessment there be currently unacceptable delay as he outline understand that

responsible for the site have be unacceptable despite repeat effort by shevington labour councillor mps and knowsley council can we have debate on tackle lack of enforcement for waste management plant be disappointed to hear that this awful matter be take so long to be resolve despite representation from my hon friend and her colleague she be absolutely right that the environment agency have the

year farming roadmap which the national farmers union have welcome as long overdue and we be take other step such as extend the seasonal worker visa route for five more year which have also be welcome

west yorkshire combine authority to make sure that those plan become reality backbench business war in ukraine third anniversary beg to move that this house have consider the third anniversary of the war in ukraine have be work on ukraine with many colleague in all part of the house for considerable time we have share that work the reality in this chamber which may mark we out slightly from other country be that we have be completely unite in our support for ukraine and the people of ukraine who be fight for their freedom as we have have to do in the past we therefore recognise their sacrifice and the risk that they have take to anybody who assume that that be of no relevance say that the only relevant issue that pervade this debate be that we should always be on the side of those who believe in freedom and democracy that be what we exist for recently come back from another trip to ukraine have do few trip there help by charity call hopefull what it have do be quite remarkable and be another example of how people in britain see thing sometimes slightly differently from the rest of the world when russia invade ukraine and there be serious danger of it take kyiv in those early week the charity which have be work in scotland in the area around dundee help to support people in difficulty and in poor circumstance upped stick and decide that its real cause be now to help those flee from the russians at the border of poland which it do in fact the charity turn up two week early than even oxfam manage simply by get truck and drive across that be very british way of do thing eventually the charity cross over the border and over the past three year it have supply many people organisation town and city with food the way in which it have do that be to take pizza in pizza truck to feed they indicate assent the hon gentleman be nod because he and be recently cook those pizza close to the front that charity have feed more than million ukrainians in that time use charitable money and support from other country which be quite remarkable the charity have now turn its attention to the other huge issue of combat stress and the disaster post war that will haunt ukrainians for those who will suffer internally and externally and will come to that in few minute be therefore proud that people from the charity be in the gallery today to watch the debate know that we should not normally refer to the gallery but in this instance it be quite relevant of its own accord the charity have launch rehabilitation programme in ukraine where it be try to set up treatment for those with serious combat stress and then try to multiply that out by teach other veteran to help people through programme all across ukraine we have lot to learn from ukraine on the scale of that and from what they be see at the moment and the figure be absolutely staggering that address the psychological and physical need and the moral injury which be huge on scale that we have not see since the second world war it be worth look at couple of piece on this subject apart from combat stress the scale of the damage be quite interesting there be million veteran in ukraine some of those veteran and young people now need prosthetic will repeat that ukrainians be wait to get prosthetic they have lose leg and arm through the mine the shell and the shellfire civilian have be treat just like soldier they have be attack by the russians who bombard hospital have be to hospital the military hospital in kharkiv which visit be shell regularly and deliberately who shell hospital deliberately they do on my last visit visit wonderful child hospital in kyiv think the hon member for macclesfield tim roca may have be with on that visit the child hospital have receive direct hit from ballistic missile we do not get misfire on ballistic missile they be target to within yard of their destination point that be deliberate and it try to blow apart the work that the hospital be do to help child suffer from cancer and all the ailment of war that be the real horror of how russia have fight this war the very fact that it fight the war and invade ukraine be bad enough but it have not stick to all the usual rule that apply to those who fight civilian should be leave out of it as far as possible but russia target they go to the prosthetic lab to see this and we in this country have lot to learn from the ukrainians they be make advance in prosthetic that we simply could not have believe be feasible say to the government that we really need to be send people over there to look at what they be do and bring it back because it could be apply to civilian injury in this country all of the work that the charity hopefull be do be aim at help those people and salute it for that there be those who say that ukraine be somehow guilty of cause the war have be to ukraine with other member and one need only see the sheer brutality of what have be happen on the ground to recognise how wrong such statement be russia aggression be not cause by anybody else it be cause by russia greed its avarice and its wrong head idea that it can recreate greater russia along the old soviet union line that be what be drive this war that be what have lead to probably over dead and injure russians whose family will never see they again many of course will never see their body because russia systematically cremate they so that there will not be series of funeral in russia which could cause problem at home that show the cynicism of the country we therefore need to remind everybody we do not think that we do that ukraine be fight war of defence not of aggression it be russia that have create the problem because of all the thing that have be go on and mill around in the air and all the row that have be take place also want to say that we need to take pace back this be not about point finger at anybody it be about try to correct some of what have be say have to say straight off that peace be not just the absence of war if it be just the absence of war it become ceasefire an intolerable ceasefire that will break down for peace to be durable and long last we need it to contain freedom and justice there can be no real peace without justice for those who have be fight for their country and for peace that have to apply to we in nato in america and in europe we need to recognise that there can be no peace unless there be justice in that peace for those who have suffer most my right hon friend be make powerful speech factually the article mutual defence clause of the washington treaty have only ever be invoke once in its history that be by the united states after when president bush rule that america have be attack and nato in europe particularly britain come to its aid do my right hon friend think it be worth bear that in mind as these very important discussion take place in washington of course it be article have be the reason that western europe have be able to grow and settle and america have also be able to pursue its own end because of the mutual defence pact that exist between we remember that sir tony blair who be the prime minister at that stage do not waste any time he come out immediately to support america so much so that he be able to get into the debate that take place in the congress and be welcome as friend which be quite right the reality be that the uk be the first to push for article to be invoke and george robertson be the head of nato at the time and move it for the first time that be very much the right thing to do and that be what underpin this before continue want to come back to some of the after effect go to see those who be look after and be responsible for prisoner of war in kyiv what be fascinating be that the abuse that be take place in russia trash the geneva convention on support for prisoner of war russia spend its time move ukrainian prisoner of war around and do not allow the red cross full access at any stage that be against the convention and the red cross have complain although do not think it have say it loudly enough that some ukrainian prisoner of war be be use as human shield some be be use to clear mine in certain area which be also against the rule we also know that in number of case after serious interrogation of those prisoner of war which be also illegal their family in ukraine be be bully and threaten they be tell that unless they start spy or carry out damaging act in ukraine their love one their husband son or daughter in the prisoner of war camp if such thing exist will be torture and deal with this be go on quite regularly now and have be discover by the ukrainians it be illegal under the geneva convention and urge the government to speak seriously to the red cross about make much more public statement about how prisoner of war be be treat because it really be quite shocking there be lack of accountability on this and the red cross need to do much more we must not underestimate the fact that there have be change of regime in the united states and that president trump have make it very clear that he want the war to end and that we have to drive to that think all of we in this house would support that position we want to see an end to war in fact the ukrainians want to see an end to war nobody want to carry on fight if there be possibility of good peace deal that as have say contain justice and freedom for the ukrainians however president trump see this as sideshow he say that he be more focused on china taiwan and other issue and think he want to make saving on the united states spending in some of these area which be reasonable however the problem be that for all our support for ukraine the reason why this war have go on for three year be that we the ally quite honestly have drag our foot on supply the weapon and equipment that ukraine need from day one in fact there be period in when russia be on the rack and have real problem it be short of munition it have lose territory to the ukrainians certainly in the east around kharkiv and that be the moment at which ukraine might well have be able to deal properly with russia and push it back strangely enough at that stage two thing seem to have happen first do not believe that the attack on israel by hamas be just stand alone item think that iran china and other have realise that russia need distraction the americans of course immediately move to support israel which be what they will do and supply arm to the israelis be in the congress around that time look to see whether america could get the money through some of the republicans do not agree with the bill and be block it we do manage to persuade few and they do push it forward but my point be that they say the war in israel be our war ukraine be your war not ours and we be keenly concerned about taiwan the point make to those republicans which make again now be that in reality we can not separate taiwan from ukraine or in way from israel my personal view be that china hand be in all of this and that distraction that move of equipment have mean that russia have be able to regain its strength and reach rapprochement with north korea interestingly enough the scale of weapon that north korea be now supply be breathtake think that well over million artillery shell have be supply since it sign the agreement with russia it now have thousand of troop in russia who be defend the russian position and it be plan to supply even more weapon and missile this be chain of totalitarian state that be work to support each other and we be lose on this because we ourselves do not focus on that linkage between iran russia china and north korea give one small warning it be something the americans need to face and hope that the government will raise it with they it be simply this russia in reply be give significant technology to the north koreans particularly for submarine launch ballistic missile the security service here know about that but it be serious and significant shift if the north koreans have that technology they will be able to take their nuclear weapon out to sea which will bring all the american continent directly under target from those missile that will change the whole nature of the pacific in term of how we see geostrategic defence it be major change and russia have be give the north koreans that technology it would be useful for the government to say that this matter be not separable ukraine be the reason for that move the road to taiwan run right through ukraine and we can not and must not separate they make the simple point that when we speak about the money it be huge amount know that the chair of the select committee the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne will want to speak on this but the reality be that we have have debate before on the huge amount of money we have sit here those be asset belong to russians not just the oligarchs but also the state some billion of russian asset be freeze within the and the eu some billion of central bank of russia reserve be freeze in the uk alone that be manage by euroclear and there be euroclear money in canada and other country the government say the other day that they be prepared to use the money earn from that capital for ukraine argue that if they be to use the money earn from the capital they also have right to use the capital we should not just freeze the capital sit in the bank but seize it and use it for reparation damage repair and the work that be necessary think we would see major change immediately can the right hon member explain why there seem to be certain reluctance among western leader to use this capital the billion or so of russian state asset in western bank it could be powerful as part of potential peace negotiation agree can understand that reluctance think it be twofold those who have financial service market be worried that if they leap out and do this without full agreement all those other country will say that be the last time we will ever invest money in that capital market we will move it to the other country that do not do that can understand from the government standpoint that it have to be agree across at least the as its member control most of those capital market that would mean there would not be any country for an oligarch or totalitarian leader to go to we have have long time to get this right canada have make the strong statement of all be tell that america be okay under the last administration be not sure now but would hope that president trump realise this money be there we should make this agreement as fast as possible there can be no peace deal without money attach to it and that money be necessary for ukraine and must be use for ukraine and it be huge sum if we think we can use the earning from the capital we can use the capital too because there be no definition or delineation between they if we own the earning we own the capital the right hon gentleman and have organise debate on this topic in the past do he share my view that we now need to get lot fast in seize this money not only to pay for the munition need to win the war but crucially then to win the peace in ukraine make good the horrific scale of damage that russia have inflict on that great country can not put piece of paper between the two of we the right hon gentleman be absolutely right he now have the capability to push the government over this issue through his select committee whatever he choose to do assure he that opposition members will support he in that pursuit we need to get these decision make now because that will put pressure on russia if we make the decision to seize this money russia will then be under pressure to reach reasonable agreement because the russians do not want to lose all this money in the meantime there be whole line of pressure that we should be bring to bear on the russians we have allow certain thing to take place and do not blame just this government because it also happen under the last government the foreign office be always slightly reluctant to pursue sanction with quite the aggressive nature that would want we recognise that everything have always get to be well minister you know we must take into consideration huge number of factor here such as why when and who these need paper minister would say to they forget the paper let get to the fact the fact be that we have be allow shadow fleet carry liquefy natural gas to come from russia even in the past few month and deliver to the uk and other country how can it do that the answer be simple and have raise this with the government previously the americans have step in and say that any country that take this gas will be sanction and that stop it overnight but we could have stop it because we have the major marine insurer in this country it be british company that be insure this shadow fleet to take russian gas elsewhere in what world do people sit there watch that and string out question about what they should do all we have to do be to say that we would sanction any marine insurer that insure one of those vessel that would have be the end of it because the marine insurer market be here in the uk it would have kill that practice stone dead america have now move on this and we can see some of these ship anchor off such place as india and even china because they dare not take the gas because of the sanction urge the government to drive their civil servant to be quick fast and more determined to follow the money and to stop it as say that be not criticism alone of the present government it be also criticism of the government of my party that be in power before there be many thing we have to address in this debate one of which be the atrocity that the russian force carry out against ukrainians where they butcher maim rap abuse and burn alive those thing can not be forget about because the family still want justice they want those who carry those atrocity out to be accountable as this process of peace move forward that justice have to be part of the peace process as it be in northern ireland completely agree with the hon gentleman that justice will take time but part of the point that make be that we can not have peace if it be peace without justice justice have to prevail because if it do not we encourage everyone else to think whatever we do we will get away with it next time because they do not have the courage to pursue the justice angle of peace we know that and we have know that over the past or year it be what the nuremberg trial be all about where the idea be for the first time to pursue the aggressor that stand in the hon gentleman case serve in northern ireland as he know and lose good friend still wonder what happen to they even to this day justice for ukraine will take long while and accept that the most interesting thing about the sanction be that some of the lng shipment be do by uk firm see that shell be involve which make it peculiar why we do not step in early will bring my speech to close because know that other wish to speak the problem be that there be an incorrect view and assumption about the importance of defend ukraine that have get lose in the back and forth row that take place over the past week and half the idea that just meet putin demand for territory that he may or may not have at the moment will somehow appease he and satisfy his requirement be completely wrong note that in the telephone call between president trump and putin that be what president trump say be important the truth be that putin be an ex kgb man once kgb always kgb he be not interested in territory he be interested in sovereignty which be key difference thank the right hon gentleman for his powerful speech be originally from west germany as most people know and remind everybody that would not be here without the us presence in germany be it not shame that despite live memory people seem to have forget the powerful status of the us in western europe we need to remind the american president of that think president trump be be remind of that now in america because argument be take place about this issue but do not think that he have forget what we have to get line up be the real nature of what putin want it be not territory but sovereignty we know that he have always want to recreate the full border of the old soviet union in great russia the war with ukraine be not about get of its territory for he it be about get all of ukraine if we have peace deal that be not stable he will be back he will build up his armed force which he can do quite quickly now with the support of country like north korea and he will be back in double quick time who be to say that ukraine will be in any fit state to be able to defend itself it be only able to defend itself because in the period between the seizure of crimea in and the war we and the americans set out about training and arm ukrainian troop in way that make they much well when the russians come in the next time round which be why they do not take kyiv and be drive back that be because we have get ahead of the game with the ukrainians who have much well armed force than they do when russia walk into crimea the reality for we be that there need to be guarantee on anything that happen and do not think that we can separate the americans from the guarantee as the hon member for bath wera hobhouse say america be the ultimate guarantor at the end of the day by the way agree with the americans that the west have ride on the coat tail of the united states for far too long we have be guilty of that we have live life that have allow we to say we claim that defence spending be this amount but it be not really that be one of the reason why president trump be angry about the idea that the americans should be expect to take on this matter so we have to step up be pleased that the prime minister have start the process and wish he all the good in washington but increase defence spending absolutely have to happen the last time we speak point out to he that we face the great threat that we have ever face when the soviet union put missile in europe it be reagan and thatcher support by helmut kohl and other who help lead western europe to take the tough decision to put pershing and cruise missile in order to counter the threat that be brave decision by the leadership and it centre on the uk and the us the prime minister need to remind president trump that when the uk and the us come together for just cause the world be safe place when we be divide it be less safe do not care what anybody else say that relationship be critical to peace and justice in the world and hope that he succeed in achieve that we know that president putin be keen only on sovereignty and the reality be that this be critical for our understanding of what peace would amount to we must not lose sight of the fact that ukraine be important it be important to the americans in way that sometimes do not think they fully understand speak early about the road to taiwan and the threat to taiwan the war in ukraine have damage the global economy at cost of about trillion but any seizure of taiwan would cost the economy near trillion to those who say why should we in this country be worried about taiwan say that of everything produce in the world today be make in the area around taiwan people can not tell that taiwan be not as important as kent be to the united kingdom it be exactly the same why do the road to taiwan run through ukraine it be because if we fail ukraine and it get terrible deal china will look at the situation and say do you know what they never go to step in here because it too far away they will do it they never do they fall out of afghanistan they do do anything when crimea be take they ve give in completely over ukraine and they will do the same over taiwan that be why the road go to taiwan and we will be leave behind because we will not have take the right decision hope the prime minister remind president trump that if we fail on ukraine it will open up the world again to the rule of totalitarian state which will come again and again as churchill say the bitter cup will be proffer to we again and again every time we fail and every time we do not stand up for those who struggle for freedom democracy or justice they will take that and move on we have learn this lesson so many time but we seem to forget it and have to learn it again we must stand with the brave ukrainian man and woman who have lose so much and be go to lose even more if we be not with they and do not find way for ukraine to remain free nation of free people and of choice we be not worth the thousand of year of experience that we have gain from the fight that we have put up previously all will become naught because totalitarianism will rule the day rise order as you can see quite few people wish to contribute so will have to put in place time limit of five minute to begin with thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith and his team for secure this important debate know that he have long be champion of ukraine fight against russia member on both side of the house have loudly support the ukrainian cause and have make excellent contribution in debate prior to today and look forward to hear their contribution in this debate know that many member have recently return from the country and have see at first hand the horror that have be inflict on the ukrainian people have visit the country in september vividly remember my experience the cardiology hospital in kyiv have be hit while child be on the operating table visit the cellar of school in chernihiv oblast where over villager include woman and child be round up and hold captive in march valery former captive hold at the school will forever be haunt by what he see and experience over people be stuff into room so crowd that people be gasp for air include baby who be less than two month old ask valery how he have the strength to go back there and revisit the site with we he say that the story have to be tell and that people need to understand the russian soldier lack of humanity that school will forever be marker of the russians brief occupation of the village it be remarkable that three year after the start of the full scale invasion civilian can still sit in cafés and restaurant in ukrainian city where life appear normal that is until the air raid siren sound it be haunt reminder that the ukrainians be sacrifice great deal not just for themselves but for we our value and our freedom regardless of whether it be our predecessor stand with churchill or the creation of nato under the stewardship of ernest bevin the labour party record on defence have stand the test of time be so proud to live in country that have stand up and stand tall in the face of russian tyranny and imperialism not only through support the ukrainian military but through our welcome those flee the war the united kingdom have welcome over people who flee the conflict through the ukraine family scheme and the homes for ukraine sponsorship scheme in the east midland we have take in ukrainians with my local authority of amber valley welcome nearly do not want to spend more time restate the word and sentiment of those across this house who be support ukraine be sure that many on the frontline be not pay much attention to our platitude and tribute while wave of russian assault pummel they and nor will those in city shelter from what only few day ago be the large drone attack of the war be comfort by word alone no matter how beautiful our rhetoric ukrainians do not sleep any well at night for those word welcome the decision to bring forward the spending commitment to and this money can not come soon enough for the people meet in ukraine also welcome the further money allocate to our intelligence agency to protect this country from the various threat russia pose include cyber attack welcome the government lead the way whether with the late round of sanction announce by the foreign secretary on monday the right hon member for chingford and woodford green mention that or the defence secretary chair the ukraine defence contact group at nato few week ago there be of course much more that we can do and urge the government to consider how the abducted child who be also mention can be return from russia thank my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for call this debate be very pleased to support his application to the backbench business committee before start the speech that have write want to say something about the ukrainian people no one least of all vladimir putin when he launch his illegal invasion three year ago understand what they be take on with the ukrainian people with their spirit ingenuity and incredible ability to innovate and make the most of every single asset at their disposal they have face up to new form of warfare at the same time they have face not only the old school of tank trench and almost hand to hand combat but the high tech of drone digital and modern equipment it show beyond doubt cautionary tale for other who may be think of invade sovereign nation how far people will go and how hard they will fight for their friend neighbour and family and how desperately they will defend their homeland independence language and identity we should all take moment to reflect on that and we should pay tribute to they for their incredible bravery also pay tribute to the british people who have react to this dreadful situation with so much warmth and of course to the government our government and the opposition be united and we act very swiftly in the first day of the unprovoked and illegal invasion prime minister johnson lead from the front in his defence of ukraine and of the ukrainians right to sovereignty and independence he set the pace for other european country to follow and he have the backing of the british people who care about this we care about this in my area of gosport because we have skin in the game it be an area with very proud history of serve our armed force particularly the royal navy it be so typical of the generosity of spirit of gosport people that so many ukrainians make gosport their home must declare an interest because one of those home be and still be mine see the russian tank roll into donbas and towards kyiv and could not stand by and do nothing so my husband and join the homes for ukraine scheme have never speak publicly about that before gosport welcome over ukrainians to our area and few week after we sign up to the homes for ukraine scheme my family and be boost by two woman they be still with we and now refer to they as my ukrainian wife and my ukrainian daughter they and many other have be in the uk for almost three year many of the refugee that the hon lady describe have three year visa but those visa be run out be she worried as be that the government need to look at the extension scheme and ensure that all the ukrainians we have welcome have the ability to plan for the long term it be almost as if the hon member have read what write on my bit of paper it be miraculous want to know her lottery number for next week she be exactly right my own ukrainian family and call they family because they be now part of my family have make life for themselves in this country and they have become an asset to our community in the event of sustainable peace deal ukraine will of course want and need its bright and good to return to rebuild the country but so many of they simply do not have anything to go back to such be the devastation that have be work by russia in destroy civilian building unesco say that almost cultural site have also be lose as result of russia attempt to erase ukrainian heritage and so many of the community that ukrainians have flee just will not be the same they will not have anything to go back to and they will miss the familiar landmark meet place and most importantly and most sadly the people they want to go back to on the point that the hon member and the hon member for bath wera hobhouse make about visa for ukrainian refugee do they recognise that the government have already extend the visa scheme by month that decision be make this month and it have be welcome at least by the ukrainian refugee in my constituency yes that be very welcome lot of people from the ukrainian community want certainty about what to expect and about the security of the world around they to follow on from an early comment we hear lot about planning for the war but want to know little more about the government planning for the peace and work towards day when many ukrainians will be able to return to their home country what about those here under the scheme who have make home relationship and job here and be contribute to the economy and community in which they live will they be able to stay indefinitely people be begin to ask that question and as much as we understand that ukraine will want its bright and well back there be some who simply do not have anything to go back to to conclude contrary to the messaging come out of the munich security conference there be value that we all share as european country which we must now pay to defend however we must not just use word we must show action and we must show solidarity suppose want to give the minister who know care about this very deeply the opportunity to affirm the government commitment that as the geopolitical weather change our dedication as nation and as government and an opposition to ukraine its incredible and indefatigable people and their democratically elect president will never waver thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for call this debate be proud to support his application be with he on the trip to ukraine few week ago with that fantastic charity hopefull which he mention if someone have tell year ago year later you will be stand with the conservative sir iain duncan smith in the snow cook pizza in ukraine would never have believe they it be fascinating visit and an important one the visit highlight the cross party nature of the support for ukraine that the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage will call she my hon friend have point out it be so important particularly in comparison with other country there be also role for back benchers across the party to put pressure on our respective front benchers to ensure that we work together on this issue into the future we be mark the three year point of this absolutely terrible war start by vladimir putin it be an illegal war and one of brutality and barbarism and conflict in which ukraine be literally fight for its life for its existence as free and independent nation state however as the first line of the national anthem of ukraine say the glory and freedom of ukraine have not yet perish despite the good effort of the dictator vladimir putin we hear early about the scale of the war and the destruction it have work we have hear about the hundred of thousand of death of young man and woman on all side of the conflict the thousand of civilian woman girl and boy kill and the many million injure and the almost million ukrainian refugee and many more internally displace people the long they be away from their home the less likely it be that they will return civilian casualty rise by in the last year of the war russia have increase its use of aerial bomb drone missile and loitering munition we hear about the ukrainian hospital in kyiv their version of great ormond street hospital which have be visit by many hon member what kind of regime deliberately target hospital landmine now contaminate sq km of ukraine pose real risk to civilian and the future of the country in the last month there be attack on medical facility and attack on school nearly double the number in the previous year we talk about the rule of war not be follow by vladimir putin armed force disgracefully the un have record an alarming spike in the number of ukrainian soldier execute by russian armed force there be credible allegation of at least execute in the past six month people make reference to ukrainian prisoner of war who be subject to appal crime torture sexual violence and much much more then there be the child vladimir putin face warrant from the international criminal court for abduct thousand of child the yale school of public health humanitarian research lab say conservatively that there be at least child hold at camp in russia at the moment there have also be the incredible spectre of north korean troop fight on this continent for terrible dictatorship want to talk very briefly because time be short about the security guarantee that ukraine need as the discussion about peace in ukraine develop one of my concern be the way that vladimir putin suggest that there should be limit on the ukrainian armed force after peace the good security guarantee be the one operate at the moment well equip well armed ukrainian armed force the brave man and woman of ukraine who have hold back vladimir putin evil army the first principle in any discussion of security guarantee or peace be nothing about ukraine without ukraine further principle in those negotiation have to be the need to understand the character of the man we be deal with he be compulsive liar who break his word at every opportunity that be why the guarantee be so incredibly important after munich and the destabilising comment make by some character in foreign government it be natural to be cautious in this place we should be hard headed and should talk realistically about what britain need to do do the hon gentleman find it ironic that the conference at munich seem like the shadow of previous conference at munich at which the sudetenland be give away and which make it certain that the second world war would take place do he think that we may end up in the same position if we be not careful do one interesting thing to note after munich and recent discussion be that some of this stuff be not new the united states have be tell europe to pay for its own defence and to step up for many many year if the commitment to make in wales in have be keep by all the country that sign up to it we would have spend another billion on our collective defence since that time country need to step up and ensure that they meet their commitment we need to be realistic about our role we be lead european partner lead member of nato and lead ally of the united states worry that in the past two week some people have be very quick to throw out year of important transatlantic alliance but it be crucial for the security of this country and the security of our continent thank the hon gentleman for that comment do he agree that talk about the end of nato be very dangerous way of put thing we in europe can not continue with nato without the united states in it and it be important to remind the united states of that completely agree and that be why have be reassure by the government talk about our have nato first defence policy the prime minister reaffirm that this week give all the drama in the past couple of week it have be reassure to see the steady hand and leadership that the prime minister the defence secretary and the government as whole have show on these issue they have react calmly and coolly to the challenge that have be pose yesterday we see the whole house give the prime minister its good wish and offer he good luck with his urgent task of convince president trump of the importance of ukraine to the security of the united states and europe there be also the very important link refer to early with dictatorship across the world we should not allow the principle of might be right to succeed because then we go down very dangerous road indeed when this country be fight for its life there be dangerous tendency for british politician to always refer back to that time be go to fall into that trap harry hopkins president roosevelt great personal friend be here in the uk he give speech in glasgow to reassure churchill in those dark day of december which he finish with quote from the book of ruth whither thou goest will go and where thou lodgest will lodge thy people shall be my people even to the end that should be the attitude of britain europe and the united states to ukraine solidarity unyielde support and remember that the glory and freedom of ukraine have not yet perish thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure the debate and for give the opportunity to support it the third anniversary of russia late full scale invasion of ukraine be point at which we must all reflect not just on the war but on what be at stake for all of we last week attend gathering in my constituency where meet ukrainians who be happy to say have find home in lewes and across sussex many of they arrive in the uk flee war but they have do far more than rebuild their life they have form support network keep ukrainian culture alive their singing be really beautiful and send aid back home include christmas present for child in ukrainian hospital child whose life have be shatter by russian bomb often think of the child still in ukraine child just like mine three year ago they would have go to school in the morning come home and play with their friend and sibling have bit of dinner and go to bed only to be wake up in the night by air raid siren and their parent rush they to underground bomb shelter where they will have listen to russian missile smash into their home above their head that be the reality of this war for innocent people family and child whose only crime be live in country that putin decide to target as we can all see ukrainian resistance have be nothing short of heroic for three year against the odd the ukrainian people have proudly stand their ground fight not just for their own freedom but for the kind of world we all want to live in britain must be clear we stand with ukraine from day one the uk have not only provide military aid and training but put economic pressure on russia british family have open their home to ukrainian refugee today however the west commitment be be test in way never think would witness with president trump peddle russian propaganda directly from the white house the future of us support be uncertain let be clear if america waver then britain and europe must step up that entail action not just word ukraine must have the necessary weapon economic support and long term investment to not only survive but win that mean go even far defrost and seize the billion in frozen russian asset stash in london paris berlin and elsewhere and convert they into financial lifeline for ukraine the threat be not limit to ukraine the right hon member for chingford and woodford green mention taiwan and how heavily that part of the world be affect by this situation but draw attention to russia hybrid warfare close to home it be target and destabilising country such as georgia moldova romania and belarus kremlin back elite such as belarus dictator aleksandr lukashenko and georgian oligarch bidzina ivanishvili be work to undermine democracy and pull their country back into moscow orbit britain can not allow putin crony to operate unchecked we must follow the us and the european parliament in sanction those enable his war machine if putin be allow to win in ukraine he will not stop there he will redraw europe border by force and other tyrant will be watch this be not just about defend ukraine sovereignty it be about defend the liberal rule base international order that safeguard we all an order our nation help to build to constrain great power from exploit the less powerful by for instance extract valuable raw material at the point of gun some say britain should step back abandon our ally and retreat from global leadership but history will judge the choice we make now do we appease aggression or do we stand firm in the face of tyranny as previously mention we all wish the prime minister well in his discussion on these issue with the us president today there be no middle ground either we let putin tighten his grip on europe or we push back look to the future any peace deal must be just that and not temporary ceasefire that allow putin force to rest rearm and go again it must be back with real security guarantee and clearly state that russia start this war and that it bear responsibility for the consequence some speak about pick side in the new geopolitical landscape but there be only one side that the uk can back the side of freedom the rule of law and the liberal international order the side that reflect the value of this country and believe this house so as say there be no middle ground either we let putin tighten his grip on europe or we push back we must push back by arm ukraine cripple russia war economy and stand unwavering in our commitment to ukraine victory because its fight be our fight too this be battle for freedom and justice and battle we can not afford to lose thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for bring forward this debate be happy to support it like some colleague in the chamber spend sunday evening in an underground bomb shelter in kyiv as russia launch massive drone attack on the city and many other across ukraine while it be terrifying experience be proud to join the uk cross party delegation to ukraine to mark the third anniversary of putin illegal invasion it be of course grim milestone in conflict that have claim the life of thousand of innocent ukrainian civilian and displace many many more as the only female mp on the delegation it would be remiss of not to tell the house about the vital role that ukrainian woman be play in this conflict as james brown once say it man world but it would be nothing without woman strength and bravery take many form and ukrainian woman have show extraordinary resilience in not just defend ukraine against russian aggression but rebuild nation that refuse to be break as the house will know when russian force invade ukraine on february president zelensky order that all able bodied man age to be to remain in the country to bolster ukraine defence but ukrainian woman also step up today more than woman be sign up to the ukrainian army one in of those woman hold senior position and more than be engage directly in frontline combat this week have the pleasure of meet some of the woman who have serve on the frontline there be no mandatory conscription for ukrainian woman mean that every single woman who have sign up have do so voluntarily drive by their immovable resolve to defend their home however woman be also play vital role off the battlefield and have be vital in sustain the economy against putin war machine ukraine have change the law so that woman can fill labour gap in mining transportation logistic and agriculture ensure those critical sector continue to function in the face of bombardment and destruction from putin force today one in every two new business start in ukraine be start by woman meet woman this week who be camp out in drone factory make the kit that be be send to the frontline ukrainian woman be do all this while many of they have lose their father brother and husband the hon lady make very powerful point there be time in this place when it be very difficult to keep one composure when speak she be do fantastic job all our heart go out to those ukrainian people and they certainly deserve all our support thank the right hon lady for her intervention while those ukrainian woman be fight and sustain their country they be also the mother to the child who have be kidnap by russia want to tell the house why the fourth point of president zelensky peace formula be so vital to ensure just end to this war when russian force invade the eastern oblast in ukraine they deport and forcibly remove child from ukraine to russia this be genocide in international law as we know it in one case child only eight month old be take by russian force his new name and date of birth be unknown russia have consistently deny the existence of this child and thousand of other some of these child end up in russia youth military conscript to fight war against the country they be bear in this be war crime before any ceasefire the steal child of ukraine must be return home talk of tank bullet drone and machine gun be unlikely to move the mind of people who live so far from ukraine it be the story of the woman who be play an essential role in this war that will move those mind it be their story their fight for survival and their fight for the value of democracy that we in this house hold so dear and must support with all our might slava ukraini start by congratulate my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on secure this important debate and salute he for the incredible work he have do in lead on this issue as always it be hugely hearten to see so many colleague from across the house in the chamber it serve as timely reminder of the united approach that we have take on this issue and of our resolute and undiminishe support for the ukrainian people in my constituency we have welcome many ukrainian family and be always touch and move by their story of resilience in the face of the great hardship many member have speak before not just in this debate but through the course of the week about the importance of the government welcome announcement of increase defence spending and the need for our ally also to step up to the plate while do not intend to repeat those argument today will add that we alone do not determine our defence spending it be our enemy too but it be also our ally with the united states announce potential step back from their support for ukraine it be clear that we as nation have an overriding obligation not only to ukraine but to our citizen and the wide world to step up and keep putin war machine at bay if we fail to do so we will be open the gate to totalitarian regime across the world the reality be that the united kingdom have armed force that be fit for peace however over the past eight month or so we have enter much more dangerous arena and we need to be ready for any outcome in the time available to want to raise two further point first reiterate the point make by my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green on the increasingly press need to release the billion in frozen russian asset to aid the ukrainian government in the rebuilding of their country secondly want to pick up on my right hon friend comment about what we can and must learn as an armed force from this conflict and from the heroic effort of the ukrainian military with many make the ultimate sacrifice in defence of the sovereignty of their country the war have show clear shift in the nature of warfare and in the nature of each serve person work reality war be now in much more hybrid state fight not only in traditional land and maritime realm but back in basis in remote location yet we still follow traditional medical guideline set out who can serve and who do not have the opportunity to do so this where feel we can learn from ukraine which very early on in the conflict amend and adjust many of the medical requirement for its serve personnel in our military there be often mindset of soldier first which may well exempt someone who have suffer knee injury while play sport at school anyone with raynaud phenomenon for example or anyone wear glass over certain prescription rather than make generic medical exemption list for the whole force invite the minister at least to consider tailor the medical requirement to the position be apply for for example what be the chance of person glass be blow off if they be operate from chair in drone centre hundred of mile away what be the reality of an intelligence officer in remote location look at satellite information lose the feeling in their finger due to the cold because of raynaud phenomenon what be the chance of royal navy dental officer not be able to complete check up because of pain in his knee we need to be much more flexible although accept that there be certain degree of hyperbole in my argument the point be make be serious one if we be to turn the tide on our recruitment policy and difficulty in this country we need to tailor the medical requirement to the specific role we must become more versatile and adaptive as fighting force like our friend in ukraine as country we be often guilty of prepare for the war that we have have rather than the war that we will face in the future as we reflect on the three year since putin illegal invasion say to the government that we should not waste any more time or waste what we have learn at the cost of so many thousand ukrainian life congratulate the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on secure this debate and all those who have speak today it be václav havel who say that the good defence against tyranny be to live in truth on this third anniversary we have the opportunity to repeat some truth to this house that ukraine be democracy that democracy need defend and that the good way to defend democracy be for democratic nation to come together with unity of purpose around our value we should not have to remind the world that ukraine be democracy but some have impugn that we in this house know that at time all democracy face challenge let we be honest this country once have to suspend election during the height of world war two gosh be even old enough to remember when thousand of people invade the united states congress because they want to overturn democratic election and nullify the result and the election of president biden let we send clear message from this house that we do not regard president zelensky as dictator we regard he as hero of democracy and we in the west should have his back we must also remember that at time democracy will need defend especially against dictator especially when it come to russia president zelensky be on the frontline of an effort to re contain russia on behalf of we all russia be country that invade its neighbour time and time again it have be invade its neighbour since the day of ivan the terrible it have invade its neighbour on eight different occasion since on average that be once every decade since the end of the second world war face with that threat why on earth would we make concession now some people have be lose in this war in russia russia now face nato that be big and strong russia will run out of tank in april and it have lose more artillery system in the past year than in the previous two year put together russia at the height of the war control of ukrainian territory today it control in the face of that weakness why on earth would we make concession now to those who want to make russia great again we should confront they with strength not weakness because that be how peace be secure finally it be vital for we across the west to unite around our value to celebrate those value and not to attack each other be worried that what begin as political improvisation in the united states have now become under the new president political project be worried that some of the noise that hear sound like the report that thucydides make of the athenian threat all those century ago which be that the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must in this country we know how that story end when we talk about the rule base order we do not mean the rule of the poker table or even the rule that we set out at the end of world war two we believe not simply in rule base order but in right base order the right that ensure our freedom be enshrine in the un universal declaration of human right at the end of world war two and in the council of europe european convention on human right co author by this country base on churchill great vision of great charter those be the right that we should be celebrate because they mean freedom for all of we those right value and freedom must be defend with strength so the prime minister decision to increase defence spending be right this house will need reassurance that that money can be well spend but crucially give the cut that be to be make to the aid budget we must think hard creatively and quickly about how we now lead great multilateral effort to increase the amount of aid spend around the world we need to think in this anniversary of the bretton woods institution about how we reinvent the world bank and the international monetary fund for new time so that they be big and well in the world to come that be the way that we become evangelist for the right that be now be defend so valiantly by ukrainian force on the continent of europe thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure this important debate recognise that quite rightly the debate have focus on our responsibility to support ukraine war effort against putin unprovoked and illegal attack in ukraine but wish to talk about our continue commitment to ukrainians here as the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage and my hon friend the member for bath wera hobhouse both mention since the start of russia invasion of ukraine more than ukrainians have arrive in the uk under the ukraine family and sponsorship scheme be incredibly proud of my constituency of chichester which have take more ukrainian refugee than any other city in this country and those refugee have now become value part of our community now more than ever we must stand firmly with our ukrainian friend both in defend their sovereign territory and in ensure that those who be here can live safely and comfortably the original visa scheme as the minister will know be for three year and with the three year anniversary be mark this week many visa be now expire the government have ask ukrainians to apply for the ukraine permission extension scheme which will extend their visa for further month however they be allow to apply for that extension scheme only when their visa have day or few leave on it this be cause myriad difficulty for that community include in their ability to renew employment contract extend lease or set up new lease on rented accommodation or commit to education opportunity have the opportunity to visit bishop luffa school in chichester last month and meet group of ukrainian student who have not only become well like by staff and student but have excel in their study and be expect to finish their level with high grade across the board in subject such as mathematic and the science those student be the doctor and the scientist of the future yet there be no clear direction from the department for education on how they should pursue high education be it via the same route as their uk counterpart with whom they have study as refugee or as international student have raise this matter with the secretary of state for education and hope that there will be clear guidance in the near future for student who be desperate to study in the uk have speak to many ukrainian family who have make their home in glastonbury and somerton after flee russian aggression in ukraine many of they be concerned about the decision to exclude time spend in the uk under the long residence route which be different from other scheme and could be subject to costly legal challenge do my hon friend share my concern about this absolutely share my hon friend concern about the fact that the time spend here be not count towards the right to remain or settle status as the hon member for gosport mention these family have find home and build community here in the uk and they just want to know either way what will happen to they in the future the young people be speak about be often care for by one parent or by grandparent while their other family member defend ukraine sovereignty some family have report that estate agent be request from these single parent ukrainian family six month up front rental deposit that be untenable across the country but especially in area such as chichester where the average one bedroom flat be month employer be also ask for proof of visa status which be cause family additional stress when they be wait for visa decision sometimes just day before their visa expire for those ukrainians on zero hour contract it be directly impact their ability to earn money to contribute to uk society and provide safe home for they and their dependant if the ukrainians be give day window before their visa expire as originally propose by the home office rather than the very short timeframe they be be give the situation could be vastly improve thank opora the uk charity support ukrainians here in the uk for all the support that it be give those family who be navigate what can often be complicated convoluted and long process of reapplying for these scheme and for take the time to brief properly on the situation that these family find themselves in today debate will rightly be dominate by what we can do for ukraine and our steadfast support across the house but hope that the minister be work closely with his home office colleague so that while we support the brave ukrainians who be heroically defend their country we can also continue to support the community of ukrainians here in the uk yesterday read through speech make three year ago in which say ukrainians and president zelensky have display the high level of bravery in the face of brutal russian aggression in the eye of vladimir putin ukrainians have make an unforgivable choice they decide to be an independent and democratic country like all dictator putin be terrify of lose power that do not fit with this plan of great russia again my speech continue ukrainians have make their choice they want to be european country they want to become member of nato they want to be free to make their own choice make no mistake ukrainians be fight this war on behalf of all of we who be part of the free and democratic world then say we must support they as if the future of our country and our way of life depend on it because quite frankly it do official report march vol the world be watch the conflict the dictator of the world have become emboldened over the past decade in china russia iran and north korea russia will push far with moldova seemingly next my speech go on to urge more action as ukraine be ask for help and each day decision be be deliberate that should have be do much more quickly as be say early we be not fight this properly the world be not together it be big issue it be not just fight between two country it be russia it be putin he be an evil man as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith say he be kgb thank the right hon member for his wonderful opening speech putin be inhuman north korea be involve in this china iran and north korea be all work together on this it have be plan agree entirely with what be say early be with some north koreans here on tuesday night they be fight they have at russia disposal in ukraine when they be kill or maim their face and hand be burn off so that they can not be recognise as north koreans that be how evil putin be in putin take crimea without any consequence he orchestrate the bombing that result in the death of of his own people to start war to take power he have his political rival shoot for oppose war he approve poisoning on british soil result in the death of british citizen he pre record his declaration of war on ukraine after which he pretend to be open to diplomacy putin will not stop he can not be appease understand why nato could not get directly involve yet short of that we should have be do absolutely everything at much speedy pace do not point finger of blame at anyone but we be not look at this as seriously as we should this be as much calamity as last week the world be shock to quote will hutton in the observer on sunday the spill ukrainian blood count for nothing as the elect president of the united states openly side with russia to achieve peace that can only reward it for its unilateral aggression as profoundly the us president have launch new era in which might be right strong man carve up the globe and international law and multilateral institution be eviscerate nor as the former head of alex younger tell bbc newsnight be there any go back our thought and support be with our prime minister especially today we wish he every success in his discussion later today we all have to step up and be absolutely united we have to grow up if may say so we be talk about thing but we should be look at other thing now we be at war it be so very important for the world we in reform stand united with the whole house in support of ukraine and all brave ukrainians against the monstrous tyranny of that most evil villain putin will the hon gentleman give way have not even warm up will make little more progress just over month ago make donation to acquire pick up truck and to fill it with first aid supply and drive it with other volunteer to ukraine to give it to those brave soldier on the frontline remember meet the extraordinary technician who be make the drone include brilliant bright child who be help to develop new drone technology tragically stand in cemetery and watch mum weep over the graf of their son that cemetery have almost double in size in just month the maxim of peace through strength have stand the test of time in history today and in future that be why in our contract at the election we have of gdp on defence spending within three year and within six year that be why we support the prime minister early this week when he make those same commitment hope that that will be firm commitment within five or six year peace through strength be vital as other have say we all want peace not least the brave ukrainians it must be right to try for peace deal however difficult most war and conflict end up in some form of negotiation however difficult tough or tense give how the hon gentleman start his speech do he agree with the leader of his party the hon member for clacton nigel farage who be probably not in clacton right now who say in that vladimir putin be the global leader he most admire putin be vile dictator we all know that my leader have also confirm that putin be the aggressor in this war be just move on in the time allot to the issue of how we get to durable peace respect the hon gentleman personal position but can he explain why the leader of his party think that the priority for president zelensky should be to set timetable for election give that winston churchill when face dictator do not hold election because we be under martial law the point about election be good one because any peace deal can only work if it have the support and involvement of all ukrainians in the second world war we have election in the summer of before the war have end which be completely appropriate then at some point the ukrainians will need to be involve in support peace deal if we get there peace deal however be only durable it only work if it endure that mean we need the security guarantee to ensure that the aggressor will never ever attack again it be those security guarantee that we must focus on all be involve in and ensure that they be strong robust deterrent if we get those security guarantee right hopefully putin and russia will never try such monstrous activity and invasion ever again too like many hon friend and members across the house return from ukraine only last night after the monstrous hour journey be mentally and physically exhausted after the experience and can not sum up in five minute what experience could talk about it for day really thank my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and the uk friends of ukraine and banker for net zero for the visit they organise it be truly fantastic to be there but also deeply emotional have nothing but respect and admiration for the ukrainian people for their stoicism and resolve in get through this illegal war they just keep function as though it be normal life the building get bomb but they do not just leave they crumble on the ground they rebuild they the soldier injure on the frontline be in hospital but tell we they want to get back there as soon as possible those be the ingredient for country that be set to take on putin and set to win this war experience two night in an air raid shelter the first

up there that night be in the shelter alone during which there be lot of time to reflect include on what be go on outside the more the night go on the more fearful become especially when hear that there be not just drone but missile potentially fly around above my head the ukrainians go through that every night and have be for three year massive mental health and post traumatic stress disorder issue be develop among ukrainian citizen and we need to be there and ready to support they when they come through the conflict it will be really big issue for the country up in chernihiv have chance to meet people who be on the frontline with belarus and russia every single day they be impact by the war in way that we can not imagine meet the governor who have some statistic prepare in presentation of how many building have be destroy this year how many people have be injure and how many have be kill he say to oh be sorry that statistic be wrong because another building be destroy this morning and another three people be kill it be constantly change the great message get from ukraine and its people be that they be incredibly grateful for the support that the united kingdom have give they since day one and continue to give they today they see we as the leader in the support to get they through this conflict and that come from so many ukrainians this war be real witness that for myself as do my hon friend with bomb out building everywhere and air raid take place that be really bring home to on the day in lviv which be not massively impact as it be close to the western

provide we with this platform to show the house at its good come together in the face of russian aggression in ukraine it be chance for we to stand together in solidarity three year ago the world

mind forever yet despite the kremlin relentless aggression the ukrainian people have show extraordinary courage determination and resilience and we have share some of those story in here today they continue to fight not just for their homeland but for the principle that underpin our own security here democracy sovereignty and the rule of law have have the privilege of visit ukraine twice first

stark meet parliamentarian civil society leader and local official many of whom have lose love one in the conflict their resilience be and still be unwavering their determination be undimmed it be that spirit of theirs that must continue to guide we in this place in our response the uk have lead the way in support ukraine the previous conservative government be among the first to provide advanced weaponry include anti tank missile long range precision weapon and air defence system we play key role in train ukrainian troop and co ordinating international military aid so welcome the government commitment to billion in annual military aid until the decade end however that support must continue to ensure ukraine have the weapon and the strategic backing need to defeat russian aggression let we be clear this be not just about help ukraine this be about our own national security russia action represent the most blatant breach of sovereignty and territorial integrity see in europe since the second world war if we falter in the face of that aggression we invite further instability we know that putin ambition do not stop at ukraine border the threat that he pose to nato ally include in the baltic region be real and grow that be why welcome the government decision to increase spending on defence to of gdp by that be an important step albeit overdue and commend the government for recognise as my party do that our security require sustained investment the war in ukraine have demonstrate the power of people to people solidarity as my right hon friend for chingford and romford west hope get that right interruption be be prompt that it be chingford and woodford green my hon friend the member for romford andrew rosindell would be upset by that he would be actually he be ever present always present be he the uk homes for ukraine scheme have provide sanctuary to thousand of ukrainians flee war pay tribute to the british family who have open their home include those in my constituency and the community that have welcome they with open arm their kindness reflect the very good of our country ask the minister whether the government would consider some sort of recognition scheme or way of thank those family at the appropriate time for their kindness and generosity this week as we mark this grim anniversary we must ensure that those displace by war continue to receive the support they need both here and in ukraine we must remain resolute in hold russia accountable and our response must be unwavering ensure that we tackle all aspect of russian aggression let be clear ukraine fight be our fight if we stand by ukraine today we strengthen our own security for the future if we falter we embolden aggressor everywhere as member have say number of we be in ukraine at the end of last week and four day ago we be sit in bomb shelter in kyiv as the ukrainian military work to clear the sky of drone kyiv be beautiful european city one of the great city of europe fill with freedom love well educate population that be commit to liberate their country and it be place no different from our own we be there as one of strong delegation to the yalta european strategy conference never before in the history of that conference have that city come under bombardment while european parliamentarian be present so great do russia consider the risk of kill member of nato country something have change and we all know what it be we need to wake up for most of america history the country have be isolationist after the first world war it retreat back into isolationism after the second it would have do so be it not for the cold war since the end of the cold war september bring george bush back into the world have be elect on programme of isolationism all three democratic presidents since the end of the cold war have in part retreat from international affair that be the default status of america and we have to wake up to that reality it be not about single american president this be about the future of europe it be about the fact that we no long can rely on an american security guarantee be we live in peaceful time that would be worry enough but the fact be that europe be at war the argument against appeasement have already be well make and we know that if ukraine fall it would be nato country next and in all possibility general nuclear war as part of putin quest to rebuild the russian empire we must accept the reality that we be at war cold war but war none the less neutral country do not attack uk infrastructure or test uk airspace and territorial water neutral country do not release nerve agent into the street of salisbury or openly discuss in the paper as they be do now that the americans have give they licence to bomb london those be the action of an enemy state since the announcement on tuesday which greatly agree with have receive correspondence from constituent express concern about the cut to international aid want to be frank that many more painful decision will follow if we be to do what be necessary to ensure the defence of our country against an enemy power we must mobilise with no american security guarantee the only choice be european security guarantee of which the uk must play central role for we this will be mobilisation not of man and woman for the most part if we must replace the total manpower of the us military that number one million already exist within the ukrainian armed force ukraine do not need the people they be already on europe frontline hold back the enemy they need our combine economic and intellectual power across the continent dedicate to our collective victory speak with those in ukraine not only politician soldier and analyst but the everyday resident who we meet along our travel they be determined to go on fight however long it take alone if they must hand to hand if totally necessary we can not allow thing to come to that three year into the combat why do ukrainians still want for bullet and shell why do they struggle to access sufficient electronic countermeasure why be we train soldier in batch in the uk and have not set up college in ukraine to train they en masse if putin be stand on the french coast would we have not resolve this in month if not week we be at war it be war we can and must win to do that we must be prepare to do whatever it take start today slava ukraini pay tribute to the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for his outstanding and comprehensive speech many people have die in this war so far and united nations figure suggest that at least civilian have lose their life and over have be injure with nearly war crime commit and civilian building destroy by russia since the full scale invasion begin of course the true death toll be likely to be far high as ukraine and international body do not have access to russian occupy area of ukraine or area on the frontline most particularly the city of mariupol which be largely destroy in the brutal russian siege this be tragedy that can not continue and yet amid so much darkness chink of light be how this war have show the very good of our nation our generosity towards ukraine and how we have welcome refugee and work internationally to get co operation against russia in my oxfordshire constituency of didcot and wantage the vale of white horse and south oxfordshire district council have go long way to welcome and help refugee and many family have host they enable by the homes for ukraine scheme the village of north moreton with population of just have host dozen of people earn significant medium coverage for its generosity many family have also be host in the small village of brightwell cum sotwell want to give an example of the journey face by one of those family mother and her two child age and six when they come have already flee donetsk in in the first russian aggression against ukraine and then yet again in to the united kingdom the year old subsequently manage to get place at the university of nottingham and have start his study the mother take her six year old back to ukraine last april have miss her husband so much and their uk host family be still in regular contact with she and her son in didcot stanislav of the help ukraine group support or hugs have collect enormous amount of clothing toiletry tool and many other item and have send huge pallet over to ukraine one place that receive they be the place of kindness shelter for displace family in chernivtsi which have help shelter over family orphan and critically ill child the same organisation collect and donate laptop to the reading base ukrainian school lastivka to enable child to get online and gain it literacy want to say little about why care so much about the ukraine war beyond the obvious reason have polish mother and poland be country that have also hugely suffer under russian oppression in the past and retain genuine fear of that nation to this day this war matter to ukraine and to europe but it also matter specifically to we we hop that russia would stop after its invasion of georgia it do not we hop that russia would stop after annex crimea in it do not we hop that russia would stop after year of war in the donbas it do not we hop that russia would stop after its brutal bombing of syria in support of dictator bashar al assad in the late it do not it be important that we learn from that and ensure that any peace we do have do not far embolden russia where do we go from here well our community and council need long term support to continue host refugee and look after ukrainians many hon member have already make eloquent remark about that we all want peace but it have to be on ukraine term there be so much talk at the moment of peace guarantee we should remember that there have be such guarantee before under the budapest memorandum ukraine give up its nuclear weapon in return for suppose guarantee of its peace so we can not have cheap talk of guarantee now we need to learn why previous one do not work of course we need european defence co operation and investment in our armed force many hon member have be optimistic that the united states will not turn permanently away from europe but in case that optimism be misplace we need to build up our defence force and co operate across europe use frozen russian asset so that we have the high quality and competent defence force that our continent need this war have bring huge suffering to the people of ukraine destroy community separate family and orphan child however it have also show the human spirit of justice compassion and kindness to be great unify force we must now work with our european ally to secure the freedom and prosperity of ukraine and our continent keep our nation safe and preserve ukraine for the future mean show putin that we and our european ally have the resolve and the resource to defeat he show he that we would win any war be the good way to prevent wide conflict win war be matter of resource be convert to fight force we lose the first battle of world war two but we win by convert our great resource lincoln do the same during the american civil war so it be now we must reduce russian resource and prepare ourselves russia economy be strain at the seam putin demand for war matériel be outstrip the ability of his economy to supply it the official inflation rate stand at and we may possibly be talk about double that three quarter of russian firm face staff shortage putin be lose tank three time more quickly than he can replace they and his national wealth fund have be halve however russia be still out produce we in shell and fighting force and its armed force will reach million personnel russia can rebuild and putin will rebuild and come back so we can and must do more to reduce russia resource first we must seize central bank asset rather than allow putin to use they to rebuild his fighting force secondly we must strengthen the oil price cap by make london insurance for foreign port dependent on the proper verification of attestation document thirdly we need strong export control to stop western good end up in russian tank that be what we can do right now deter putin and defeat putin be one and the same our economic power be great nato gdp in europe be time great than putin in russia convert that economic power into fighting force be what we must do next prosperity mean nothing if we do not have the force to defend it so yes this be about the percentage that we spend on defence but for europe as whole it be also about so much more than that long term order to build production capacity secure strategic input such as steel and the ability to scale rapidly if we must if we do face war we must be prepare for it fight total war convert an entire nation production to maximise fighting force be problem that none of we have ever know but that could be the economic problem before we maximise the production of war gun tank drone the rough outline of the answer be this we must figure out national income decide the maximum portion that can be allocate to war matériel production and use taxis from those who can most afford they to transfer what be need to the government if demand run ahead of supply it will lead to inflation that mean ration consumption for more investment investment will have to go towards war matériel so capital control must be in place we need import control and quota to ensure that input such as steel be go towards war matériel we must prepare for financial world without lend lease those be the preparation that the treasury should be make we could not foresee the financial crisis or the pandemic but we can foresee great war in europe these be the time in which we live in the dark day of our struggle against fascism john maynard keynes write reluctance to face the full magnitude of our task and overcome it be coward part yet the nation be not in this mood and only ask to be tell what be necessary that be where the british people be nation that remember its fine hour but where be we in this house be we prepare for the bad so that we can prevent it be we show that we will convert our far great resource in order to protect europe and ourselves be we ready to do what we must those be the question before we rise order before call the next speaker inform the house that as want to get as many member in as can will immediately bring the time limit on speech down to four minute and it may go lower thank the other hon member who take part in the visit to ukraine for their powerful speech share their emotion about the visit last saturday be particularly emotional for because visit recovery centre for wounded soldier in ukraine meet soldier call volodymyr who have lose both his leg in drone strike on his vehicle his comrade have try to rescue he four time but each time they be turn back by drone attack his tourniquet hold and after nine hour they eventually get he out his spirit be unbroken hear his story and see his courage be inspiring we in parliament and the british armed force have enormous respect for everything that the ukrainian armed force have achieve ukrainians continue to make an enormous sacrifice yet every ukrainian meet tell that they do not want trump propose ceasefire they want to fight on because they be fight to win their choice to fight and our choice to support their fight be not warmongere rather it be the choice to save life putin break ceasefire he will regroup attack again and kill even more the only acceptable term be those under which ukraine be victorious russia be vulnerable now in the past six month it have fail to retake its territory in kursk and have suffer over casualty to advance just km in eastern casualty per kilometre largely because ukraine be out produce it in drone ukraine have clear path to victory european nato gdp alone be time the size of russia however we be not convert that economic strength into military power russia be still spend billion more annually on the war than ukraine and her western ally if we close that gap and exceed that spend by seize the billion in frozen russian asset ukraine will win trump propose ceasefire would free up battle harden russian troop who could crash into the baltic state and achieve putin dream of restore the soviet union it be far well to defeat russia in ukraine than end up directly at war we can not trust trump to defend ukraine and we can not trust he to defend we so we must rearm with article in doubt the small democracy include the united kingdom and ukraine must consider new western alliance that be strong enough for we to defend ourselves together it be particularly move to see volodymyr because his sacrifice be also on our behalf in fact many ukrainians remind that they be compare their sacrifice to our sacrifice in when it be our country responsibility to defend democracy during our dark hour we would do well to remember that legacy as we consider the fate of not just ukraine but the free world it be pleasure to take part in such well inform and passionate debate three year on from putin illegal invasion of ukraine the courage of the ukrainian people be an inspiration to all of we be at the munich security conference where it feel like the world change around we and significant consequence flow from it it be clear that any settlement negotiate solely between trump and putin would not be dignified and secure peace for ukraine as democratically elect president zelensky have say there can be no peace in ukraine without ukraine and no peace in europe without europe european leader include our prime minister and our parliament rightfully stand in full solidarity with he with its war machine in full swing we know that russia would not stop with ukraine give the opportunity and we must be clear that this be about security for the uk too our prime minister be do vital work in washington dc today with that in mind the dramatic divergence of us and european approach really matter and we have to be clear about how many other country now have an interest in ukraine with north korean troop on the frontline iranian drone be use and technology be provide by china we be not just up against russia in ukraine this be about group of state that be seek to disrupt an already fracture global order secure just and last peace in ukraine have become the defining test of who our ally be in the world and how far we be willing to go to defend the value of freedom democracy and sovereignty that unite we the last three year have see attack on healthcare facility in ukraine the most ever record by the world health organisation in conflict these attack have increase in the last year and now occur almost daily do my hon friend agree that when this conflict end we must examine closely the potential use of chemical weapon by vladimir putin during this conflict as he have previously use they in syria and other conflict some of we who be on the trip that have be discuss see that at first hand in hospital absolutely agree accountability be essential more than decade ago putin test the tactic of attack hospital in his operation in syria and the world stand by the message about impunity spread and we have subsequently see the same tactic use by other force in gaza and sudan and now by putin in ukraine child should never be target in war and the international criminal court have an arrest warrant out for putin for his deportation of ukrainian child to russia the stability and prosperity that we have enjoy in our part of the world for the last year can not be take for grant it be fight for literally democracy do not just happen we have to want it value it work to keep it and protect it and we have much work to do in that regard in my previous work in war zone across the world often return home with the sense that conflict and disaster can happen anywhere that be why we need to support our global institution now more than ever institution such as the united nations and the framework of international law put in place after world war two if we value those achievement we must uphold and protect they our government be absolutely right to increase defence spending rapidly have see too many time as former aid worker what happen when government fail in their most basic duty keep their country safe of course fund this increase in defence spending through the aid budget be painful and say to those in the international development community in this country and elsewhere that and other feel the pain give the scale of external threat we should all understand that further painful decision of different kind may come in the future end by pay tribute to the ukrainian refugee meet in kirkcaldy in my constituency few week ago we owe it to those refugee and to all who have fight for ukraine the uk and europe freedom to now do whatever it take to defend our share freedom and security thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure the debate although do not know about the image will have forever of he bake pizza in the snow rise today in support of the people of ukraine they have see their nation invade and devastate by bombing their child kidnap their mother and sister rap and many of their home hospital and school completely destroy in leicester like in the rest of this country we have tradition of stand up for the oppressed the bully and the underdog during world war two raf leicester east now leicester airport be home to the us airborne division which play major role in day and the liberation of europe from the nazis britain have show its compassion since russia invade ukraine three year ago as the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage articulate perfectly the british people have stand firmly and resolutely beside the ukrainian people and one reason for that be our nation tradition of stand up for the underdog russia invade ukraine in the belief that ukraine be weak and vulnerable and that it would roll over and play dead while putin take its land identity and resource what he discover be that ukraine be an underdog that bite back and the british people have wholeheartedly identify with its bulldog spirit the ukrainian people have win our heart and our loyalty their determination to fight on and to protect their home their family and their culture have be painful to watch but any nation that can so effectively fight putin military might deserve our unwavering support and the support of our suppose ally what may be even hard to watch in the come month and year be the uk and other european country have taste of what many small country have experience for generation new world order where the large power decide to redraw the map or steal mineral and other natural resource at the stroke of pen with the small country face menacing threat of much bad if they do not comply new world order where those who pardon insurrectionist who try to overturn the result of democratic election and who to this day do not accept the result of the us election have the cheek to lecture long stand european country on the imperfect nature of their democracy our country must stand against this new gangster world dominate by few bro in ivory or even gold tower who trade the world small nation between themselves like property on monopoly board that be why despite ukraine troubled past its fight be our fight and we must work with our european partner to ensure it win regardless of the threat from washington moscow pyongyang or even beijing who would have think that the future president of those brave soldier of the airborne division station in leicester would align himself with today equivalent fascist rather than with the nation and people who fight to defeat that particular evil when ukraine win the new world order that the few gangster bro be try to establish will fail that be why support ukraine be so important and why european democracy have to step up and ensure they win thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure the debate he speak powerfully and passionately and with knowledge imperialism be violent and tragic divide community separate family and lead to untold death and destruction that have be the grim reality for the ukrainian people for the last three year witness it at first hand in march when travel to the ukrainian border with romania

community and those who have gather in recent day to pay tribute to the ukrainian people in place include bishop stortford and sawbridgeworth it be powerful reminder that in hertford and stortford as across the country we stand firmly with the ukrainian people in their time of need the ukrainian people stand resolutely against russian aggression and brutality and our support for they must be unwavering now be the time to redouble our support for ukraine successive british government have lead on this the define moral issue of our time and our solidarity with ukraine bridge political divide in the house it be right that the prime minister now lead the international call for ukrainian sovereignty long term secure future for its people and meaningful seat at the table in any future negotiation nothing about ukraine without ukraine welcome the landmark year partnership with ukraine to deepen security tie and build an endure partnership for future generation and the action that the government be take to step up and speed up our support for ukraine at this critical moment however in world that be more insecure and more unstable than at any time in recent decade it be right that we do more to strengthen our security at home and right that the prime minister have announce an increase in defence spending to of gdp by april recognise that this decision come with difficult but necessary sacrifice and hope that in the come year the government will chart course towards restore spending on international aid as soon as fiscal circumstance allow alongside increase defence spending their first priority however must be to safeguard the british people at home in the face of what be once in generation moment for the world and warmly welcome the prime minister announcement this week finally wish to put on record my admiration for the spirit and bravery of the ukrainian people who have endure so much and will no doubt endure more not just since but over the course of many year of unacceptable russian aggression for those ukrainian family who have find safety in our community hope for future when they be free to choose to return to rebuild home in peaceful secure ukraine or if they wish to remain in hertford and stortford where they will always always be welcome commend and thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for set the scene so well and for his passion for this subject in all the year have know he in the chamber he have be here much long than he have always be stalwart and thank he for that think we all owe he debt do not much like bully and putin be clearly bully now that there be big boy in the playground with president trump of the united states enter the play putin seem prepared to make change and the rule be change of course that be to be welcome but have real and abide concern that memory will be deliberately short have real concern that as we strive for peace as we should we will minimise the atrocity that the people of ukraine have suffer over these three year and that can not be allow to happen my mind be immediately draw to bucha and while have no desire to stir up anger and anguish we need to ensure that we remember who and what we be deal with and why it be essential that our support for ukraine be as unwavere today during any brokerage of peace as it be during those first few day of war human rights watch researcher who work in bucha between and april just day after russian force withdraw from the area find extensive evidence of summary execution other unlawful killing enforce disappearance and torture all of which would constitute war crime and potential crime against humanity those who sanction this behaviour be those with whom we deal now and this must remain in our mind we need accountability so that those who carry out atrocity will be make responsible for their brutality girl as young as eight and woman as old as have be rap and abuse russian crime against humanity must be take to the international criminal court which must make those responsible accountable in whatever way it can if only the death penalty be still in place would certainly seek that for they in northern ireland we deal with the bare face of evil for too many year we see hatred overcome basic humanity as mother and child be blow to piece in fish shop on saturday afternoon by irish republican terrorist no cause can justify that we see the face of evil when people be burn alive with napalm like substance in the la mon restaurant in my constituency we see the face of evil when people be massacre in church all that remind very much of the atrocity suffer by the people of ukraine as look back on the last three year live through those thing in my lifetime and they remain with it grieve that that face of evil be still at work and that such atrocity and disregard for human life for woman and child have be replicate in ukraine they be replicate in bucha as woman and child be murder in february the body of ukrainian orthodox priest be find in the street of kalanchak in russian occupy kherson accord to his bishop russian military force have torture fr stepan to death that be the russians and they must be hold accountable for their brutality we hear of such evil deed be repeat throughout ukraine again my intention be not to drag up these matter in order to cease the striving for peace believe that peace be need but also believe that accountability be need and that while we work for peace we can not allow the trauma of this war to fade into insignificance these crime matter and those family deserve not to be forget my thought now on the third anniversary of this dreadful war be as they ever be that we stand with ukraine that we must fulfil our moral duty to they in war or indeed in peace and that there must be no doubt that the hand of friendship of this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland remain firmly extended to those family in ukraine at this time and in all the day ahead pile of dark brown mud next to hole in the ground hole frame by plank of wood cover tightly in smooth matt black sheeting four rough wooden handle jam in as the mud harden around they with invisible silver shovel bury beneath pile of mud and four shovel in the sharp harsh dry cold of lviv that be the image that have have in my mind for every wake minute of every day since saturday morning it be the picture of newly dig grave in the cemetery of hero in lviv ukraine as mention early by my hon friend the member for southend west and leigh david burton sampson for that image encapsulate the four day trip from which and other mp from across the house return early this week it might sound an unusual thing to say but this graveside be not simply one of sorrow nor just of pride nor just of memory it be one of defiance and resolve that image encapsulate for the emotion of all of the people of ukraine they have take the punishment dish out by criminal dictator bully for three year they have not only withstand the daily bombardment but thrive underneath their air defence umbrella in position where every day represent struggle for survival to the next ukraine have be able not only to fight and reach the next day but to plan for prosperous future in health education technology cyber security the scaling of innovation and in culture the ukrainian people be shape their long term future even as they take to shelter every night this be not just keep calm and carry on this be keep calm win the present and build the future the ukrainian people want peace of course they do but they will not accept peace at any price we ask over and over again what message do you want we to deliver back to our country and our parliament the answer be always this something so simple and obvious that it be hard to believe it have to be restate russia have conduct an unprovoked invasion of ukraine russia be the aggressor ukraine the victim we have have year of warning from the murder of alexander litvinenko in to the first invasion of ukraine and the public poisoning in salisbury and then finally the full scale invasion of our ally do my hon friend agree that russia past behaviour with putin seem to sign up to agreement but then not follow they be precisely why security guarantee for ukraine future be so important could not agree more grow up in berlin during the cold war and could hear russian artillery and helicopter practise on live firing range so that have always be present since be very young we must not misunderstand the gravity of this moment geopolitical stability and security will be the defining issue for this generation and this parliament it be incumbent on we to do whatever it take to keep british people safe at home and abroad and to support our ally that be why fully welcome and endorse the decision this week by the prime minister on defence spending increase however as argue in this house in december and even should be see as floor for our defence spending not the ceiling this government have already take one difficult decision and there may well be more to take in the future suspect that before long the government may conclude that they must go even far or fast or both if they do so they will have my full and total support that be not to crave the spending it be to accept the reality of the world we live in not the world as we would wish it to be while the public clearly support the increase spending on defence it be incumbent on all of we in the house to ensure that the reality of the danger and threat that this country face be bring home as be the fact that this might mean even tough decision very soon while war in ukraine might feel abstract as see over the past few day that war can very quickly come to these shore and in variety of way the mission of all side of this house be to maintain that unity and communicate that reality and to bring the public with we on long term journey that will be difficult with the year partnership agreement sign by this government we have the foundation of long term relationship with country with which we share so much and with which we be stand shoulder to shoulder on that foundation we can build last peace want to end with quote by jfk in the same speech in which he call for peace not merely in our time but peace for all time he say there be no single simple key to this peace no grand or magic formula genuine peace must be the product of many nation the sum of many act ukraine have take several of those many act and the uk be one of the many nation it be incumbent on we to continue act until we find the peace we all seek ukraine be country that never seek war as we speak today in this house people who be once administrator chef and mechanic be sacrifice their life on the frontline to protect their home and family it have be privilege to be in the chamber today to hear some of the speech from hon member who have be in ukraine over the last week and have tell their story so powerfully thank they for do that the people of ukraine have over the past three year defy the odd at every turn and have president unmatched in his bravery president zelensky look down smartphone in february star down putin war machine and pledge to defend the right of his sovereign country to exist and the right of his people to be free he have do so ever since successive prime ministers have stand at the dispatch box and be absolutely right to offer british military and financial aid the fight to protect ukraine be fight for democracy and for our share value for three year this cause have bind together europe the united kingdom and the united states but there be no doubt that we have reach crossroad moment in time that will shape the future of ukraine and europe on february the vice president of the united states make his keynote address at the munich security conference he say the threat that worry the most about vis vis europe be not russia what worry about be the threat from within the retreat of europe from some of its most fundamental value it be very sad and serious spectacle us vice president seem to downplay the significance of putin aggression in europe aggression that as we have hear today have lead to the death of hundred of thousand of people with million more drive from their home if his primary concern really be freedom of speech and expression he would do well to look close to home just this week journalist from reuters and huffington post be deny access to the first cabinet meeting of the new us administration what worry about be an agenda that claim to champion free speech but be actually seek to promote favourable speech those be two very different concept the word of the vice president serve as confirmation that period of us history be end the republican party of eisenhower and reagan be sleep it may well wake again in time but for now it lie dormant in kyiv brussels paris berlin and here in london we have to respond to the world as it now be peace deal fully support by the united states and ukraine and europe must of course remain the central objective and our prime minister be absolutely right to pursue it however as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith tell the house deal can not just mean the absence of war peace be what the people of ukraine deserve but we must never countenance settlement that be not agree to by president zelensky return to munich there be one sentence in the speech of vice president vance that could endorse to believe in democracy be to understand that each of our citizen have wisdom and have voice on that he be right our citizen do have wisdom in the united kingdom they have the wisdom to look to the history of our continent and see the danger of fail to stand up to aggressor until it be too late they know that now be the time to make our voice hear and to say loudly and in unison that we stand with ukraine thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure the debate and for his bravery in go as far as kharkiv admire his work and advocacy associate myself with everything that hon member have say especially about the bravery of the man and woman of ukraine who be stand up to putin every day and fight not just for their own freedom but for our freedom my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell and have just come back from week in ukraine where we have an opportunity to speak to number of mps ministers industry leader and those in civil society will focus remark on the need for drone technology which be paramount to we win in ukraine as many hon member have say we face an existential crisis the increase in defence spending to of gdp be important but it be vital that we get beyond that to and more from my trip last week and from my previous visit it be clear that putin be not go to stop at ukraine border if ukraine fall then nato country and baltic country in particular be in the firing line it be important that our constituent understand that this war be not about other people it be war about we as well turn to drone technology in meeting with deputy defence minister sergiy boyev be tell ukraine need fleet of drone that possess the same characteristic as the kalashnikov what he mean by that as be reflect back to by the chair of the ukrainian economic affairs committee dmytro natalukha mp who know other hon member have meet be that ukraine need something like kalashnikov fly kalashnikov if you will because it be standard issue easy to manufacture reliant on available common part and comparatively cheap such technology alone will not match the existential crisis we all face but it could play vital role in the war however in order to get such technology the drone sector need to be able to access uk capital we need more joint venture between our defence company in the uk and ukrainian defence company want to underline why these drone be so important there be now many different type of drone there be massive drone like the one the iranians be unfortunately supply to putin force such as the shahed drone when be in ukraine spend some time in bunker because at one point there be shahe drone overhead there be also drone that be necessary to hold ukrainian position and to help the ukrainians to advance as the security adviser and expert james rushton whom have the opportunity to meet while be in ukraine tell small recon drone such as the dji mavic be the difference between an entire platoon of ukrainian troop survive or not they can help the ukrainians to know if the russians be come over the horizon so they can get away in good time the converse be true as they can also help the ukrainians to hold position and to advance it be important that we get to place where we be able to provide more capital to ukrainian company to help they with the part they need and collectively with european ally to help they produce some standard and cheap type of drone as they will be vital in the war thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith and other for secure the debate of which be proud to be co sponsor many excellent and learn point have be make there have be real show of unity from the house and we can all be proud of the debate today three year ago peace be break the world wake up to something we hop we would never see again full scale war in our backyard russian tank be roll into europe across ukraine border missile be light up the sky and the fire of war rip through home there be complete and utter destruction of harmony and innocence with people grab whatever they could and flee for their life russian force have brutally invade their sovereign neighbour putin the dictator think this would be over in week yet because of the tenacity fight bravery and leadership of ukraine and zelensky here we be three year on today ukraine be still fight and not just for its land but for its survival it have be say many time before but will say it again if russia stop this war be over if ukraine stop it lose everything so today before anything else we pause to honour those who have pay the high price the parent who have bury their child the soldier who kiss their love one goodbye not know if they would ever return and the civilian who once live in peaceful village now reduce to rubble million have be displace hundred of thousand have be kill and school and hospital have be destroy in target ballistic missile strike among other act of terror and war people have endure torture execution and sexual violence they have have their child snatch and send to russia and there have be horror that we in britain would struggle even to imagine never mind put into word yet despite all that the flame of hope for free nation ukraine not just stand but fight and refuse to surrender or be footnote in the history of the brutal expansionism of that barbaric mad tyrant in moscow we all like to think that in that scenario we would do the same and that we would kiss our love one goodbye and fight for our country our family and our way of life ukrainians have be do that now for three year through smoke rubble and fire and attack after attack they have stand up and say to putin not we not ukraine it be in honour of that bravery spirit and flame of hope that we must proclaim to not an inch of ukraine be russia entitle not metre of ukraine belong to russia not mile of ukraine be in russia sphere of influence by divine right that air that soil those people and those child be ukrainian we stand with they today and every day for democracy for freedom for sovereignty for decency and for the world that we want to believe in no surrender no appeasement no deal without ukraine at the table we will stand with ukraine for as long as it take slava ukraini thank the member of the backbench business committee and the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for grant and lead the debate three year ago we watch as missile rain down on ukraine from kharkiv to lviv damage even the holocaust memorial at babyn yar anyone who have stand in that space will share the sense of revulsion at that desecration motorised column report to be some mile long advanced on kyiv and its advance group leave horror of murder in their wake this be the terrible return of unrestricted industrial warfare to europe for the first time since the goal must be state bluntly the russian state seek the destruction of ukrainian sovereignty and ukrainian national identity the proof of that assertion can be find in body that be lay out in izium bucha and kherson and fear in many other place whose name be not know to we and that only liberation will identify when we think back to february we must remember the hope that could quickly be find among the despair small ukrainian force defeat the russians at hostomel airport and on such fine margin the nation may have be save the action of successive uk governments and the unity of this house have as many other hon member have say be essential to that ukrainian struggle for liberty out of war have come new bond of family and friendship pay tribute to the member of the british armed force who have train ukrainians and to the royal centre for defence medicine in birmingham they have learn from we and as be say early we have learn from they also pay tribute to all those who have act as host as part of the wide support network for ukrainian refugee one of the most valuable thing we can do in this place be repeat ukrainian voice will quote one that of ivanna khrapko the youth chair of the federation of trade unions of ukraine who it have be my pleasure to come to know over the last couple of year ahead of tuc vote some month ago she say of course we want peace more than anything but we want just peace without occupier in our country as oleksandra matviichuk the head of the centre for civil liberties in ukraine which hold nobel peace prize say peace can not be reach by country under attack lay down its arm that would not be peace but occupation hope that message so eloquently articulate by ukrainians who know the russian regime well than anyone be hear by all those currently make decision about ukraine future can not go into detail in the very short amount of time available but the issue identify by the hon member for chichester jess fuller with regard to the ukraine permission extension scheme have be hear in my constituency as well and hope that minister be monitor those concern closely close by echo one last ukrainian voice that of taras shevchenko who write in poem almost year ago also under russian occupation oh bury then rise you up and break your heavy chain and water with the tyrant blood the freedom you have gain and in the great new family the family of the free with softly speak kindly word remember also the word ring true today if one message be to go from this house today hope it be this our nation support for the ukrainian cause be constant not pass we remember ukraine and we will stand with ukraine and with our ukrainian friend to the end to the very end and to the hop for day as hard as the path may now be to imagine when all ukraine will be free in the short period of time have will say this we face critical moment for our nation for europe and for the world now be the time to uphold our value and to encourage our ally to do the same that mean concrete step here and now to protect and defend ukraine as well as last agreement to ensure its security into the future while this feel like dark phase for european security it be not the first time that we who believe in co operation and the importance of alliance have have to argue the case with those who favour more transactional zero sum approach to international relation we must hearten ourselves that we have win the argument before include with our american friend and we must appeal to the noble instinct of that great nation we be now at hinge in history perhaps the most dangerous one since the cold war because at stake be not just the erasure of nation but the weakening of the international rule base system and the transatlantic military alliance that have in combination underpin european security since world war two even the concept of truth be be challenge but will not rehearse those point we all know that there be truth and we must defend it we must not allow great power to trade ukraine future like pawn in game of chess because at stake be the principle that bully must not prosper in our world if they do other nation will be next indeed the former british prime minister whose bust sit in the oval office once say an appeaser be one who feed crocodile hop it will eat he last the baltic state understand that strongly welcome the leadership that the prime minister have show in reassert our value and our commitment to increase defence spending and contemplate put peacekeeping troop on the ground we must defend the right of any country to defend itself against invasion by its neighbour but ukraine be not just any country it be beacon for those who value freedom in its bravery and sacrifice it be uphold the concept of not just its own but every nation sovereignty it be defend the international rule base system international law freedom democracy human right and yes we we must remind our friend around the world that intelligent self interest and uphold moral value be synonymous if we do that ukraine will live on the rule base system will live on and ultimately world that value and defend freedom and democracy against those who threaten they will live on call the liberal democrat spokesperson while welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate it be one that we all hop we would never have to have but thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure it for more than three year the brave people of ukraine have heroically defend their country against full scale invasion defy putin expectation and show the world their courage resilience and unwavere determination they have remind we all of what be at stake the right of sovereign nation to choose its destiny free from coercion and tyranny today we be at pivotal moment with our prime minister in the us this be moment that will determine the future of our continent for generation to come now more than ever we must stand firmly in support of our ukrainian friend resist trump dangerous flirtation with deal that reward russian aggression and work with our european ally to defend freedom and democracy the uk must act decisively that start with work with our european ally to unleash the billion worth of russian asset currently sit idle in bank in order to give ukraine critical boost at this critical moment the un general assembly have recognise russia obligation to make reparation for this illegal war yet history show we that russia will never voluntarily pay those reparation by redirect these fund to ukraine we be not undermine the rule of law but uphold it some fear that seize those asset set dangerous precedent argue the opposite it set necessary precedent it tell the world that the international community will act decisively against those who wage unprovoked war of aggression it be only right that those asset be repurpose for military aid humanitarian support and rebuild effort any negotiation about ukraine security must involve ukraine itself this war be about ukraine sovereignty and its fate can not be decide in backroom deal between washington and moscow cautiously welcome report that the white house be engage respectfully with kyiv but this commitment must extend beyond word there can be no ceasefire or security negotiation without ukraine at the table anything less would be an insult to the sacrifice make by its people and betrayal of the value we claim to uphold support ukraine mean more than military aid alone it require long term investment in defence manufacturing joint procurement with ukrainian company and recognition that ukraine innovation in defence technology robotic artificial intelligence and prosthetic be unparalleled globally the uk should actively support and invest in those sector help to strengthen ukraine economy while also bolster our own security and technological capability we must also stand with ukrainian veteran and refugee more than ukrainians now call the uk home and many of those who arrive here in will soon need to apply for visa extension under the ukraine permission extension scheme while that scheme grant those ukrainians an month extension it provide no certainty about their long term future we must ensure that ukrainians in the uk have clarity about their right to remain while understand that so many of they will return to their country once the war be over if the us retreat from its role in global security europe must step up and britain should lead the government pledge to raise defence spending to of gdp by be welcome and we hope it will mean reversal of the conservative party short sighted cut of troop but we must go far give the increasingly volatile global landscape the uk need to plan to far increase defence spending now be not the time to play politic the government should recognise this and host cross party talk to discuss pathway to as soon as possible however we must fund this increase defence spending in the right way at time when ukraine economy have contract by nearly and its reconstruction need be estimate at nearly billion it be incomprehensible that the uk have choose to cut its international aid budget to fund the increase in defence slash funding for global development while increase defence spending be like rob peter to pay paul the uk soft power be vital tool in this fight and we must restore our aid budget to of gross national income ensure that our support for ukraine do not come at the cost of abandon other vulnerable nation defence after all be base on defence diplomacy and development the liberal democrats have set out how an increase in defence spending could be fairly fund by increase taxis on social medium firm and other tech giant but the government have choose to finance it by cut the international aid budget this be dangerous mistake weaken the uk global influence will only play into the hand of russia and china we must also lead discussion about the creation of european rearmament bank lead by the uk and other like minded european nato ally such bank would allow we to collectively increase defence spending far and fast by raise additional private capital that model would mean more stable long term financing system enable the defence industry to innovate and increase production capacity the question be not whether we act but what happen if we do not fail to stand with ukraine will embolden putin undermine nato and threaten european security three year into this war the stake could not be high we must take bold action to stand up for democracy for our ally in ukraine and eastern europe and for our own security call the shadow minister it be an honour to have the opportunity to mark the grim milestone that be the third anniversary of putin illegal invasion of ukraine be grateful to the backbench business committee for call this debate and pay tribute to all the brilliant speech we have hear from member on both side of the house particularly my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith above all though pay tribute to the people of ukraine without any provocation whatsoever ukraine have suffer vast casualty and national trauma beyond our wild imagining all force on it by an aggressive dictator and bully if we ask ourselves why this war have happen surely lord acton have the explanation when he famously say back in power tend to corrupt and absolute power corrupt absolutely there be reason why putin can murder on our street threaten nuclear war harass our maritime and airspace invade free nation do away with his political opponent and care not jot for casualty rate in his own force of more than day it be because he be not constrain by the check and balance of democracy that hold he to account he have absolute power and he have use it destructively regardless of the impact on his own people let alone the people of ukraine putin motive be the motive of so many despot and dictator down the century power lust and hunger for conquest he externalise his nation problem which his corrupt oligarchy can never solve and that ultimately lead to internal economic hardship and pain for all bar he and his close elite be incredibly proud of the support that we give in government to ukraine we provide the weapon to help it avoid an early capitulation which would have be truly disastrous for ukraine and the free world in opposition we have continue to stand resolutely with ukraine support the labour government to that end as they support we prior to the july election we wish the prime minister every success in washington and hope for last peace in which ukraine can finally enjoy the security it deserve for all the talk of peace and for all our effort to date provide everything from tank to storm shadow missile and despite the incredible bravery of ukraine armed force in defy the odd to push back putin land and naval force the day to day reality in ukraine be one of continue bombing pain and suffering for its people key question for we in this debate be what action can we undertake this day to support the ongoing fight turn to the subject of drone and rearmament which be raise by the hon member for hemel hempstead david taylor in an excellent speech but one aspect of rearmament speak to our own need to rearm also ukraine will need rearmament on far great scale whether settlement be achieve or not if there be no settlement the ongoing war will require that rearmament if there be the need to give ukraine security about its future will also require continued ramping up of military industrial production not least to deter russia so now that the government have confirm their plan for sustained increase in defence spending we must urgently unlock our domestic procurement to drive our defence industrial capacity and that of ukraine on monday have the pleasure of visit brilliant uk defence sme modini which be create one way attack drone and other capability for the british army when launch the mod first ever defence drone strategy about year ago the plan be to procure drone at scale for ukraine as we have do and to learn from that to build domestic industry capable of arm our own military it be frustrating to hear from modini what have hear from so many of our good defence sme which be that procurement be largely on hold en masse our fantastic firm be like coil spring wait for the government to press go on procurement at the scale and pace we have need for month like the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire believe that big step forward would be for our defence company to urgently forge new joint line of production with ukrainian firm in the united kingdom honour the pillar promise in the year partnership to establish strong and close defence cooperation and industrial basis that be so important because for safety reason ukrainian defence company that have speak to want uk production away from the bombing they also know that partnering with uk sme will provide access to capital and ultimately chance to feed into uk procurement for the uk that co operation mean access to the know how and expertise of those company with manufacturing capability that have succeed in war as it be be fight for our armed force and the mod it mean realise the cultural change that we need be less risk averse in procurement and rapidly develop capability to enhance the lethality and survivability of our armed force in the near term that will be particularly important should there be peacekeeping force ultimately conventional war that be sustain for long period be fight in term of factory production capacity which be link to innovation do not agree with the hon member for loughborough dr sandher about capital control think there be enough capital but he make an excellent speech about the need to boost capacity when be the minister for defence procurement look at multilateral procurement with nato partner whatever its current military capability europe have vast industrial base that could scale up if there be the will power to do so and if there be leadership from government we lead at the outset of the war and with our great ally the us reasonably ask we and our nato ally to do more of the heavy lifting in confront the russian threat we will need to lead again that require leadership on industry and innovation in the uk and across europe to massively boost our defence industrial capacity urge the minister to do everything possible to accelerate partnership with ukrainian business that have deliver on the frontline but which will be even strong with british backing that will create british job and will deliver far great scale of production for both country armed force we can and must continue to do everything possible to support ukraine be grateful to the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for initiate this timely debate which it be an honour to close and be grateful for all the superb contribution from member on both side of the house be especially grateful for the powerful advocacy of members who have just return from ukraine they share their experience of what be go on there and tell the story of the brutality of the russian onslaught have be in bomb shelter in kyiv as the air raid siren sound which be sobering experience it stay with you and it must it be reminder of the daily courage of our ukrainian friend as they resist putin illegal invasion today we have have the opportunity to reflect on the most unhappy of anniversary it be three year this week since putin illegal full scale invasion of ukraine three year in which thousand of people have lose their life million of ukrainian family have see their home and community destroy and ukrainian child have be steal by russia although russian troop continue to make small territorial gain both nation have become deadlocke in war of attrition but this be war that putin believe he could win in three day thank to the extraordinary resistance and courage of ukraine russia have be humble on the battlefield three day have turn into three year and today mark day the whole house will recall that when russian tank be bear down on kyiv president zelensky be offer ride out for his own personal safety he famously reply do need ride need ammunition that be churchillian heroism be it all party in this house have rightfully praise president zelensky the democratically elect leader of ukraine it be right that we continue to stand with he and his people for as long as it take will come on to that in my remark putin resource have be drastically wear down with over russian soldier kill or wound the uk government expect the grim milestone of million russian casualty to be achieve in the come month nearly main battle tank and armoured vehicle have be lose and the damage and destruction of the once formidable black sea fleet be testament to what nation without navy can now do with the right equipment and approach let we not forget that over these three year the uk have often be the first to step up to help ukraine this year we will spend billion on military assistance more than ever before to date the uk have provide billion of support and train over ukrainian personnel with our ally as part of operation interflex and we have commit to billion year in military support for as long as it take we have continue to strengthen ukraine in recent week early this month we announce new million firepower package include drone tank and air defence system on monday the defence secretary announce that we be double our support for ukraine lifesave defence medical service with million uplift in funding for project renovator the uk have be repair and upgrade military rehabilitation hospital in ukraine and provide training to ukrainian surgeon doctor and nurse and the funding will provide major boost for this project it will help ukrainian soldier to recover from frontline service and help those who have suffer life change injury while defend ukraine sovereignty we also hear on monday from the home secretary that we be turn the table on putin by block russian elite and oligarch from enter the uk and the foreign secretary announce the large package of sanction since the early day of the conflict which aim to hit russia revenue and hamper vladimir putin military machine stand alongside our ally we will do what be necessary to support ukraine and keep europe and britain safe the uk be solidify our historic year partnership with ukraine sign by the prime minister and president zelensky in kyiv in january bolster co operation on defence and security and more and importantly signal our confidence that in year time there will still be free and sovereign ukraine turn to some of the important question that have be raise in today debate on negotiation while russia be weaken it remain significant military threat not just to ukraine but to the whole of europe and the united kingdom ukraine be the frontline of freedom and our defence and security begin on that frontline in eastern ukraine that be why the decision make in negotiation over the come week and month will define not only the outcome of this conflict but the shape of european and global security for decade to come everyone want this war to end none more than the ukrainian people who need chance to rebuild their shattered nation so the effort by president trump administration to find solution to the crisis be welcome but the result peace can not be achieve at any price that would be an insult to ukraine the armed force of which continue to fight with enormous courage and skill and the population of which continue to ensure unimaginable hardship when the fighting stop it must be follow by strong stable durable last peace that mean deal that safeguard ukraine sovereignty and end russian aggression not temporary ceasefire before putin find an excuse to return to violence but lasting and durable peace an insecure peace risk more war and us backstop be the only way to achieve durable and last peace the government position be clear negotiation about ukraine can not happen without ukraine at the same time it be right that the uk and europe play our part in secure the peace it be our security that be be negotiate as well as ukraine we have to work together with the us to achieve sustained peace and protect the democracy that both the us and europe hold so dear that be why the prime minister have say that us security guarantee in ukraine be critical to stop putin attack again it be welcome that we be now talk about negotiation but as defence minister let remind the house that we must not jeopardise the peace by forget about the war president trump have long express his wish for europe to step up and take more responsibility for its own security and he be right indeed we be respond to that challenge and we be step up early this week the prime minister announce the big sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war we be bring forward our labour manifesto commitment to spend of gdp on defence to back to level that have not be achieve since when labour be last in government ahead of his visit to washington today the prime minister also announce that subject to our economic and fiscal condition and align with our strategic and operational need we will set clear ambition for defence spending to rise to in the next parliament through our strategic defence review which will be publish in the spring we be assess the threat that britain face and build the defence capability we need to meet they we be also cut waste in the ministry of defence and reform procurement and recruitment include by address some of the outdated medical standard that have be raise in this debate we be prioritise investment in uk defence industry as result our armed force will once again become fit to fight modern war learn the lesson from ukraine and adapt to the evolve threat we face because we know that strengthen defence be the only way to win peace by deter conflict but also by prevent defeat in it if necessary we be also step up in nato and encourage all our nato ally to spend at least on defence with britain spend on defence from we be also set new benchmark for other to follow two week ago be lead uk trade delegation in ukraine with our dutch and norwegian colleague we talk about more joint venture more investment more tech transfer of knowledge and data sharing in both direction this week visit finland latvia lithuania denmark and the netherlands to discuss with our close ally how we step up our collective support for ukraine the

so thank you on their behalf this have be an excellent debate it will send message of unity to the president of america it will tell he that this house be unite in its support for ukraine and believe that if we have faith in ukraine it will succeed and that there be no peace that be not durable that be worth the word peace we need to make sure it have freedom and justice at the same time to finish the debate will give one small quote if the house will forgive it be very short from the man who in be also appeal to the president of nation of million that be in isolation and not likely to enter war on our behalf this be the sign that we must send to the man who have bust of churchill sit in his office this be how churchill appeal to the president of america and on behalf of ukraine repeat it put your confidence in we give we your faith and your blessing and under providence all will be well we shall not fail or falter we shall not weaken or tire neither the sudden shock of battle nor the

speak in the annual st david day and welsh affair debate and it be special honour this year to be speak as the member of parliament for the new seat of neath and swansea east have live in swansea east my entire life it be real step into the unknown when the boundary change force to leave behind half of my very special constituency to represent completely new and equally special constituency it may only be minute down the road but those minute bring whole new community much more rural landscape and diverse caseload that differ in many respect from what know before when make my maiden speech in

minute away from the church be neath market traditional cover market that have trade in the same building since as shop have come and go over the year the market have be constant and the produce on sale be in my opinion the good available if shopping list include glamorgan sausage caerphilly cheese dozen welsh cake bunch of daffodil or even bucket hat with dragon on it neath market be the place to go neath really have past to be proud of in addition to the beautiful historical building we also boast one of the old fair in the uk neath great fair which take place every september can be trace back to and not even the first world war could disrupt it with henry studt van even use as recruiting office for the war effort in talk of showman like henry studt yet another outstanding church in the town centre st thomas have close affinity with the showmen guild house wonderful carousel horse and stain glass window that be commission for the guild centenary celebration our modern day neath be no different from anywhere else across the country with its once bustling town centre feel the effect of the convenience and value of online shopping know many constituent be understandably devastate when marks and spencer close nine month ago after decade of be the town anchor store unfortunately with very little support from the rainbow independent plaid coalition local authority we be very lucky to still have selection of national chain and individual bespoke shop still trade and thriving personally be very big fan of shop locally as it mean can pop into the castle hotel for cup of coffee at this point must give special mention to miss jones boutique mossies and coco blush any time hon member see stand here it be almost certain that be wear something from one of those shop like everyone else in our great country my constituent in neath be truly patriotic bunch hon member will struggle to find man woman or child who be not vehemently proud to be welsh proud of our country of our history and of those who represent our nation back in july at the very start of this parliament the leader of the house join in wish good luck to team gb in the paris olympics and particularly to dan jervis from resolven who be head to paris as part of the gb swim team mention dan again today as early this month he retire from competitive swimming congratulate he on all he achieve and thank he

to bring that programme to young people who otherwise might not have be able to access it tobe heartsafe be set up by sam richards in memory of her son toby it have always be my desire to help people

quite rightly there be heavy demand to speak in the debate if member can help each other by keep their remark to about four minute will be able to get everyone in it be pleasure to contribute to this debate mark st david day and to celebrate the rich culture history and contribution of wales to our shared union my constituency of chester south and eddisbury share part of its western border with north wales and the tie between we run deep many of my constituent cross the border daily for work school and appointment and to visit family and friend in fact wales be particularly close to my heart because my mother be bear in swansea our past relationship with wales however have not always be as cordial and amicable henry prince of wales who would go on to become henry be name earl of chester in september he use his power over the city of chester to order that all welsh people and welsh sympathiser should be expel from the city follow the battle of shrewsbury cause by welsh uprising during the battle henry sustain nasty injury as result of an arrow that lead to he become slightly paranoid about the prospect of further welsh uprising and push he to pass law that say that welshman be not permit to enter chester before sunrise or stay after sunset if he do he would be subject to the penalty of decapitation be relieve to say that law be no long in place as it would certainly put dampener on our tourism industry not to mention my family gathering it also lead to the urban myth that it be legal to shoot welshman with longbow after midnight in chester on sunday so long as he be within the city wall have recently take up archery but let assure the house that it be not with the intention of test the legality of this law despite such moment of strained relation we have always be link by geography trade and share experience chester strategic location make it key military stronghold for the romans the mercians the normans and most notably edward during his conquest of wales thankfully our cross border exchange these day involve much less castle storm and much more co operation in the first and second world war the cheshire regiment fight alongside welsh contingent in some of the most challenging campaign include gallipoli that legacy of co operation and mutual support be something we should celebrate cheshire and north wales share deep connection across multiple area will briefly refer to two of they our shared economy and our shared infrastructure our local economy in cheshire and north wales be very much co dependent our rural economy be support on both side of the border by grower and producer in recent westminster hall debate on agricultural property relief intervene on the hon member for caerfyrddin ann davies to highlight the importance of farming to our economy be strike when she say in response that her farm supply milk to major food producer in my constituency do not know that that coincidence illustrate perfectly how we work to support each other particularly in the rural economy our local economy be deeply interconnect many worker from my constituency commute to industrial site such as airbus in broughton and deeside and many people commute from wales to work in my constituency of course visitor from wales help to drive chester tourism and hospitality sector it go both way many of my constituent enjoy weekend trip to the north welsh coast whether for stroll along llandudno promenade or well earn break on anglesey it be important that we continue to share close economic relationship go forward because both cheshire and wales be net contributor to our respective economy and together we lead the way in innovation and entrepreneurship in so many way strong economy must be support by strong infrastructure which bring to my second point we have great potential for growth in north west england and north wales but often our infrastructure do not meet demand have speak in this house about the need to electrify the trainline between crewe our major rail hub and chester however if we be serious about growth and stimulate our economy the north wales main line should be electrify all the way to holyhead to unlock its full potential road infrastructure be equally vital many of the road that run through my constituency of chester south and eddisbury such as the or the north wales expressway be critical for freight and connectivity particularly those link the port of holyhead to liverpool and manchester yet some road include the be not suit to the volume and type of traffic that they now carry when heavy good vehicle pass through village such as clotton and duddon where home and duddon st peter church of england primary school sit right on the road it be clear that improvement must be make hope that the government will in partnership with their welsh counterpart continue to build on the positive momentum put in place by the previous government on deliver the transport upgrade that both side of the border need as st david day approach the future of wales as part of the united kingdom be bright and exciting it be wonderful to hear that my hon friend have new string to her bow she make the point about the many way in which we be connected and share heritage across the country we be celebrate st david day and we all have our own local saint and national saint but be it not marvellous that ultimately we all come together as one nation the united kingdom and that more unite we than divide we my hon friend make critical point all part of our union be important our relationship with wales be one of share history share prosperity and occasionally friendly sporting rivalry of course our affection may be briefly set aside for minute when england travel to cardiff for the six nations in couple of week time but be confident that our friendship will survive even another english victory wales remain an integral part of the united kingdom and our deep tie economic cultural and personal will only continue to grow let we celebrate that today and work together to ensure that both side of the border thrive in the year ahead diolch yn fawr and happy st david day to all call jessica morden diolch madam deputy speaker wish everyone happy st david day for saturday as always it be pleasure to have the opportunity to speak in the chamber about our wonderful city of newport

this new industrial revolution with the environment at its heart protect our unique natural surrounding at the centre of all this sit our city port as the uk large steel port it be lead the way in become port of the future with an ambitious plan by associated british ports to decarbonise that will not only sustain the port long term viability and provide source of renewable energy for the city

light of us tariff the strategy also need to address the persistent issue of energy cost and procurement and an update from the secretary of state on any conversation with the cabinet about steel would be most welcome as in the last industrial revolution when newport be key to get black gold to the world the city be once again essential to the industry of tomorrow without all the vital component wafer data centre for hyperscaler semiconductor manufacturing equipment and renewable energy capacity the uk risk miss out on this ai and data drive industrial revolution with support for

mindedness that come with support these club that be so valuable for our community should have send my hon friend my speech beforehand because will come to that agree that non league club bring more than economic value to their community united have be at the forefront of mental health and wellbeing campaign many volunteer have go on to work in the game and have become accredited coach or have simply build up the confidence to get back into pay work after lengthy absence recently attend walk football event at the valley stadium it be hearten to see more senior player who be still active and that those who have suffer from poor mental health feel that they have an outlet and community to be proud of football be tool to create partnership that local government and national government

valley be also home to the west bromwich albion lady team despite that incredible work and the proven benefit for the economy and the community the challenge face local non league club be significant it be get hard not easy for non league club to be sustainable and their contribution be at risk limited revenue stream mean that non league club often face financial struggle they may struggle to maintain infrastructure pay player and compete with large club sometimes promotion can mean be place in geographically challenging league which make it difficult to attract player and in some case relegation follow promotion last night have the chance to speak with ellis platten the creator of the awaydays youtube channel who have do an excellent job of chronicle the impact of local club hit tough time not just on fan base but on community it have chronicle everything from durham city unwanted winless run to farsley celtic play home game mile away from its home ground such story be not uncommon when ownership fail ten per cent of the team that be in redditch united league last year no long exist the economic footprint and social impact of those club have be immediately lose and there be nothing to replace they no billionaire be interested in rescue small club so non league team simply collapse as with the loss of major high street retailer the knock on impact on the local economy can be catastrophic it be not just the economic benefit that be lose all the work do off the pitch at the heart of our community be lose too if redditch united be to shut its door we would lose so much more than team despite the excellent work of the football foundation to support club such as redditch united and to improve local football facility the balance between be community asset and maintain financial sustainability can be challenge for such club and too many town be lose they usually when mention football in the chamber it be in reference to grimsby town but on this occasion will mention brigg town fc which be now in my constituency thank to boundary change it be community interest club go to one of its match few week ago the hon gentleman and other member have draw attention to the important role that such club play in the local community in order to secure finance they encourage local business into sponsorship do he agree that that be vital source of income for non league club the hon gentleman be absolutely right redditch united would not be in existence if it be not for the support of local business in redditch and the village we be extremely appreciative of their sponsorship and if some of they be watch this we hope that they renew their sponsorship agreement for the next month trickle down economic simply do not work in the football pyramid and not simply in cash term it can be difficult for non league club to approach council for support when it come to planning or to ask council to involve they in long term strategic economic health and leisure decision making many transport route that serve local ground have be lose and while premier league and championship club might receive significant support in make their ground accessible the same do not apply to many non league club due to lack of fund and expertise in town hall thank my hon friend for give we the opportunity to talk about our local non league football club such as northfield town fc and alvechurch fc pay tribute to they for their community work do he agree that many club face challenge in find funding to bring on more woman and girl team and to invest in the infrastructure the same apply to disability team that can be barrier to access wide funding believe he know both football club well do he share my hope that they will find that investment thank my hon friend for his contribution as goalkeeper let in many goal by northfield town fc so have make my contribution to his constituency he be absolutely right have the fortune to bring the chairman of redditch united david faulkner to the houses to parliament to meet the chairman of the fa we make it clear that there be not the money available at the moment to build the infrastructure and facility for girl and woman and it be prevent participation so we must do more to build that infrastructure and those facility in our community non league football club be ideally place to support this government commitment to the growth and regeneration of our town centre build transport network fit for purpose improve skill and education and critically reduce the burden on our nhs by promote sporting participation the economic impact of non league football club be multifacete they contribute to local employment business revenue and social programme while their financial reach be small than their premier and football league rival their influence significantly shape local economy and foster community cohesion and pride redditch have player but only of they be on the man first team football club be more than what happen on saturday afternoon we need to talk about club not just team as the impact of club such as redditch united be more than just their place in the football pyramid when they be lose the benefit to our economy and society be lose too not every non league club have ryan reynolds or rob mcelhenney and accompany tv show wish they have because if we have learn anything from the wrexham story it be that when football club have the mean to be successful it can rejuvenate town success breed confidence and pride people start smile and the money and investment follow not just into the football club but throughout the city and regional infrastructure congratulate my hon friend on secure such an important debate celebrate the immense value of football and our local club commend the mention of woman and girl use to play football myself for team want to talk about tamworth fc my local chairman contact about the campaign which be push for an extra promotional place from the national league to the english football league that would provide more ambition for club provide inspiration for fan and crucially ensure that money flow from the top right through the game to our low non league club do my hon friend agree that we need to support initiative like that to ensure that club and local economy benefit football be about competition more relegation and more promotion be good thing for so certainly endorse tamworth support of the campaign although have focus on redditch united and be proud of what the club be do on and off the pitch know that the excellent work it do despite extreme challenge be be repeat up and down the country by staff and volunteer they be not ask for handout just for the respect and support they deserve while welcome this government and this minister commitment to deliver the football governance bill hope that when the bill be pass the government will be able to work with the football association local authority and non league club to review the sustainability and resilience of non league football and crucially opportunity for growth via our non league club such review into the financial sustainability governance and gap in support for non league club at step and below would allow we to recognise what support they need and how we can finally ensure that the rich of our game make it down to the real grassroot there be more we can do with local authority to ensure that transport link support the growth of club and encourage more fan to attend we can help local authority to recognise local club importance and provide guidance on strategic planning include the benefit of work alongside club in meeting leisure education and economic priority finally and crucially we need to offer the same governance support to non league club their fan basis and their community to ensure that we reduce the number of club force to drop down division or fold because they do not have the liquidity to continue their operation at the high level secure the future and prosperity of non league club could benefit many minister sit around the cabinet table be unashamedly passionate football fan but my passion for non league football and my team redditch united be not just about what happen on the pitch for minute non league football club be often the unsung hero of our local economy as have explain they not only put million into our economy but provide job be the base for critical educational and social programme help people back into work and provide sporting facility enable thousand of boy and girl every week to stay fit and healthy hope that during this parliament we will be able to investigate how we can use the tool available to the house to support they the local

seek and be in receipt of public and national lottery funding any governance concern regard non league club should be raise with the fa which have its own complaint procedure sport england oversee the
