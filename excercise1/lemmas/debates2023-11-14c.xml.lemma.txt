than high in cash term than it be in the secretary of state for work and pensions be undertake his review at the moment and can not pre empt that now that lord cameron have return to the cabinet it be probably good time for we to remember that the pension triple lock be liberal democrat initiative the liberal democrat manifesto say we will uprate the state pension annually by whichever be the high of growth in earning growth in price or per cent give that the triple lock have now be operational for more than decade will the chancellor and his team commit to put the triple lock in the next manifesto nice try the triple lock be conservative invention deliver by the conservatives and it be something to which we remain committed welcome my hon friend to her new role give that it be right that we look after our pensioner and ensure that people be well look after in late life it be important that we have the right tax base to fund our pension will she meet to consider way in which we can make our taxation system more family friendly to encourage more people to have more child and to ensure that we can pay for our pension in the year ahead my right hon friend be brilliant advocate on these issue and of course would be delighted to meet he food inflation what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of trend in the level of food inflation what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of trend in the level of food inflation what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of trend in the level of food inflation uk food inflation have be drive largely by global factor and have already fall from to and external forecast expect it to continue to fall between march and april the cost of first infant formula increase by on average with the cheap formula on the market increase by that be an absolute catastrophe for family who rely on infant formula but bonanza for the formula company which be make significant profit out of this can the chancellor tell why he believe it be right for company to profit while family struggle to feed their baby the hon lady be absolutely right to draw attention to the pressure on family cause by very high food inflation in number of area but can tell she that the competition and markets authority which undertake review of the grocery sector early this year have not yet find evidence that high food price inflation be be drive by weak competition but it be continue its review and look at the supply chain and we will wait to hear what it say recent research show that the most significant decline in uk child height in the global ranking come after the uk coalition government launch their austerity programme in an expert in child growth rate at the great ormond street institute of child health say of that place drop in rank that austerity have clobber the height of child in the uk what lesson have the chancellor learn from the uk government previous disastrous error of judgment in this area and how will he be support vulnerable group in the future the lesson have learn be straightforward if we have not reduce the deficit by between and the start of the pandemic we would not have be able to help family across the united kingdom with payment of more than on average include household in scotland and more than million pensioner even if the inflation rate be fall food price be still go up considerably the joseph rowntree foundation reckon that they have go up at least twice as fast as the value of benefit since september at the very least can the chancellor commit to ensure that the department for work and pensions have enough resource to raise benefit at least in line with september inflation rate the secretary of state for work and pensions be do his review at the moment to decide the correct amount by which to uprate benefit if the hon gentleman look at this government record he will see that we take the decision year ago to uprate benefit by inflation and we commit to billion of measure to help family get through the cost of living crisis food inflation will only get bad if our self sufficiency in food production drop will my right hon friend consider fiscal measure to discourage the transfer of food produce land to other us such as solar industrial installation my hon friend be right to say that our food industry be very important to food security we need to keep the priority constantly under review nature be very important part of that but so too be food production call the snp spokesperson it be good to be address an elect minister this morning the consumer organisation which have describe tesco and sainsbury as commit dodgy practice over food price and loyalty scheme and marks spencer have just post record profit on food sale yet people up and down the nation of the uk be struggle to pay their food bill will the chancellor tell we which supermarket he have hold to account over rise food price can tell the hon gentleman that we have the supermarket in over the summer to make sure that they be do everything they could to bear down on food price inflation however the correct way for politician to look at this be at arm length we have the independent competition and markets authority which do rigorous job and often do thing that politician disagree with and it be look at the issue right now in canada ministers meet the five large grocery chain to get commitment on stabilise food price other government be do similar thing france finance minister hold extensive talk with the food industry to get it to commit to freeze or cut price on everyday product be it not the case that for people face crush food bill in scotland and across the nation of the uk this westminster government be do absolutely nothing think billion of support to help family up and down the country include with food price and energy price be rather different answer from say that we be do nothing energy sector what fiscal step his department be take to support the growth of the energy sector since march the government have commit total of billion in public investment for the green industrial revolution since then the chancellor have announce billion for clean heat and improve energy efficiency and billion for carbon capture usage and storage alongside the launch of great british nuclear and the small modular reactor competition the government have also invest billion in sizewell accord to recent survey of north sea oil and gas operator have reduce spending since the energy profit levy be introduce therefore welcome recent announcement on new north sea licence and the announcement before the summer of the energy security investment mechanism by which the epl will be remove when appropriate can my hon friend tell when we can expect response to the consultation on the esim and what plan this government have to legislate for the mechanism will he meet to discuss how investor confidence in our home grow industry can be assure far introduce the price floor for the oil and gas industry come from the principle that while it be right that oil and gas company pay high share of tax during exceptional time it be also right that when price fall to normal level so do their tax rate that be why we introduce the price floor in june and we have extensively engage with the industry since then know that legislating will provide some certainty we be look carefully at that and will respond soon will always be happy to meet with my hon friend the labour party and the co operative party have set out shared ambition for more community own energy that be not new in denmark of wind energy be community own and in germany half of all onshore wind be community own will the government do far more to join that ambition of community own energy here in britain we have ambitious plan for energy generation and our energy security we want to bring community with we and we look at all option as we do so wealth tax what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of introduce wealth tax of course the uk do not have single wealth tax but it do have several taxis on wealth and asset and those generate substantial revenue the government be commit to keep taxis low so that work people keep more of what they earn the government approach to deliver fiscal sustainability be underpin by fairness with those on the high income pay large share but the burden of tax be increasingly fall on work people income while the rich family in the uk have alone accumulate combine wealth equivalent to that of half the population research from the university of greenwich show that wealth tax could generate billion for much need public service so will the government at least put forward commission to investigate the matter and introduce fair taxation policy be not sure whether the hon lady be lobby or opposition front benchers with her comment but she will be well aware that we do have progressive tax system in the uk it be important to remember that the top of taxpayer be project to pay nearly half of all income tax in and the top as much as compare with what we inherit from labour in when the top of income tax payer pay and the top pay the tax system be fair and more progressive under the conservatives those who live in home with driveway pay just vat when they charge their car from their home electricity but those who live in terrace house have to pay vat to charge commercially give that those who live in terrace house be often less wealthy will the minister whom congratulate on his new role meet and other member of the conservative environment network to look at how we might level out that anomaly my right hon friend be great champion of such issue in her constituency and beyond be aware that she have already speak to the chancellor about this issue but would be delighted as always to meet she and discuss it far the government have do lot to raise personal allowance for which our party have advocate for many year however give that that be an improvement for people at the bottom end of the income scale will the treasury now turn its view towards hard work middle income family who also want reduction in their tax burden we appreciate the support for take million of the lowest pay people out of pay income tax altogether since an important and significant change understand the hon gentleman comment but can not comment far especially this close to fiscal event welcome my hon friend to his new post do he share with the humour that opposition back benchers have proposal for new taxation that the opposition front benchers be try to bat away while those of we on the government back benches be tell the government to cut taxis and our front benchers keep bat that away thank my hon friend for his comment be afraid that what we be probably see be same old have hear this all before what they be propose do not work in the and it will not work now we be very proud of our tax record particularly take the low pay out of income tax call the shadow minister welcome the minister to his place the government have the opportunity next week to right an historical wrong by abolish non dom tax status the chancellor could use that money to get our nhs back on its foot and to provide free breakfast club for all primary age child just as labour have call for be the abolition of non dom tax status under consideration or have the prime minister rule it out again for personal reason the hon gentleman be well aware that there be real danger that what he be propose would make the uk less attractive destination that be very important issue the city pay for huge amount of our nhs for example and non dom taxpayer be liable to pay billion in uk income tax in and invest more than billion in the uk benefit uprating if he will have discussion with the secretary of state for work and pensions on the potential merit of uprating benefit in line with inflation the government be commit to support household with the cost of living deliver over billion of support include uprating benefit by this year as have say the secretary of state for work and pensions be undertake his review and can not pre empt that figure from the trussell trust show that food bank usage be at its high ever level and over the summer month record parcel of food be provide to child in scotland alone meanwhile child poverty cost the government billion per year in poor health and educational outcome in order to tackle child poverty properly will the government commit to keep benefit in line with inflation and lift the two child cap we understand that thing be really tough at the moment which be why we have put in place of cost of live support this year but we also all need to work on bear down on inflation we be see it start to come down but we know it be still too high and we hope we will reach the prime minister pledge of halve inflation because that be the big help we can give to household this year defence sector investment what step his department be take to help mitigate the potential impact of environmental social and governance practice of

ensure that each region of the united kingdom but especially northern ireland can benefit from defence spending for the workforce we can do the job the same as everywhere else we just need the

back the loan thank my hon friend for his question the most important thing we can do be bear down on inflation because that will bear down on interest rate which affect we all would also point to the cost of live support that the department for education be provide for student would be happy to discuss the matter with he far economic growth what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the economic growth rate our policy be increase economic growth as the office for budget responsibility confirm follow last year autumn statement and the spring budget but the only way to secure high sustainable long term growth be to bring down inflation the obr judge the chancellor last budget to have no overall long term impact on the level of potential productivity do he

slowly for quite so long it might help the hon gentleman if tell he some of the fact on infrastructure since we make some reform to the asset pool framework in uk and global infrastructure investment by pension fund have grow from billion to around billion and the solvency reform could potentially unlock furth billion worth of investment that mr speaker be list of very slow decision still be badly take the labour party have raft of plan available to help drive economic growth and investment in every corner of our country from speed up the grid to accelerate planning for critically important infrastructure today be make they available to the chancellor for free would he like they or would he rather call general election unfortunately nothing be free from the labour party funding plan by increase borrowing by billion year lead to high bill for family high energy price and high mortgage pension scheme investment what step his department be take to encourage pension scheme to invest in the uk what step his department be take to encourage pension scheme to invest in the uk while we be bask in those question would somebody like to answer they in my speech at mansion house in july

competitive business investment taxis be very proud in the spring budget to introduce full expensing for three year which give we some of the most competitive business taxis in the oecd only five other country do that and will of course keep under review any possibility to extend that tax break be investment not need in the uk give that year of tory rule have result in billion uk deficit meanwhile independent ireland have billion surplus from its economic growth and investment that be an ireland without the oil or natural resource of scotland which be now about to start sovereign wealth fund where do the fail crisis hit uk go wrong and independent ireland go right the clue by the way be in the question find that very curious question if the hon member be proud of scotland natural resource why do he want to cancel north sea oil and gas exploration which be the very thing that can give family across the united kingdom security from the energy shock we have see from thing such as the invasion of ukraine there be encourage news in that the pension insurance corporation have recently announce that it be go to invest in help to support the building of new affordable home in this city do the chancellor agree that pension fund could be very important source of capital for develop social rent housing around the country eden housing association south lakes housing and westmorland and furness council for example will he look at the rule and bring in great incentive for pension investment fund to invest in affordable housing across the country we be already work on proposal in that very area broadly speak we have one of the most robust and resilient pension fund sector in the world but we be do lot of work to remove the barrier to invest back into the uk thing such as affordable housing infrastructure and our growth business be area of great potential public sector productivity and public spending what step his department be take to increase public sector productivity what step he be take to help ensure value for money in public spending my hon friend be rightly very focused on make sure that every single pound of taxpayer money be spend wisely and can assure he that the government share that goal in june the previous chief secretary to the treasury launch the public sector productivity programme and we will provide an update at the autumn statement estimate show that the public sector today be less productive than in the environment just before covid do the minister agree that this could possibly be down to continue more liberal work from home ethic how much be this cost the taxpayer my hon friend be right that public sector productivity must be improve that be exactly what the review be look at and what we will address look forward to talk to he more about it in due course welcome the fact that the taxpayer have spend hundred of million of pound on remediation work at the teesworks site in redcar do not welcome the fact that the asset include of the operate company and ten of million of pound of scrap have be hand over by the tees valley mayor to two private company whose owner be laugh all the way to the bank be that really good value for taxpayer money think these claim have be address by the mayor and will not have anything furth to say about they fuel poverty what fiscal step he be take with cabinet colleague to help support household in fuel poverty the government have take significant action to help household with rise energy price and the cost of live by provide one of the large package of support in europe total billion orkney and shetland have the bad rate of fuel poverty of anywhere in the country provisional figure show that for last winter both orkney and shetland record record level of winter mortality in his new office will the minister bring his colleague together from across government to hear from agency such as thaw tackle household affordable warmth in orkney that be work to tackle fuel poverty because if we can tackle fuel poverty in orkney and shetland we can tackle fuel poverty we be incredibly sympathetic to the right hon gentleman constituent who have suffer very difficult time that be why we introduce the energy price guarantee which will remain in place until march as safety net we continue to engage with lot of stakeholder and we be very happy to include the one he suggest mortgage support what step his department be take to support homeowner with their mortgage what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of change in mortgage interest rate over the course of this parliament on household income the path to low mortgage rate as everybody in this house know be through low inflation which be why the prime minister and the chancellor make halve inflation one of our five priority for this year the late bank of england forecast show that we be on track for that in june lender represent more than of the mortgage market agree to our new mortgage charter which include new flexibility to help customer manage their repayment back up by uk finance advertising campaign encourage anyone worried about their repayment to contact their lender do the minister agree that the good way we can help the next generation of homeowner be to increase the supply of home bring back the help to buy isa and stop the year mortgage share ownership model which only increase house price thank my hon friend for his question on his first point we be increase the number of home and we be optimistic that we will reach our target of deliver million new home over this parliament secondly the help to buy isa be close to new account in but exist holder can continue to save into their account on his third point about stop year mortgage it be important to have choice in the market and for people to make those choice for themselves as government we be commit to support people do just that accord to the centre for economics and business research mortgage increase be expect to cost uk household billion this year and next how on earth do the government defend that as the hon member know the reason why we be in this position be that there be global phenomenon we be do what we can we be work closely with the bank of england and over time due to the policy of the chancellor the prime minister and this government interest rate will come down welcome the hon member for mid worcestershire nigel huddleston to his post as financial secretary it have be year since the conservatives crash the economy in so far million fix term mortgage have expire leave work people face sky high increase in their mortgage cost for people live in wellingborough for example this tory mortgage penalty mean that household be pay another month on top of everything else in cost of living crisis the truth be that work people be pay the price for the conservatives crash the economy last autumn do the economic secretary think that be fair thank the shadow minister for his kind word at least in relation to it be important to recognise that in the eurozone the united states and the uk there have be broadly similar increase in inflation and interest rate we as government be confident that our policy will bring those down in due course cost of living scotland whether he have have recent discussion with the secretary of state for scotland on the impact of increase in the cost of live on the scottish economy we have announce uk wide support for household include cost of living payment the energy price guarantee and the energy bill support scheme take together support for household be worth billion and be among the large package in europe the institute for fiscal studies recently report that wage in scotland have rise by since compare with in england in the face of cost of living crisis bring about by the conservative party disastrous mini budget wage simply be not keep up with the cost of living what can the minister commit the government to do next to help make work pay will she for example support labour new deal for work people be pleased to see this morning figure which show that wage be go ahead of inflation this be very good news and hope it spread to scotland non domicile resident tax status whether he plan to change the tax status of non domicile resident in the uk the government want the uk to have fair and internationally competitive tax system design to bring in talented individual and investment that contribute to the growth of the uk economy non domicile individual play an important role in fund our public service through their taxation contribution and they pay uk tax on their uk source income and gain in the same way as everybody else the non dom tax status allow people to dodge million in taxis germany france and canada have close their non dom tax loophole can the minister explain to taxpayer in plymouth and across the country why he think it be fair that people who live here do not pay their taxis here as say in the answer give some moment ago non dom taxpayer make significant contribution to uk tax worth billion in with billion more invest the city for example pay half the cost of the nhs mortgage interest rates what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of trend in the level of mortgage interest rate the government mortgage charter be provide support to vulnerable household and arrear and repossession remain at historic low government support have help real household income rise by year on year in the late datum with the economy flatlining and interest rate remain at and more than likely to remain above next year it simply follow that household disposable income will continue to be squeeze throughout surely the chancellor agree that mortgage interest tax relief must be reintroduce to support household face high interest rate alongside inflation as the hon member have already hear from the chancellor the economy be still grow the late labour market datum show that income be go up at high rate than inflation so do not recognise the picture that he paint household finances what assessment he have make of the financial position of household during winter the government continue to stand by household with one of europe large support package amount to some household on average across and the minister will be aware that big concern for rural constituency be the cost of fuel the rac have find that the margin enjoy by the big supermarket on fuel sale in october be double the figure for the year to date at per litre that reflect concern raise by the competition and markets authority that although wholesale fuel price fall in september and october retail price do not what be the treasury assessment of the impact that these high margin will have on household in the come winter fuel duty be major cost for household and business we recognise that that be why in the spring budget the chancellor extend the temporary duty cut that be billion saving for motorist worth for the average motorist but we always keep these thing under review economic growth essex what step he be take to support economic growth in essex as my right hon friend know the government be commit to support economic growth all over the country but particularly in the wonderful county of essex the recently announce billion long term plan for town will for example provide million of flexible funding over year to clacton and there be many other measure welcome my hon friend to his new role hope that he will know not only that the only way be essex but that essex be net contributor to the treasury we want more economic growth in essex in week time we will have the autumn statement so may give message to those on the treasury front bench may appeal to the chancellor in particular to look at lower the rate of personal and business taxation particularly the area of business rate corporation tax and all aspect to do with enable people to keep more of the money they earn my right hon friend tempt to make tax policy what will say to she be that she will know that the chancellor always keep these thing under review as do the government indeed we have fiscal event shortly can ask the minister why he say he want particularly to support investment and growth in sussex interruption be that the tories revert to type in term of the blue wall order think it be essex not sussex they be all the same to have you get question do not think an answer be need life sciences sector what fiscal step he be take to support the growth of the life science sector life science be one of the chancellor key growth priority area in may he announce significant new policy package back by more than million of funding reaffirm the government commitment to support thriving life science industry thank my hon friend for that answer life science be incredibly important so will he focus investment on they in project such as bioyorkshire on the edge of my constituency which bring together private public and academic institution for huge benefit right across the board my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the benefit and importance of life science to the country we be genuinely world leader be out in boston in the united states see the other world lead area for life science and it be not patch on our that be why as an example we be look to support life science through the investment zone programme but as say they be key priority for the chancellor as part of his growth agenda topical questions if he

of september hmrc compliance effort on support scheme which start when the scheme be set up in spring have prevent the payment of or recover the overpayment of more than billion of grant thank the

my hon friend expertise in this area which be of great benefit to the house and to as consider fiscal measure as we be so close to the autumn statement would say that the way that we treat cost in our investment and pension fund industry be not optimal and we need to reform it short time after the former chief secretary to the treasury the right hon member for salisbury john glen say he be alarmed by the amount of tax people be pay he be out of job be he sack for highlight the government tax burden the high for year my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen do an excellent job and we all salute his brilliant work if he be here now he would remind the hon gentleman that we have the low tax burden of any european country in the know that the chancellor be aware of just how important the whisky industry be to the economy of rural scotland it be very disappointing that the policy of duty freeze be not continue in the budget can he offer any reassurance that we will return to the policy of duty freeze in the autumn statement and in next year budget we be incredibly supportive of the scotch whisky industry in fact the scotch whisky association be my first meeting in post in nine out of previous fiscal event we either cut or froze duty on whisky and we have act to remove punitive tariff on scotch whisky in the us market it will not be surprise to my right hon friend that all taxis remain under review and he will not have long to wait until the next fiscal event bank be take advantage of high interest rate to make bumper profit new poll show that people have have enough with big support for one off windfall tax on bank profit yet the government have choose to slash the surcharge on bank profit be it not time for windfall tax on excess bank profit to help people who be hit hard by this crisis there be two thing would say in response to that first it be important when we talk about bank that we have globally broadly competitive tax regime and we do not apologise for that in the treasury secondly the hon gentleman should bear in mind that the reduction he talk about in term of the levy on bank be offset by rise corporation tax thank the exchequer secretary to the treasury my hon friend the member for grantham and stamford gareth davies for his recent visit to darlington where he open new branch of darlington building society he will know from that visit the impact that treasury job be have locally include an additional million of spending in our local economy do he agree with that darlington economic campus be fantastic levelling up

unregulated buy now pay later sector the labour party have set out plan for urgent regulation of the sector can the minister confirm when the government will do the same this be complicated area of regulation and we be look at it very closely the consultation close in april and we be work on it because it be very important we get it right but hear the hon lady concern and will update the house in due course while the shadow chancellor be busy scroll through wikipedia to copy and paste the actual chancellor have to look no far than the new conservatives tax plan which outline scrap the reform increase the vat registration threshold to and deliver on the prime minister pledge when he be chancellor to bring cut in income tax in thank my hon friend for add to the litany of option have in front of for the autumn statement what can say to he be what say in my party conference speech we be commit to lower the tax burden and will do so as soon as it be responsible to do so some of people in chester have mortgage and they be still bear the burden of the government disastrous mini budget they deserve peace of mind that mortgage rate will come down soon so what be the chancellor go to do about it can say gently to the hon lady that interest rate have go up by in the uk since then that be just above the united states and just below the eurozone so this be global phenomenon there be no short cut to bring down interest rate we have to support the bank of england as it bear down on inflation and then we can bring mortgage rate down will the chancellor look at the red tape around the apprenticeship levy many business in my area such as asda amazon and dpd all say that they want to take on more apprenticeship but that the red tape around how they spend the money be very difficult this be something that he could change overnight and really help to grow and boost our economy thank my hon friend for draw attention to the apprenticeship levy which have be tremendous success in bring rigour to technical qualification that be not there before we be very open to reform to the apprenticeship levy provide they stick to the fundamental principle that any investment be not in in house training that would otherwise have happen but in transferrable passport able training that someone can take with they if they move to another business the nhs dental plan have be stick in the treasury for month while my constituent be wait year to see an nhs dentist when the chancellor make his autumn statement will he also release the dental plan with the funding that be require so that we can get dental treatment back on track for our constituent will not pre empt what be go to say next week but will say to the hon lady that as former health secretary be well aware of the pressure on nhs dentistry and its importance to all our constituent give that inheritance tax be the least popular of all taxis at every income decile and that scrap it would not be inflationary will my right hon friend consider do so that be very nice try but my hon friend will have to wait for week opt out saving be little like auto enrolment in pension they help those on low income to save for crisis for the proverbial rainy day give that more than million people in this country be in work with no saving at all will the chancellor note the impressive result of small trial of the opt out saving system in manchester and encourage its expansion would be happy to do that the hon gentleman be right if we be to grow fast as an economy the other side of the coin be we that need to save more and we should be encourage everyone in all income group to do so will my right hon friend seek to fix the anomaly that see man make fully synthetic fuel tax at the same rate as their fossil equivalent shall be happy to look into that issue in detail and get back to my hon friend yesterday in the house in the context of labour plan for health service the secretary of state for work and pensions refer to the poor old non dom do the chancellor agree with his colleague that people who live in this country but do not pay their taxis here can be accurately describe as poor because we attract wealth creator from all over the world and this may be uncomfortable for those on the opposition benches we generate huge amount of tax revenue financial service pay for half the cost of run the nhs be in favour of get everyone to pay their fair share of tax but will not make reform that mean less tax revenue for the nhs call david linden to ask the final question the westminster make cost of living crisis be have devastating impact on household income particularly in broomhouse where many young homeowner be see mortgage price soar will the chancellor use the autumn statement to introduce mortgage interest tax relief to help people across glasgow to deal with the cost of living crisis as the hon gentleman know we have take enormous step over the past year to help family throughout scotland to deal with cost of living pressure if he really think that people in scotland believe that this be make in westminster problem when we have experience an invasion of ukraine and global pandemic simply say to he in return that after year of snp rule gdp per head in scotland be low productivity be fall employment be low and inactivity be member need to give good reason not to bring they in at the end again be careful let we come to the angus you find the door think in minute israel and the occupied palestinian territories with permission mr speaker will begin by respond to your helpful statement yesterday the foreign secretary the business manager and all believe it be essential that this house properly scrutinise the work of the foreign office especially as we face such daunting set of challenge across the world as minister of state will follow the precedent set by successive government of different party from the day of lord home and lord carrington to more recent time when lord mandelson serve in the cabinet from the house of lords will deputise for the foreign secretary in this house make regular statement like today and respect the primacy of this house in the normal way and of course the foreign secretary will appear before the house of lords and relevant committees regularly the terrible event in israel and gaza have underline the critical importance of british diplomacy and development work as israel battle to defeat hamas the humanitarian situation remain extremely difficult as the prime minister say last night israel must respect international humanitarian law with service and communication in gaza under unprecedented strain it be difficult to be absolutely certain about how event be unfold but the report we have have from partner make clear the appalling loss of life include among child and aid worker and the situation in hospital in gaza city notably al shifa be now acute al shifa have hundred of in patient and be able to offer set of service unavailable elsewhere in gaza report indicate that operation have stop due to the lack of fuel and supply and that premature baby have die due to the lack of electricity fuel be urgently need to power hospital as well as desalinisation plant to ensure access to clean water hospital should be place of safety able to treat patient with compassion it be distress to see they unable to do so every civilian death be heartbreaking and it be impossible to comprehend the pain and loss that innocent palestinians be endure as the house know since october the government have be engage intensively with our close ally and partner in the region since my last update to the house have meet in birmingham on sunday representative of islamic relief who still have humanitarian supply in gaza to hear clearly from they about the situation on the ground and this morning speak to martin griffiths the head of the united nations office for the co ordination of humanitarian affairs will travel to the region overnight tonight the new foreign secretary have discuss the situation with us secretary of state tony blinken the government will be able to draw on his extensive regional experience in the week and month ahead our goal remain unchanged as tell the house last week we be focus on get life save aid to those in need in gaza support the safe return of hostage and british national back israel right to self defence and prevent dangerous regional escalation our effort have contribute to some delivery of aid via the rafah crossing and to over british national be able to leave gaza safely since speak to the house last week more british national and their family have leave and we will continue to offer all the support we can to those british national still in gaza so that they too can cross into egypt as the house know we have more than double our aid to civilian in gaza commit million and we stand ready to do more for over week british flight carry aid have be land in egypt with shipment include life save item as well as the vital equipment that the egyptian red crescent need to be able to manage donation from across the world effectively we be also urge the israeli government to increase humanitarian access include through rafah and by open up the kerem shalom crossing at this point we assess that land presently offer the most viable and safe way to get humanitarian aid into gaza in the quantity need but we be also consider air and maritime option include through our basis in cyprus the government have be clear that all party to conflict must afford civilian the protection that be their right under international law that include respect the sanctity of hospital so that doctor can continue to care for the sick and injure event on october and hamas subsequent statement have make it clear that they be terrorist group who pose an existential threat to the very idea of an israeli state israel have right to defend itself against this terrorist threat to restore its security and to bring the hostage home but there be thing that israel must do as part of its response we have impress this on the israeli government they must act within international law they must take every precaution to minimise civilian casualty limit attack to military target and they must stop extremist settler violence in the west bank at the same time we should be under no illusion hamas have choose to embed themselves within the civilian population and their willingness to sacrifice innocent palestinians in this way only bring home their inhumanity alleviate the suffering be our foremost priority we welcome any initiative that would allow more aid to be deliver and hostage to be release we have therefore consistently call for humanitarian pause four hour pause in northern gaza be an important first step but long pause that cover wide area will be need we be discuss with the un and other partner how good to achieve this we must avoid measure that serve only to benefit hamas and allow they to entrench their position at the same time we need all party to the conflict to abide by any pause allow sufficient time and security for civilian to move and for aid to be deliver respond to the immediate crisis be critical but we also need to do more to create new political horizon the whole house know that only one answer have come close to create peace in these troubled land two state solution commend this statement to the house call the shadow foreign secretary thank the minister for advance sight of his statement would have like to have start by welcome the new foreign secretary to his place but can not do so because he be not here despite my respect for the minister he be not the foreign secretary we do not know when or how this house will hear from the foreign secretary because he be not member interruption order mr seely be you go to be quiet yes right in which case the shadow foreign secretary may continue david cameron be the seventh foreign secretary in seven year of tory chaos he be force to resign in failure over matter of foreign policy the prime minister have look at each of the conservative members and decide that none of they would be well at represent britain interest on the world stage the prime minister claim he be for change but instead he have resurrect yesterday failure with an honour that decision raise serious question for this house but know you share those concern mr speaker at time of grave international crisis and at moment of war in europe with more assertive china climate emergency and horrify conflict in gaza this house need government accountability more than ever will the minister commit to work closely with mr speaker to ensure that the opposition and all member of parliament can hold the foreign secretary to account turn to the horror of gaza more than palestinians have reportedly be kill with two third of the dead be woman and child this be shocking and devastating every civilian death be an equal tragedy do the minister agree that the number of palestinian civilian and child who have be kill over the past month be intolerable and do he agree that israel must make change to how it be fight this war by take urgent and concrete step to protect civilian life be gravely concern by the desperate report from hospital in northern gaza these hospital be already overstretch with the wounded short of fuel and fill with civilian seek shelter doctor be now force to make impossible choice as they try to care for the wounded and newborn without power some of those newborn have now lose their life unbearable medical establishment have special protection under international law they should never be target or use as shield all party must follow international law act with necessity distinction proportionality and precaution allegation of breach should always be treat with the utmost seriousness the minister say last week that the government support the independence of the international criminal court as do the labour party but he fail to answer whether the government recognise its jurisdiction to address the conduct of all party in gaza as prime minister boris johnson reject that jurisdiction and attack the court labour recognise the icc jurisdiction can the minister clarify his government position today gaza be in humanitarian catastrophe more than million people have be displace and there be desperate shortage of basic essential do the minister agree that the short pause in the north be clearly not enough gazan need aid now they need medicine now they need water now they need food now they need fuel now full comprehensive and immediate humanitarian pause in fighting across the whole of gaza be need now to alleviate palestinian suffering and in order for hamas terrorist to release the hostage hamas state aim be to wipe israel off the map they commit the most brutal attack on jews since the holocaust and now they be use innocent palestinians as human shield would like to register my shock that not every member of this house can say this truth hamas be terrorist we must not give up on the narrow opening that keep the prospect of peace alive that mean prevent escalation condemn violence from settler in the west bank condemn rocket attack on israel from iran proxy in lebanon and elsewhere and create future where gaza be not subject to occupation meanwhile international diplomacy evolve and the fact on the ground be change day to day in relation to both hostage be rescue and hamas capability to carry out attack such as we see on october as the leader of the opposition set out to chatham house we must move to full cessation of fighting as quickly as possible the reality be that neither the long term security of israel nor long term justice for palestine can be deliver by bomb and bullet we must seek path to political process that lead to two state secure israel and an independent palestine thank the right hon gentleman for his comment and perhaps should start by address those about the foreign secretary have former prime minister and party leader as our foreign secretary wherever one sit in this house must be plus they will be able to exert british influence and policy highly effectively overseas and greatly welcome the appointment of lord cameron to the position of foreign secretary as the house will know he be an extremely experienced parliamentarian and have no doubt whatsoever that the house the foreign office and the government will gain enormously from his presence the right hon gentleman ask whether will commit to work closely with you mr speaker and of course there be only one answer to that question that be much reassurance be it laughter in addition will seek to ensure the full possible accountability as you set it out mr speaker the right hon gentleman speak of the scale of death and misery all death of civilian be to be profoundly regret he talk about the scene from the al shifa hospital which will have shock every member of this house he like will be aware that humanitarian worker who place their life in jeopardy to support their fellow human being have lose their life he ask about the icc it be not for to fetter or speak in the place of its chief prosecutor but the right hon gentleman will know that he have speak and will do so again the right hon gentleman call for the hostage to be release and hope that everyone in this house will echo that he say that hamas be terrorist and suggest that some do not recognise that agree with he and hope that every member of the house will make it clear that hamas be terrorist dreadful pogrom take place on october where more jewish people lose their life in day than at any time since the holocaust and that piece of information be fundamental to our appreciation of the event to which he refer call the chair of the foreign affairs committee as of today be inform that no more aid will reach gaza not because it can not get to the rafah crossing or because it be pile up in egypt but because the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees have no fuel leave and so the aid can not be redistribute so although really appreciate the government look at maritime and air effort and crucially at the need to open second aid cross to the west bank there be no point it be futile unless we get the fuel to the un will my right hon friend reassure as to what be be do to change that situation secondly have the foreign office overseas judicial assistance assessment increase since october yes or no my hon friend ask about the position on fuel fuel be desperately need today it be go to run out the united nations have be access dirty fuel but now that be at an end and we be incredibly worried about the situation we be talk to the key american humanitarian intervenor mr satterfield about this we be work diplomatically to do everything we can to make sure that the position on fuel be address as we have be do since last update the house do not catch the first part of my hon friend final question so will write to she on that point call the spokesperson for the scottish national party thank the minister of state for prior sight of his statement but here we be on day one of the new fcdo regime and already we see the absurdity of have foreign secretary who be unable to come to speak in this chamber to elect member at time of grave international crisis the minister be right to highlight the appalling loss of life in gaza particularly among child and aid worker sadly there be little sign of that end soon as the bombardment intensifie he be also right to say that humanitarian crisis be unfold couple of week ago ask the previous secretary of state whether he have be make aware or have reasonable ground to believe that israel have breach international humanitarian law in its response to the atrocity of october he steadfastly refuse to answer that question so ask the minister the same question if he have what representation have he make to the israeli government and what response have he have there can only be political solution to this crisis and one have to be find before the entire region be engulf that be why ceasefire be essential to end the unprecedented level of killing and destruction allow full humanitarian access secure the release of the hostage and find political solution that do not include hamas four hour pause be not the answer can we expect the new foreign secretary to change tack and support our call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire so that there be space for that political solution to be find tomorrow the house should have an opportunity to show its support for ceasefire and every one of my snp colleague will be there to support an immediate ceasefire and would expect labour party member from scotland to be in the lobby with we without justice there can be no peace this horrific cycle of violence will continue and more israeli and palestinian life will be lose the hon gentleman underline the loss of life and the cause of it he know our position on ceasefire it be position share by member on the opposition front bench and he also know the absolute commitment we have to try to drive forward pause they must be safe pause for the delivery of humanitarian relief but he know of our commitment on that the hon gentleman ask about humanitarian law robert mardini the director general of the international committee of the red cross have make clear that gaza hospital treat hundred of wounded people can not be target under any circumstance the hon gentleman will know that the icrc be the guardian of international humanitarian law and the geneva convention and robert mardini have say hospital be to be absolutely protect at all time finally the hon gentleman make point about political solution draw his attention to my final comment in my statement about how we have to focus on that and on the two state solution and about the need for hope and opportunity to drive forward the politic in this dreadful situation rise order expect to allow question on the statement to run for about an hour but because there be so many of the same member wish to speak in the debate on the king speech hope we can have short question and speedy answer as my right hon friend have say follow the unprovoked slaughter of its citizen israel have right to pursue and destroy the terrorist force it be terrible that the ordinary citizen of gaza be pay the price for this as hamas would have know but even if israel be able to degrade and destroy the hamas force the hamas mindset will remain hamas mindset that be fund and support by iran iran do not want there to be peace between arab state and israel because the iranian regime do not want israel to exist when will the government take firm measure member from across the house have ask when the islamic revolutionary guard corps for example will be proscribe and we have never be give good reason why it be not what be the answer hear what he say about the irgc and know that he have already be in contact with the foreign secretary on exactly that point hope he will accept that we do not carry on running commentary on issue such as proscription but the house and the foreign secretary have hear what he say be still not clear whether the right hon gentleman agree with labour that the icc have jurisdiction over the conduct of all party in gaza if he do then that be very welcome change from the position of prime minister boris johnson will he clarify that repeat what say last week it be not for minister to seek to state where the icc have jurisdiction that be for the chief prosecutor the chief prosecutor have not be silent on this matter and be sure he will continue to express his view whether we like it or not israel will carry on fighting until it have establish control of the area from which it be attack the question that then arise be what happen next if israel simply withdraw hamas will reappear at least one moderate arab state believe that two state solution will have to be impose and police be the government giving thought as to who might carry out that job otherwise the outcome that they want two state solution be wholly impracticable my right hon friend be entirely right about that and entirely right that israel have an absolute right of self defence in this matter on the option to which he allude can assure he that great deal of thought be go on not only in britain but across the region and elsewhere last peace and two state solution be the only way to guarantee dignity and security for both palestinians and israelis hamas terrorist organisation can not be part of that but month after their contemptable attack on israel it be clear that military solution be not work it be not remove hamas and instead we have the humanitarian catastrophe to which the minister refer do he agree that the way to achieve that peace and two state solution be to back political solution with an immediate bilateral ceasefire explicitly contingent on both party adhere to it so that if one party break the ceasefire military operation remain on the table the hon lady be entirely right about the importance of political solution she know the position of the government and members on the opposition front bench on the issue of ceasefire but hope she will draw some comfort from the emphasis on extend pause that we be now see on the politic remind she that the great progress that be make at oslo which bring thing so tantalisingly close take place on the back of the first intifada every right thinking person want to see an end to fighting and durable peace for palestinians and israelis but hamas have make absolutely clear that there will be no such peace so long as the state of israel continue to exist will my right hon friend say bit more about what have be happen at the al shifa hospital and other hospital in gaza have he see the report and the footage circulate of hamas fighter use those hospital as basis for operation put civilian live at risk my right hon friend who know great deal about these matter be correct hamas have make clear that they do not seek ceasefire and indeed seek to repeat the awful event of october as far as the al shifa hospital be concern he like will have see the horrific picture on television last night and refer specifically to the awful effect on baby that be display recently several united nations expert give dire warning to the world state they believe that the palestinian people be at grave risk of genocide and that the time be now run out to prevent such tragedy furthermore they make it clear that israel ally share the responsibility for that and must act now to prevent genocide from take place give those warning will the minister finally stand with of the british public and call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza we will continue to focus on the importance of humanitarian pause but also try to make sure that when the opportunity of pause present itself we be able to get critical humanitarian supply to those in desperate need away from the horror of israel and gaza there be an unfold tragedy on the west bank with the killing of well over get on for palestinians by settler and the israel defence forces in his statement my right hon friend rightly urge israel to provide protection from they if the state of israel decline to do so and the killing continue would he consider the intervention of un peacekeeping force to keep the peace in that part of the world we have condemn the settler violence without qualification on the work of the united nations there will be many opportunity in the future hope and we will neglect none of they share what the minister have say about the humanitarian tragedy that we be witness all the time on our television we must try to unlock process towards peace and the issue of the hostage be key to that what step have he take so far and what further step will be take by the new foreign secretary to ensure that the hostage be bring home really believe that that could unlock the route to peace thank the right hon lady for her comment she have speak movingly and with great expertise and humanity about this situation both on the medium and in the house if she will forgive we can not give running commentary on what we be do to try to recover the hostage hope that she will accept my word that we be do everything across government and internationally to try to get they home as soon as we can the director of the fbi have say that hamas pose the great security risk to the united states and the west since isis decade ago do the minister of state agree with that assessment and what be the government do to work with our international partner to reduce that threat both in the region and here at home the threat of hamas which my right hon friend set out very clearly be undoubtedly true it be part of israel legitimate position that it can exercise its right to self defence and go after the dreadful terrorist who perpetrate that awful act thousand of innocent man woman and child have be kill and thousand more wound in this conflict over the past month as the ground operation and bombing campaign intensifie as encircled hospital run out of power and medicine as baby be leave to die outside their incubator and as more than million palestinians remain trap in never end humanitarian nightmare do the minister agree that the international community must protect civilian if he do why will the government not join in press for an immediate ceasefire to end the bloodshed allow desperately need aid to reach those most in need and create space for meaningful negotiation and peaceful resolution the hon gentleman speak with great passion and eloquence on this matter in the house can do no well than repeat what the prime minister say last night in his speech at mansion house he say that israel must take all possible measure to protect innocent civilian include at hospital my right hon friend and his shadow have speak of hospital have to tell he that there be now video evidence of suicide vest rocket propel grenade motorcycle use to kidnap israelis to gaza nappy and chair with rope to hold hostage be find in the basement of the al rantisi hospital in gaza the hospital be obviously use by hamas as command centre and be believe to have hold israeli hostage do my right hon friend agree that use hospital in this way as place to imprison hostage and keep weapon be an outrageous breach of international law yes gaza be face humanitarian crisis before october the government cut funding to unrwa from million to million the clock be tick hospital be run out of fuel food and water supply be almost deplete and until large scale humanitarian operation be in place many more people will needlessly die will the minister update we on what progress the government have make to secure humanitarian resolution through the un security council we be work night and day for humanitarian access on the subject of support for unrwa we increase aid very substantially as the hon lady know before october since then we have allocate million of humanitarian aid and we will do more if it be require several hundred of my constituent have write to deeply concerned about the loss of civilian life and want the fighting to stop which we all want last week my right hon friend call for israel to take measure to protect civilian say that we need to see israel take such measure but civilian have continue to die especially in hospital please can he double down on that request to israel to take measure to protect civilian mr speaker if may in the meantime in sudan order have ask everybody to be brief so that other people can get in we should not be drive by self centre behaviour my right hon friend make most important humanitarian point and she may rest assure that the government be seize of it france president macron have call for ceasefire join other european nation such as spain norway portugal and ireland as well as the un secretary general secure negotiate ceasefire one that be bind on all side will require huge diplomatic effort so be it not time for our government to add their weight to the push for ceasefire rather than dismiss out of hand proposal that have grow international support the hon member will know that in order to have ceasefire we need both party to agree to it hamas have make it absolutely clear that they be not interested in ceasefire they make it clear that they want to repeat the action of october believe the right position be to press for pause that be the position of the government and of the official opposition understand that just four conservative members have visit israel since october the prime minister the former foreign commonwealth and development secretary my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy and last week when be there do see evidence of humanitarian protection by the idf force also see video and photograph of the thing that happen in some of the kibbutzim and they be quite simply crime against humanity do the minister agree that there be no moral equivalence between hamas and the sovereign independent state of israel yes completely agree with what my hon friend have say he should know that the prime minister and other member of the government have be in continuous contact with prime minister netanyahu include by hold frequent conversation and discussion however have to say that it would be helpful if all those call for israel to protect hospital would also call on hamas to vacate the hospital and stop use civilian as human shield today alon lee green the director of standing together the large cross community organisation in israel post video of soldier in gaza say on the beach in gaza in gush katif safe happy and my friend conquer beit lahia al atatra and sulatin and we move on and we go to conquer the rest of gaza safe happy enjoy the big opportunity of my lifetime love you all and could be happy to be where be do god work alon lee green say what go on in gaza do not only go against the palestinian interest it go also against my people interest the jewish israeli interest also today we have danny danon likud member and former ambassador and ram ben barak yesh atid opposition member say that israel should expel all palestinians from gaza what be we do to restrain the israeli government and commentator we have always make it clear to israel that we be its close possible friend but friend give candid advice and do not always say what people want to hear the british government will continue with believe the strong support of this house to make the right point to the israeli government and we be able to do so because of our extremely close alliance and friendship with they the human misery and death on both side israeli and palestinian be the bad have witness since become member of this house and they will be solve only by long term political solution will my right hon friend with whom totally agree explain what the british government be do in strategic planning to bring about two state solution there be an immense amount of work go on about how we get to the point where we can achieve that as set out in my statement there be no alternative to the two state solution and all interested party should get behind that have dreadful hour labour when give birth to my first child but still consider myself lucky have medicine water electricity and function hospital the woman give birth in gaza do not have those thing there be report of pregnant palestinian woman who have horrific injury from shell and who then have an emergency section perform without electricity know the minister will think that that be unacceptable but what be he actually do to ensure that hospital and pregnant woman be protect by international law we be speak out in every way we can to try to protect vulnerable citizen quote what president joe biden say yesterday in an oval office address he say that al shifa hospital must be protect and that it be my expectation that there will be less intrusive action israel have make it clear that it have clash with hamas nearby but have not fire on the hospital themselves first thank the fcdo for help to rescue group of isle of wight pilgrim who be catch in the holy land at the beginning of this dreadful conflict secondly it be genuine question both side have talk about the importance of protect hospital but what can israel do when those hospital be be use to store ammunition and hold hostage when there be military hq and operational hamas command underneath those hospital and when hamas be deliberately deny those hospital fuel because they would rather broadcast picture of very tiny baby die than try to save they my hon friend speak with great eloquence and passion on this point can do no well than to commend the eloquence of his argument the short pause on their own be first step but they will not address the grave humanitarian crisis unfolding in gaza the damage to water pipeline sewage pipe hospital school and other infrastructure require urgent rebuilding and that will require much long negotiate ceasefire from both side and the release of all hostage do the minister agree that the aid get into gaza be woefully inadequate and that it be simply unacceptable for israel not to lift its atrocious blockade and siege of gaza the hon gentleman be right that get aid into gaza be an absolute top priority that be why we be focus on opening up not only rafah but kerem shalom and try to make sure that we build up store so that when we can get it in we be able to bring support to desperate people very much welcome the statement by the minister and the fact that the government be look at and work with international partner on humanitarian pause and increase humanitarian aid the minister have say that the government welcome any new initiative for way forward may suggest two the united kingdom host the friend of syria international donor conference in london with international partner can the united kingdom look at do that for palestine and gaza link to that with regard to what happen in gaza after hamas be defeat we have talk about the palestinian authority step up but we have not talk about the other scenario the united kingdom chair the trusteeship council at the un along with france which look at transitional arrangement will the government consider that as way forward order colleague have to understand that mr speaker have say very clearly that the statement will end at it be up to colleague whether they choose to allow other colleague to get in we must have short question please my hon friend have make further two thoughtful intervention the government will consider every possible way ahead as soon as the opportunity present itself there be no point in brag about award million of aid if it can not get in to help the civilian in gaza since october only aid truck have be allow in in normal circumstance the number would be close to with fuel run out be this not now collective punishment it be clear that as the minister say four hour pause be not long enough if he will not call for an immediate ceasefire what length of pause in fighting do he think be require to get aid in to gaza to help civilian it be not just humanitarian pause that be the issue but how to distribute vital humanitarian supply safely to people who may be be corral in small space can assure the hon gentleman that as the opportunity present itself we will do everything we can to drive forward those pause and to make they as effective as possible unrwa have announce that it will be unable to collect aid import from egypt today because it do not have the fuel for truck that also mean that water pumping sewage treatment and other essential service will cease have my right hon friend have discussion with the israelis about the plan to get the aid around gaza and about their exit strategy my hon friend be absolutely right that fuel be the most important of many important issue today we continue to lobby and argue with all relevant party for the importance of allow vital fuel for life save purpose into gaza the minister allude to the horrific scene at the weekend of baby die because they can not be in incubator the idf have offer incubator to the hospital but it be not incubator that the hospital need it have incubator it need fuel the un have offer to courier that fuel in for the incubator but the israeli government be not allow that can urge the minister to do everything he can to change that the hon lady will know that israel do offer fuel yesterday but hamas do not allow it to be accept congratulate lord cameron on his appointment as foreign secretary know that he will be well respect in foreign capital however as mr speaker say yesterday there be scrutiny problem for this house of commons many of my constituent care deeply about the israel palestine situation and other issue such as the ongoing negotiation on the future of the british indian ocean territory therefore in order to enhance commons scrutiny will the foreign office commit to the secretary of state come before the foreign affairs committee on the same regular cycle that the foreign secretary would have appear at the dispatch box for fcdo question my hon friend make very good point we be committed to ensure that this house can fully scrutinise everything that the foreign office do and his suggestion about similar pattern of appearance for the foreign secretary before the foreign affairs committee be good one the minister will be aware that president macron the united nations and all the adjoining arab country be call for ceasefire they be call for ceasefire because short humanitarian pause will not end the slaughter do he accept that what the british people and supporter of party on all side of the house want to see be policy that will end the killing end the slaughter and move towards the negotiate settlement that we will have to move to in any case we all want to see the focus back on the political solution which the right hon lady end her comment by extoll draw her attention to the tell argument that have be make and not just by the government but by those on her own front bench about why the humanitarian pause rather than ceasefire be the right approach my right hon friend will know that the house welcome the extra support that have go to gazan civilian but he will also have note today that there would be support for further aid to get there quickly he will know that that aid can only get there and we can only make sure it get to the people who need it rather than to hamas if those humanitarian pause be long than four hour can he say what progress be be make have listen carefully to what he say but can he say when he expect success for long humanitarian pause be afraid that can not give my hon friend timescale of the sort that we would all like to see but we be aware that to achieve humanitarian pause be the start of progress and nothing will deter we from advocate for that on all occasion the minister refer in his statement to the appalling loss of life among child and be pleased that my right hon friend the member for tottenham mr lammy press he on that specifically because so many of my constituent be concerned about it as thing stand will that appalling loss of life not simply carry on what be the government do to bring it to some kind of conclusion the right hon gentleman be right in north gaza all hospital but one be out of service owe to lack of power or damage we be acutely aware of the strain and stress on life that be why as set out in my statement and have argue in some of my response to question from across the house we be do everything we can to advance respect for international humanitarian law and to bring this dreadful conflict to close thank the minister for his statement his acknowledgment that there be humanitarian crisis in gaza and all his effort to get aid into gaza few moment ago in answer to previous question he acknowledge that the us president say he hop to see less intrusive action at the al shifa hospital as patient and staff remain trapped inside and that hospital must be protect for clarity be that also the position of the uk government yes we be extremely concerned that everything should be do to protect life in the way that the president of the united states set out the archbishop of canterbury and the french president be the late leader to call for ceasefire join the head of several un body million of british people nation and many member of this house more than palestinians in gaza have be kill of whom nearly half be child that can not be just can not in all conscience call for anything less than an end to this suffering will the minister pluck up some courage and call for an immediate ceasefire in order to end the humanitarian disaster in gaza the hon gentleman and share the common aim of end the suffering there be nothing between we on that the argument be about how good to achieve it that be why the opposition front benchers and the government have determine that try to promote humanitarian pause be the right way to proceed although nobody want to see the conflict continue do the minister agree that those who call for an immediate ceasefire must initially acknowledge that hamas be terrorist organisation that they start the conflict through their horrific attack on october and that terrorist organisation agree to ceasefire only when it suit their military aim rather than for genuine humanitarian reason my hon friend be wise in point out the reason why the combatant be not seek to achieve ceasefire at this time unrwa have announce that it be no long able to collect aid because it no long have any fuel for its truck we know that half of the hospital in gaza be already close owe to lack of fuel and security that be why and many other believe that ceasefire be vital to ensure that humanitarian aid include fuel can get into gaza what discussion be the minister have with the israeli authority to ensure that healthcare aid and fuel can get into gaza he talk about extended how long would an extended pause be in respect of the hon lady final comment that be what we be seek to negotiate every sinew of the british government be bent towards achieve the humanitarian aim that she set out can tell she that as of the time come to make this statement the al ahli hospital remain the only function hospital in gaza but it do not have blood bank or supply so the situation be every bit as desperate as she and other on both side of the house have set out in addition to the evidence that we have already hear of hamas stockpile weapon and the apparatus of terror in hospital include child hospital the israeli authority have also identify the misappropriation of aid such as oxygen concentrator mean to aerate the tunnel operate by hamas be hide in aid truck be that not all evidence that no matter how much our human instinct want to see an end to bloodshed and the loss of life ceasefire would only embolden the terrorist embolden hamas and the only way to get peace in the middle east be for the total destruction of hamas my hon friend be right the military power of hamas have to be destroy that be what many people believe and that be what the israeli government be intent on do point out to he that the israel defence forces use their power to defend their citizen hamas use their citizen to defend hamas the minister have rightly point out the intolerable human suffering of civilian in gaza but do he accept that it be consequence of the blatant abuse of civilian by hamas who have bomb hospital and use they as basis deny vital aid and locate arm factory in flat where people be live as the terrorist be clearly under pressure they be lose commander basis and control do he agree that now be the wrong time to call for ceasefire which would only allow the terrorist to regroup re arm and prolong the conflict the right hon gentleman speak with authority and understanding of these situation he eloquently explain why ceasefire be not practical opportunity the minister rightly say in his statement hospital should be place of safety able to treat patient with compassion it be distress to see they unable to do so médecins sans frontières have demand as bare minimum medical evacuation of patient what more can the british government do to make that happen as have set out throughout my response and in my statement the british government be do everything we possibly can to advance that humanitarian endeavour clearly the atrocity of hamas will in time be consider war crime but what we be see from the idf at the moment be so far removed from what can be describe as self defence israeli government official have call gazans human animal and reference the use of nuclear weapon on gaza netanyahu himself have cite amalek in the book of samuel which mention kill and slaughter every child animal and person on top of that israeli ministers have hand out machine gun to people in the west bank have not hear moral case let alone logical case from anybody in this house for not join all the arab world the un the archbishop of canterbury and the pope in call for an immediate ceasefire in order to get hostage out and humanitarian aid in the hon gentleman will have hear the argument for and against ceasefire and he will have hear what the government and his own front benchers have say that be where the argument rest at the last fcdo question ask the minister twice about get fuel through to hospital and highlight in particular the plight of woman due to give birth in appalling circumstance their baby be now die appreciate what he say about try to do everything we can to get fuel through to hospital but at what point do we say enough be enough israel will not allow that to happen and what can we do to ensure that those baby life be save it be important not to give up hope it be important to drive forward in every possible way we can the objective that the hon lady and share and we will continue to do that as the minister acknowledge we be all shock by the image of baby be huddle together in the hope of keep they warm enough to stay alive what more will the government do to overcome the problem that the minister refer to in response to my hon friend the members for sunderland central julie elliott and for bristol east kerry mccarthy to ensure that we facilitate the safe delivery of fuel for humanitarian purpose such as keep life save equipment work for people in hospital in gaza the central way to address that point be to try to get fuel through and that be what we be do many of my constituent want to see hon member in this place include those on the labour and tory benches call for ceasefire in gaza with one in local gazan people kill by the israeli war machine how much bad do it have to get before this place prioritise life over death and peace over war the minister say that hamas may not want ceasefire so why do what hamas wish the government must not wait for more people to die before eventually listen to the public my constituent and president macron and make that ceasefire happen the hon member will have hear heavily rehearse during this statement the argument for and against ceasefire and fear can not add anything to what have already say on that point the minister call for israel to follow international law in gaza ring utterly hollow when we know that that be not happen the united nations secretary general amnesty international human rights watch and other have be clear that israel be clearly and grossly violate international humanitarian law since this government have license more than million of arm export to israel include part of stealth aircraft which be currently rain down bomb on gaza do the minister know whether british weapon have be use in violation of international law in gaza and do he agree that we should not sell weapon for commit war crime the hon member will know that the president of israel president herzog have make it clear that his country will abide by international humanitarian law interruption she will also know that in respect of arm export in this country we have the tough arm regulation anywhere in the world what assessment have the minister make of the number of palestinian civilian death that there will be include baby and child without humanitarian ceasefire in the next month would not necessarily trust the figure that be produce by hamas but we do know that an extraordinary number of people have lose their life and we be all try to do everything we can to make sure that we bring this situation to conclusion as rapidly as possible before we talk about humanitarian pause should we not agree first what we want to achieve by they would they not need to be for day or week not just for four hour we need to repair infrastructure and get aid in on scale that be just not possible while hostility continue do the government not need to call for an immediate cessation of hostility ceasefire during the period that be agree to get humanitarian aid in at the volume that be require it be not just question of use the pause to try to advance humanitarian good it be also about try to use the humanitarian pause to achieve some of the thing the hon member say as say early we have to be incredibly careful that we do not end up create false sense of security as the house will remember happen in srebrenica northern iraq and rwanda thank my right hon friend for his statement and all he be do to alleviate suffer in the region the human cost in israel and gaza be truly immense and heartbreaking will he join in commend the extraordinary bravery of the aid worker on the ground in gaza some of whom have tragically lose their life include over un worker my hon friend be entirely right hope particularly hot place in hell be reserve for those who murder humanitarian worker who have put themselves in harm way unarmed purely to protect the life and interest of their fellow humanity we have hear this afternoon that frankly this short pause be not work four hour will not achieve anything the fact that we be see palestinians be force to leave their home en masse be quite worrying will the minister condemn the act of violence and extremism by israeli settler in the west bank call on israeli authority to prevent that settler violence ensure that there be clear accountability for the perpetrator and condemn this extremist rhetoric the hon member will have hear what the prime minister and other member of the government have say in condemn settler violence we will continue to stand up for the rule of law and international humanitarian law on every occasion we be able to do so gregory campbell interruption be not gregory campbell but be happy to ask question think he be behind you all right call jim shannon thank you mr deputy speaker thank the minister for his reply which be positive and know he mean well can he provide an update on what progress have be make on discussion with jordan egypt and surround nation to secure the free passage of medical aid will that be consider as priority thank the hon member for his comment discussion be go on with jordan and egypt on that very point and will go tonight to egypt to try to further those discussion in set out what humanitarian pause would involve the secretary of state be set out the challenge at the heart of this those of we who believe that we should be work alongside our international colleague for an urgent ceasefire as the good way to end the palestinian bloodshed and the horror we be see in gaza know that any ceasefire that do not involve the immediate return of hostage and the dismantling of hamas be unlikely to be sustainable the minister talk about the conversation the new foreign secretary have have with the secretary of state in america the foreign secretary can not be in front of we so that can ask he this myself so will the minister urgently arrange meeting with the foreign secretary for my constituent whose father be be hold by hamas so that she may understand what this government be do for uk citizen who have hostage family assume that the hon member have speak to the crisis centre about that particular example if she have not hope she will and of course we will afford all support we can to her constituent the news of the burial in mass grave of baby child and other patient at al shifa hospital be heartbreaking as be the news of the murder mutilation and capture of baby child and other innocent civilian in israel on october agree with the shadow foreign secretary my right hon friend the member for tottenham mr lammy that the government must now urge concrete step to protect civilian life do the minister agree that we need humanitarian pause long enough to ensure that lifesave aid reach hospital as well as the release of hostage and the safe movement of innocent civilian we will undoubtedly continue to do everything we can to support humanitarian supply get in and to develop the concept of the pause to maximum effect it be the role of the government through their very strong diplomatic connection with all part of the region to do everything they can to drive forward those humanitarian aim apologise be new here and do not yet know everybody laughter call kenny macaskill thank you mr deputy speaker hamas today conjure up memory of christmas truce before the horror recommence but this be not soldier in the trench it be million people trap in tight urban environment include woman and child be that not the reason that humanitarian pause be insufficient and there must be an immediate ceasefire the circumstance that the hon member describe be precisely the reason why the british government put such high priority on try to advance those humanitarian aim some of which at least can be advance through the humanitarian pause we be so trenchantly seek on october ask the minister in this house about care for pregnant woman and new bear baby in gaza since ask that question three week ago approximately child have be bear amidst devastation and destruction give that it be quite clear that four hour pause be totally inadequate can the minister tell what specific step his department will take to protect hospital deliver humanitarian aid to pregnant woman and child and stop premature death the hon member make her point with great eloquence and it underline the effort and importance that the government attach to try to drive humanitarian support through these pause to those who desperately need it the government have be call for humanitarian pause for some time but the death toll have rise and the humanitarian crisis deepen by the hour as result we clearly need ceasefire to move to political process and political solution can the minister say what step he be take to formulate that political solution it be not just our government who be argue for this it be government around the world everyone be focus on try to bring this dreadful situation to conclusion and drive towards political process that be what we need the hon member ask what be do will go tonight to egypt to further these discussion the situation in gaza can not continue as it be and everything need to be do to bring this humanitarian devastation to an end follow on from the question ask by my hon friend the member for vauxhall florence eshalomi will the minister condemn act of violence and extremism by israeli settler in the west bank as the hon lady will know hope the prime minister and the government have condemn settler violence and urge the israeli government to crack down on it it be difficult to get aid and medicine into gaza but there be no shortage of arm in the region have be contact by many constituent concern about britain role in supply british make weapon to israel in the absence of the committees on arms export controls meeting at all this year what assurance can the minister give that the weapon we be supply be not be use in act of collective punishment refer the hon lady to my response few moment ago in which make clear that britain have the most rigorous arm sale regime anywhere in the world it be extremely important that we have that will look carefully to see whether there be any aspect of the hon lady question that suggest we should do more on friday the palestine red crescent society say that israeli force open fire on the intensive care unit at al quds hospital and médecins sans frontières report doctor in al shifa hospital say that sniper attack four patient inside that hospital we be see baby die what be happen be stain on our collective humanity implore the government please to join the overwhelming majority of the british public humanitarian organisation and other nation in call for an immediate ceasefire to prevent the further death of innocent civilian and resolve what be humanitarian catastrophe think the hon lady should put some great hope in the achievement of humanitarian pause and then the development of those pause in the meantime as she will be aware it be the policy of both the government and the opposition that we should promote pause not ceasefire will the minister confirm that it be the government position that there should be no compulsion for people to leave their home in gaza and that when people be displace by fight they must be allow to return home as soon as possible the government be acutely aware of the extraordinarily difficult situation in gaza and it be not for to give advice from the dispatch box to people on the ground there who need to assess their situation for themselves within their community the un say that telecommunication will begin to fail from thursday as fuel run out for the provide company some life have be save when people have be telephone to inform they that their home be about to be bomb can any step be take to deliver fuel specifically to telecommunication company have also see those report they be extremely worrying and they intensify the requirement to get fuel into gaza as quickly as possible among so many horror that we have see since the horrific and illegal attack by hamas on october the image of tiny baby in al shifa hospital in gaza be keep warm with improvise incubation be unbearable that be not for the want of incubator it be for the want of fuel the minister speak from the dispatch box few moment ago about the offer of fuel make by the israeli government yesterday but the head of one of the aid agency on the ground in gaza have explain what that offer be few jerry can leave outside the hospital amount to half an hour of generation time half an hour of fuel for generator be not what be need and it be not what international law require so can press the minister on what action he be take to hold the israeli government to account for the unacceptable stoppage of aid into gaza include fuel and for their maintenance of international law it be true think that litre of fuel be offer yesterday and it be reject by hamas that be the key point some fuel be offer obviously we hope that more fuel can get through but if hamas refuse to allow it to be use for the extremely important purpose that the hon lady have set out the position will not improve the new foreign secretary call gaza an open air prison in peacetime while we all stand with israel on october what be the limit of self defence population forcibly displace by donkey because there be no fuel or communication blackout when will the uk join france spain the un and all the aid agency in advocate cessation of hostility we can not go on like this hour day the hon lady make an eloquent plea for we to advance on all the thing that the government along with other be do everything they can to progress while the whole house should condemn unreservedly the atrocity commit against israeli civilian on october by the terror organisation hamas do his majesty government believe that the ongoing response of the israel defence forces remain proportionate and will they keep the matter under review draw the hon gentleman attention to what say early about the work of the israel defence forces and indeed the training they undergo which respect international humanitarian law and understand the obligation military force owe to civilian have constituent who be heartbroken and devastate about the continue conflict between israel and palestine hospital and patient particularly baby must be protect and can not become target do the minister agree that the aid that be get into gaza be still completely insufficient and that it be unacceptable that siege condition have not be lift as the hon lady suggest it be completely insufficient that be why we be argue so trenchantly for the opening of not just rafah but kerem shalom so that more aid can be get in for those who desperately need it after the terrorist atrocity of october and with an estimate palestinians dead there be new fear that of forced and permanent displacement of the palestinian people accompany by drumbeat of senior voice there be pressure on third country to take the gazan population as refugee can the minister take this opportunity to say that neither this government nor the international community regard that as acceptable in any way the hon lady once again demonstrate the dreadful position that the appalling act perpetrate by hamas terrorist on october have land people in think hear the minister correctly just now when he confirm report in the financial times that all but one of the hospital in the north of gaza have stop function that news be catastrophic and my constituent just want to know as all of we do that there be some hope that this hell be come to an end as such far to the response he give to the hon member for the cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown and my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms can ask the minister to describe the uk government diplomatic strategy he have mention that he will be travel this evening which of our partner will he be engage to bring this war to an end will be travel to egypt tonight but the discussion that be go on be about the hostage and the humanitarian situation which have explain extensively today there be also discussion about the politic and how we move on those discussion be go on not just within the british government but with our partner ally and like minded party overseas in particular through the extraordinary diplomatic reach of the british foreign office with all the country in the region which of course care as much as we do about the appalling loss of life in the then uk prime minister now the foreign secretary condemn the blockade of gaza as prison camp the siege condition have remain and that be the context in which this war have claim the life of civilian in gaza follow the horrific hamas attack that have cost the life of innocent civilian and lead to the hostage taking of over people the reality be that the long the gaza war continue the more palpable be the danger of further contagion not only in the west bank and jerusalem but across the region we could be on the precipice of regional war and of tension endure beyond gaza and israel and cause full scale conflict between israel and hezbollah that be why it be imperative for our government to work with international partner to seek the cessation of hostility and to work for an endure humanitarian ceasefire so much be at stake here and it be for our government to take that leadership role call on the minister to do so the hon member have set out with great eloquence the issue before we and it underline the absolute necessity to get back on to political track as swiftly as we can the minister continue to say that he want the government of israel to respect international human right law but last week he say that the government could not make determination whether that be happen he say it would be for court and lawyer to determine so which court and which lawyer and how and when should determination be make about whether israel be comply with international humanitarian law the point make last week be that it be not for ministers to assert what be in effect legal judgment and that it should be leave to the court think that be sensible measure for we to accept the hon member will be aware that there be many different people quote for example the guardian of the geneva convention and international humanitarian law and do not think there will be any difficulty in hear from the judicial authority on that matter the call for ceasefire be back by multiple united nations agency ngos pope francis more than british lawyer the country that vote in favour of un general assembly motion and of the public and yesterday the archbishop of canterbury say that the call for ceasefire be moral cry what will it take for the newly instal secretary of state to heed these international call and to support an immediate ceasefire yield to no one in my profound respect for the archbishop of canterbury but think the reason set out by both government and opposition front benchers about why that be not practical approach should be listen to with care meanwhile we will do everything we can to address the humanitarian situation which have be so eloquently set out across the house give the grave seriousness and scale of the humanitarian disaster unfold in gaza it be vital that the length of humanitarian pause be sufficient to allow aid and supply to reach safely those who need they in the statement the minister acknowledge that four hour be not enough so the first question be by the government own assessment how long be need secondly will the government finally meet the shadow foreign secretary request for an international aid co ordinator to be appoint to make sure that aid really reach where it be need the hon gentleman make an important point about the co ordination of aid but principally we need to get it into the country have set out that this be about not just the length of the pause but the nature of how the aid be then distribute the british government be work with our partner to progress all those thing give thank to islamic relief for the heroic work it be do in get aid to people in need in gaza however this be not natural disaster and aid and supply can be switch back on do the minister agree that it be unacceptable for israel not to lift its siege condition pay tribute as the hon member do to islamic relief which visit in birmingham on sunday with andy street the west midlands mayor islamic relief be do extraordinary work still it have access to fuel and it have access to way of make sure that water purification can continue to take place we work closely with it as we work with so many other to try to bring an end to this dreadful situation avi shlaim be an arab jew who be bear in baghdad serve in the israel defence forces and be retire professor of international affair at the university of oxford he probably know more about the israeli palestinian conflict than most of we and he say revenge be not policy do the british government reject the position of the israeli government that they should have overall security control of gaza after current military operation think we can all agree that revenge be not policy but give the appalling event of october want to emphasise that the israeli government have an absolute right to self defence the minister say that the argument for and against ceasefire have be fully rehearse but the situation in the hospital and the ongoing slaughter of innocent civilian flee the hostility illustrate that these humanitarian pause be not work the difficulty be that our constituent can see this terrible situation unfold on the television every evening and that be why they be write to we in their thousand about it what they want to know and what want to know be this how many more innocent people have to die before the uk government will support call for ceasefire from both side the government and indeed labour front benchers have explain why call for ceasefire do not work at the moment we have explain the israeli government right to self defence but also that hamas have make it clear that not only do they not want ceasefire but they want to repeat what happen on october the position in those circumstance be that to alleviate human suffering and to progress humanitarian effort to get supply in we should try to develop the humanitarian pause and that be what we will continue to do the suffering of innocent civilian in gaza be intolerable the siege must end the bombing must end and we need an end to hostility do the minister share my worry that the way the war on hamas be be prosecute the constant bombing the scale of the loss of life and suffering run the risk of radicalise people and drive they into the arm of hamas and other terrorist extremist would he comment on that and on whether that view be be express to the israeli government the british government have many friend and brilliant diplomatic network in the region and we express ourselves without fear or favour to give the good advice that the british government have the minister say that it be not for ministers to confirm or ascertain what be and be not war crime but remind he that government ministers rightly condemn vladimir putin for his war crime in ukraine very quickly after the invasion the minister mention the sanctity of hospital which be place protect under the geneva convention yet when mention this exact issue last week he do not accept my analysis of the geneva convention with report of hospital be bomb idf sniper fire into al shifa and civilian include child be fire on while try to evacuate under white flag repeat what will it take for the government and opposition front benchers to call act such as this what they be war crime have set out very clearly during this statement and in response to member across the house the absolutely essential nature of the progress we seek to make hope that the hon member will accept that my answer this week will be no different from the answer give he on wednesday last week thank the house for its patience we have come in just inside the speaker time limit on point of order mr deputy speaker not to detract in any way from the integrity of the minister the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell but many have speak about the absurd scrutiny situation of the new foreign secretary be member of the house of lords and unable to answer question in this chamber give the gravity of the situation we be deal with be it not right that we change the standing orders to enable we to call lords to appear in this place to answer question on this matter from the dispatch box the hon gentleman be well aware that the speaker have make statement on this the matter be under consideration and it be not my place to seek to second guess the advice that the speaker be give thank the minister for his statement and wish he safe and productive journey bill present criminal

your majesty most dutiful and loyal subject the commons of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in parliament assemble beg leave to offer our humble thank to your majesty for the gracious speech which your majesty have address to both houses of parliament economic growth inform the house that mr speaker have select amendment in the name of the leader of the opposition call rachel reeves beg to move an amendment at the end of the question to add but respectfully regret that the gracious speech fail to include legislative proposal to prevent repeat of the economic fallout from the september growth plan by amend the budget responsibility and national audit act to give the office for budget responsibility the power to produce and publish forecast for any government fiscal event which include tax and spending decision with long term effect over threshold to be specify in new charter for budget responsibility it be fair to say that the uk be not exactly grip with excitement at the content of the conservative government king speech it be as if minister have rummage down the back of the sofa and find legislative loose change broken biro some old bills cover in fluff and even an old prime minister in this current tory era of three word slogan the country be think not five more year but be that it it be clear what the government approach be in the run up to that election they have give up on try to improve the country so all they can now do be attempt to divide it but they will fail because the conservatives simply do not understand the priority hope and value of the people of britain today after five prime ministers one of they recycle and seven chancellor since the conservatives find change personnel rather easy than change our country for the well be listen to the right hon lady speech about value the value of my constituent be such that they be call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza do she support those value we have just have an hour and half worth of question on that issue be go to focus on how to grow the economy and tackle the cost of living crisis wish that today we be debate the government significant economic reform and new measure to get our economy back on track after year of tory economic failure but there be any their big tax reform be to consult on bring in new duty on vape their big energy bill do not even low people energy bill in fact third of the bills in the king speech be reheat from the previous session how out of touch must the prime minister be to peer down from foot up in his helicopter and conclude that everything be go so well that there be no need for legislation and government action to help unlock growth this be the final king speech before the general election and yet this set of proposal will not quicken the pulse get the economy roar or lift people living standard where be the ambition where be the plan as the british chambers of commerce have point out the king speech open with an aspiration to increase economic growth but it fail to outline how that will happen do my right hon friend share the concern of many that rather than improve economic growth be forecast to go into reverse next year under the tories do she agree that this new tory economic failure do not bode well for people living standard next year thank my hon friend for that intervention she will have see that the forecast publish by the bank of england just over week ago show that the economy be expect to flatline not just throughout the rest of this year but all through next year as well there be something quite apt even reveal about the conservatives want to use this king speech to protect the user of driverless car from the damage they might inflict on other the conservative government have be drive quite dangerously for year the current name driver of the vehicle the third in four year be nowhere to be see but there will be no protection for the prime minister or his party from voter verdict at the general election whenever that come the government king speech be lost opportunity for our country there be no legislation to reform the antiquated planning process and accelerate decision around our critical national infrastructure instead planning process continue to hold back the success of our offshore wind sector life science and there be no pension reform to encourage grow british company to stay here instead of be force abroad for funding which contribute to the uk stagnate growth there be no serious plan to help get energy bill down the energy price cap have increase by half in this parliament yet the energy secretary have admit that the government energy bill would necessarily bring energy bill down whereas labour have plan for clean power by national wealth fund insulate home to low bill and the creation of gb energy there be no focus from the government on industrial strategy or on put an industrial strategy council on statutory footing to help drive the growth and investment that we need instead the government reach for stick plaster when important sector hit crisis we need positive long term plan to make the most of our asset and create good quality job here in britain commend the right hon lady for her strong and wise word like and other in the house she believe that the life science sector can grow and do much more in the pharmaceutical sector alone provide of research and development spending there be almost job in the industry and it contribute billion in gross value add to gdp do the right hon lady agree that if we be to ensure that everyone can gain from life science there must be well distribution across all of this great united kingdom of gb and ni and that ni must be part of that could not agree more with the hon gentleman our life science sector be key for great britain and northern ireland and yet too many business be look to relocate include to the republic of ireland but we want those job and those investment here in britain there be no legislation in this king speech for fairer tax measure the chancellor and the prime minister have be so quick to raise taxis they have do so time between they that we now have the high tax burden in year it be the big tax hike ever in single parliament with work people and business hit hard yet the government allow unjustifiable tax loophole to remain believe that if people make britain their home they should pay their taxis here too that be why we will abolish the non dom tax status and introduce modern scheme for people who be genuinely live in the uk for short period why be it so hard for this prime minister to say the same there be no legislation in this king speech to increase security at work or to update employment right have confidence to plan family future should be not luxury but something that work people deserve and we need to grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out if an economy be not work for work people it be not work at all this king speech have no serious plan for tackle the cost of live crisis or for grow the uk economy the conservative economic failure be pile up high failure on growth failure on infrastructure investment failure on the cost of living failure on public service and failure on tax the responsibility for such disappointment and damage have be conservative team effort these past year the government can not get our economy back on track or make our country well off the conservatives can not and have not tackle the cost of live crisis because they be the cost of living crisis do my right hon friend agree that we be still pay the price of the fail tory policy since that have weaken our nhs strip funding from our local council service and stop labour school repair programme thank my hon friend for that intervention the truth be that the combination of austerity which be five prime ministers ago brexit without plan which relate to most of they and the kamikaze budget have contribute to the parlous state of our economy and the cost of living crisis that we be endure today this be party lead and say lead in the loose sense of the word by prime minister with no mandate whatsoever and with no authority or vision for the future this prime minister appear to be spend more time polish his cv in conversation with elon musk than fight for the livelihood of manufacture worker in scunthorpe port talbot and derby and it be the previous prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss who still set the tune for so many in the conservative party she want to scrap the banker bonus cap in the kamikaze budget last year and that have now be dutifully deliver by this prime minister and this chancellor when the previous prime minister call this year for delay the timetable for new electric car by five year undermine both the net zero consensus and the british automotive industry this prime minister and this chancellor deliver today the former prime minister so call growth commission be set out its demand for next week autumn statement oblivious to the damage already do will the chancellor tell the house whether he agree with the person who appoint he to do the job he be now do and her proposal to slash corporation tax abolish inheritance tax abolish stamp duty and other unfunded commitment that make last year mini budget look like small fry with tax cut announce totalling billion labour will never gamble with the livelihood of work people as the conservatives have labour economic approach be build on rock of fiscal responsibility with respect for taxpayer money we will work in partnership with industry to bring about the change that our country so desperately need we know what the tories do last autumn they blow up our economy with their reckless unfunded promise and trashing of our economic institution it be collective failure from the tories it be not just one bad apple but whole orchard of irresponsibility the conservative leadership contest of summer produce sum total of billion of unfunded promise the chancellor do not want to be leave out his leadership candidacy might not have be as successful or last as long as he may have wish but there be still time for he to make almost billion of unfunded commitment himself on corporation tax business rate and defence with no idea how those commitment would be fund follow the leadership election last year conservative cabinet ministers try to blindfold the nation and global financial market by prevent the office for budget responsibility from publish its assessment the conservatives know that the truth would hurt but they continue to gamble with the livelihood of our country the pound crash pension be put in peril and interest rate soar work people be make to pay the price for the conservatives kamikaze budget and reckless eagerness to cut the taxis of the wealthy few it be reckless it be irresponsible and with labour it will never happen the result be an average conservative mortgage penalty of each and every month for hard work homeowner this out of touch government do not have clue about what that really mean for people that be lot of money to try to find from nowhere each and every month it mean holiday cancel spend cut back and life make hard some family be have to downsize and other who have be try to get on the housing ladder for year have have their dream snuff out meanwhile rent rise as landlord see their mortgage go up and want to pass the cost on my right hon friend be make good point about housing cost and the shortage of housing in this country be it not therefore astounding that give the climate we be in there be not one single word about housing in the whole king speech there be not single word about the shortage of housing or the rise cost of housing no long term proposal to build on this vague commitment of home and no idea how to build they my hon friend speak powerfully on what he know well on top of the big challenge with house building and the government get rid of their housing target the number of homeowner in arrear on their mortgage be also up staggering compare with year ago the conservatives be no long the party of home ownership high housing cost be the last thing people need in painful cost of living crisis it should never have happen in the first place and it must never happen again will the right hon lady enlighten we on the labour party view on our precious green belt because my constituent be terrified that labour government will build house all over it labour approach be brownfield first we also know that there be land designate as green belt that be no such thing for example there be petrol station in tottenham that people can not get planning permission for because it be classify as green belt people want that land build on and think we can all agree across the house that we need reform to allow that to happen but this government scrap the house building target home ownership be fall under the conservatives the conservatives be once the party of home ownership they can no long claim that mantle it be labour today that be the party of home ownership and of aspiration for working family today the conservatives can show that they have learn lesson from last year they can back labour commitment to strengthen the office for budget responsibility in our amendment we believe that where fiscal event be make significant and permanent tax and spending change the obr should be able to freely and independently publish forecast of the impact of those change no government of the day should be able to stop it from do so in the event of an emergency where change must be introduce at speed and forecast can not be produce in time the obr would be allow to set date for when it can publish forecast the public should be able to read an independent assessment on the health of our economy to understand the consequence of proposal and to see the price on the menu the amendment should not be remotely controversial and look forward to see conservative mp and ministers join we in support this sensible measure today if they do not it will show that they have not learn thing and that the conservatives continue to present real and present danger to our economy what will be the legacy of year of this conservative government they have damage our economy trash our public service fail to invest in the industry of the future squeeze people living standard and cause calamitous cost of living crisis labour government will clean up that mess we will clamp down on waste and fraud from the pandemic because the country be sick of be rip off and we want our money back we will tax fairly spend wisely and grow the economy we will get the nhs back on its foot the conservatives have break our public service before but labour government have fix they in the past and we will do so again as bad as the public finance be under the conservatives there will always be choice so we will abolish the non dom tax status and use that money to help our nhs tackle record waiting time and introduce free breakfast club for all primary school age child we will close the tax loophole that give private equity manager huge tax break we will close the tax loophole benefit private school which gain from not have to pay vat and business rate and use that money to support the of child attend our state school if the conservatives want to have fight over who be most aspirational for our young people when the ceiling be crumble in our school say bring it on after year of conservative government the question that people will be ask at the next election be simple do my family and feel well off after year of conservative government do our school our hospital and our transport infrastructure work well than when the conservatives come to office year ago in fact do anything in britain work well today than when the conservatives come to office the answer be resound no this king speech be not remotely up to the task of change our country for the well and meet the challenge head on real change can not come from five more painful year under the conservatives but only from fresh start with labour the labour party be the only party of economic responsibility and with the ability to provide the change of direction and confidence that our country need as this king speech show this desperate decay government be out of idea out of excuse and increasingly out of time if the prime minister and chancellor be so confident about the conservatives record let we take it to the ballot box and let the british people decide it be an honour to speak in the first king speech debate for more than year her late majesty be figure of grace and continuity and we now look forward to his majesty the king lead we as she do through troubled time it be always pleasure to debate with the shadow chancellor although in whole year of my be chancellor this be the first time we have have an economy debate and now we know why she have be busy write book or rather wikipedia have be busy write her book today see she have be busy copy and paste conservative language about tax may tell she gently that that will take she only so far conservative members will never forget what happen under gordon brown who she campaign for income tax up national insurance up stamp duty up fuel duty up pension up and multiple other taxis up let we turn to some of the shadow chancellor assertion she say that the economy be flatline what she do not tell the house be that since labour leave the economy in the deep recession since the second world war we in this country have grow fast than spain portugal italy france the netherlands austria germany or japan she do not mention that after global pandemic and energy shock our economy be nearly big than it be pre pandemic that be high for example than country such as germany whose economy be only large not least thank to the furlough scheme introduce by my right hon friend the prime minister the shadow chancellor also do not mention that when it come to the fast grow industry we be do even well in the last year under conservative governments we have build europe large tech sector double the size of germany and three time that of france it be the third large in the world we also have europe large life science sector save more life than any other country globally with vaccine and treatment discover in britain we have more offshore wind than anywhere in europe bar germany and norway it be the third large sector in the continent we also have world lead creative industry sector include europe large film and tv industry and thriving publishing industry that have even produce book write by the shadow chancellor which helpfully collate some fascinating information from the world wide web the chancellor talk about what he see as some success why do he not address the problem of small modular reactor sheffield forgemasters in my constituency could be build smr but it have be wait for month for the government to make decision on go ahead for the right technique itm power which be leader in green hydrogen be build plant in germany which be spend billion on it in the next few year while in this country we be spend billion so we be lose the international race on that the first big infrastructure decision that take be on nuclear when assign million to sizewell completely agree with the hon member about the potential of smr that be why we set up competition and with the previous energy secretary stipulate that it should finish by the end of this calendar year so that we can proceed as quickly as possible on smr because it could be an important part of our net zero future the shadow chancellor central argument be that we can get growth only by borrow billion year more interruption well be listen to her word she may not have mention this in her speech but on october she say on the today programme that she want to take borrow word we deliver all those achievement in technology life science creative industry and advanced manufacturing industry during time when we be cut borrowing which go down by between and the start of the pandemic that be the difference unlike labour the conservatives know that we can not borrow our way to growth we have to do the hard work to support entrepreneur and innovator include by keep their taxis down which labour have never want to do because we have do just that the international monetary fund say that after inflation have be bring to target from the end of this country will have fast growth than france germany or italy no shortcut just hard work to get one of the fast growth rate in europe on investment in renewable energy ey have confirm today that the uk have slip far back on the attractiveness index so it be now behind india china and australia on offshore wind the chancellor know that allocation round be disaster what will he do to rectify that on nuclear he talk about smr be the future but they be not there be not successful smr anywhere in the world and nuscale in the united states have just be abandon after rise to an estimate cost of billion do not accept that we be not an extremely attractive place we have third large renewable sector in europe and be the large european provider of offshore wind can we do more yes we can particularly by improve access to the grid the house should expect to hear more from we on that we have lot of talk from the shadow chancellor about the cost of living crisis but she barely mention that the big pressure on the cost of living be cause by the rise in inflation in fact it do not get mention at all in her conference speech because we have take difficult decision inflation have fall by since its peak core inflation be now low than in nearly half the entire eu membership say gently to she that if she be to reflate the economy by ramp up borrowing by billion year price would go up and family would end up pay more for their petrol their food their electricity and their mortgage that be why that be the wrong approach one issue on borrowing that have not be talk about be that it be now four year since this place agree that we should regulate the buy now pay later lender under this government watch the number of people borrow from these company to make end meet during the cost of living crisis have double and of those people be struggle and borrow from other lender to pay their debt yet we have still see no regulation at all from the government if the chancellor want to prove that he be actually on the side of the people and understand the bill that they have rack up pay for this tory government failure will he finally commit to regulate these loan shark as the hon member might have hear if she have be at oral question we be act on this and have be consult on solution since march this year start that at the spring budget but we want to get the answer right we want to crack down on rogue lender but also ensure that the financing that appropriate people can offer responsibly be available want to talk about the pressure on ordinary family because the shadow chancellor also talk about income and the tax burden on work family what have happen since to adult on the low legally payable wage when we take over from labour that wage be an hour today it be an hour after inflation gross pay for those on the low legally payable wage have go up by the number of people on low pay define as less than two third of median hourly earning have halve at the same time because conservative government want to make work pay we increase the threshold before which people start to pay tax or national insurance from to take home pay after tax for people on the adult main minimum wage have therefore go up by more than after inflation that be big percentage increase than for people on much high income notwith stand what the chancellor have say my constituent in edinburgh west like those in much of the rest of the country be listen intently to the king speech for bill or anything that might help they with the cost of food and specifically energy this come winter but there be nothing and it have be admit that the petroleum bill will not do anything to help household in this country do he appreciate why ordinary working family think that the government be simply out of touch with respect think the hon member need to look at the fact we have give an average of in cost of live support to family across the country this year and last in scotland household have benefit from our cost of living payment which have reach more than million pensioner want to return to my main point about the impact of make work pay as result of that change not only have lot of people be lift out of poverty but unemployment have go down by million after go up by nearly half million under labour and the unemployment rate have halve that be the difference if we make work pay as the conservatives do we lift people out of poverty and put people into work what would the minimum wage be worth now if the right hon member party have succeed in its attempt to wreck the legislation when it be introduce by the last labour government simply say that we do not just build on that reform but improve it massively more than labour propose because we turn it into the national living wage which be far more generous than the original minimum wage accord to the house of commons library in the tax burden on the low income decile be on the top income decile it be be that fair because we believe in progressive tax system we introduce the change that just outline which mean that people on the low legal wage be get more after tax that be significantly big increase than for people on high decile one of the main thing the shadow chancellor mention be her amendment on the obr understand the political game of try to draw attention to the mini budget but she should know that the obr be already legally require to publish two forecast year as will happen under this government at successive autumn statement and spring budgets today proposal be dangerous because despite what she say it would hamper the government when act in an emergency as we do in the pandemic will tell she why instead of take decisive action government would feel oblige to enter week process with the obr in case the outcome of the independent process that she advocate make any crisis bad by highlight significant loosening of the fiscal rule what be most extraordinary about the amendment be that at the same time that the shadow chancellor try to claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility in this house only this morning she brief the paper that she want to unfreeze income tax threshold billion commitment and make full expensing permanent which be billion commitment that be all without an obr forecast in sight that kind of irresponsibility from labour be exactly why we set up the obr in the first place this be an argument not just about job and work but about poverty labour try to eradicate poverty by tinker with the benefit system and gordon brown tax credit we all remember the poverty plus pound idea whereby if someone just below the poverty threshold be give they be somehow magically lift out of destitution instead the conservative government have reduce the number in absolute poverty after housing cost by million people by make work pay and by reduce the number of child live in workless household because they be five time more likely to be in absolute poverty than household in which the adult work make work pay be moral duty and not just an economic necessity as only conservative understand work be the good way to eliminate poverty what be the chancellor reflection on the fact that every labour government have leave office with unemployment higher my reflection be quite simply that the labour party do not understand how to lift people out of poverty labour member do not like we talk about the fact that nearly million people have be lift out of absolute poverty under conservative government because that do not fit their austerity story but the reality be that conservative government have be responsible for very important piece of social progress want to turn to the autumn statement because as we start to win the battle against inflation we can focus on the next stage which be growth next week we will see an autumn statement for growth because no business can expand without hire additional staff will address labour supply issue to help fill the nearly million vacancy we have work with the excellent secretary of state for work and pensions that will build on the hour of free childcare offer that announce for all eligible child over nine month in the spring budget will also focus on increase business investment because despite the fact that our growth have be fast than that of many of our european neighbour our productivity be still low my right hon friend talk about growth and productivity and he know that it be my strong view that steel be an incredibly important material for growth here in this country will he reassure the very concerned steelworker in scunthorpe that he be concentrate on that and work on it on our behalf my hon friend have talk to consistently and powerfully since become chancellor about the issue face the steel industry she be strong advocate for her constituent it be at the top of my mind as we try to chart well future for british steel we will bear in mind the many comment she have make the shadow chancellor say in her conference speech that she would remove the barrier to business investment by back the builder not the blocker only week later her party promptly turn and become blocker by water down change to the rule on nutrient neutrality which would have unlock the building of home that be family whose future be on hold because of labour political game on top of all the measure in the autumn statement we will have the bills from the king speech include trade bill that will confirm our membership of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership make we part of group that wield combined gdp of trillion and presence in the indo pacific where the majority of global growth will be the automated vehicles bill which the shadow chancellor mock will make the uk one of the first country in the world to have legal structure to allow driverless car the digital markets competition and consumers bill will modernise our digital law to boost online shopping by make it safe the offshore petroleum licensing bill will secure our energy independence by replace import oil and gas with domestically produce fuel as we transition to net zero the leader of the opposition call the king speech something that will only bring more of the same in way he be right more growth more job more pay more opportunity and more prosperity we be not follow the easy path of open the national cheque book and maxe the country credit card by borrow billion year more we be take path that be more difficult yes but more durable and one that will turn we into one of the most prosperous country in europe commend it to the house rise order some member be seek to contribute to the debate and we have until pm after the scottish national party spokesperson propose to introduce an immediate time limit of six minute which may have to fall to five call the snp spokesperson thank you mr deputy speaker do not hold out much hope of enlightenment from this debate and it be fair to say that be underwhelme this be truly zombie government so bereft of idea and talent that they have scour the shed of chipping norton to find former prime minister who along with his liberal democrat coalition partner set most of the economic woe on their way for scotland and the other nation of the uk and resurrect he into their cabinet what signal what shamble it be to the shame of westminster that the government spend so much time relive past failure continue to do the same thing over and over culture war rhetoric punish the vulnerable and ignore the suffering of the most vulnerable and the poor one of the many former prime ministers of this fail government although to be fair an elect one use to talk about those people just about manage have news for she and for this place they ai just about manage any more they be struggle many more each day be fail to get by food bill energy bill mortgage and rent be crush they give the misery that the government have work through austerity the infamous mini budget and everything else they should have put the cost of live at the forefront of the king speech they should have listen to those struggle to pay their electricity bill put food on the table and keep roof over their head instead of talk about tent they should have be talk about rent while they pound the slogan of division by say stop the boat trust the public will ensure that all they do for this terrible government be stop the vote of course be accountable and elect be not an issue for this place the tories and labour will always simply create another lord to do their bidding if they need to do so in time so obviously mark by escalate living cost the no concern on the doorstep of scotland and contest the other nation of the uk be the cost of living the king speech glaringly overlook the need for policy to assist household grapple with food and energy cost mortgage and rent while the scottish government have make concerted and targeted effort to shield scot from the brunt of westminster policy the omnipresent shadow of these often cruel westminster directive remain inescapable the king speech starkly underscore the unreliability of westminster governments in serve scotland interest with both the tories and labour wed to low growth brexit anchor economy independence and return to the european union where all partner be treat as equal be the only viable path for the prosperity of scotland the scottish government within their limit capacity strive to cushion scot from westminster harsh policy yet scotland full potential remain constantly stifle under the uk policy regime theme will return to shortly on the hon gentleman logic if brexit be the impediment to growth why be it that since pre pandemic time britain have grow fast than either france or germany tory member keep peddle this line but what they know and what everybody else know be that they start from low base because they tank the economy in the first place they have to live up to that responsibility they claim high growth from low point of entry interruption they can try to shout down but will make progress the king speech which be alarmingly brief on tackle the cost of living crisis be miss opportunity to offer concrete measure for relief it pay lip service to reduce inflation and ease living cost but lack substantive policy proposal labour too be offer little on the cost of living crisis where be the measure that could be take now to help people in their home completely absent of course that be just part of labour do scare the tory voter approach to secure office the uk economic stagnation which be evidence by recent datum underscore systemic failure to foster growth post financial crisis there be nothing in the king speech to help support people our food and drink industry or our tourism and hospitality sector that be something the chancellor will need to correct before next week in uk battling unlike what the government claim rampant destitution the failure of the king speech to prioritise poverty reduction be indefensible with million include shocking number of child unable to meet their basic need the situation in the uk be dire scotland low destitution rate be testament to snp policy such as the scottish child payment but there be no attempt to replicate that anywhere in this house or to suggest that we do so the eradication of poverty remain more distant prospect under the current westminster regime labour stance echo tory rhetoric and policy leave independence as scotland only hope for fair and dynamic economy the snp spokesman be outline to the chamber his utopian world under an snp government can he outline why under the snp government education standard in scotland have fall at record level and nhs standard in scotland have fall at record level and why his government have fail the people of scotland on the delivery of public service that be what the hon gentleman have in his prepared statement but when we look at the fact we see that that be not correct scotland accident and emergency department for example have outperform the rest of the uk for the past eight year we have more doctor and nurse per head of population than anywhere else in the uk on public service the tories be push council to bankruptcy in england in scotland we be manage to negotiate with union to avoid strike and keep the economy move which be not be replicate by this tory government down here despite constraint the scottish snp government have implement significant policy to alleviate the cost of living crisis we have freeze council tax introduce the scottish child payment support disabled child offer free school meal and provide free bus travel those be just few example of the scottish government proactive step those measure though effective highlight the limitation of devolution under the westminster system underscore the urgent need for great power in scotland for scotland to support its citizen fully despite be nation rich in energy resource our people still face the press challenge of fuel poverty and high energy cost current uk energy policy and management continue to fail the people of scotland the fact that our energy wealth be significant be not open to challenge despite numerous attempt to tell the people of scotland that their oil and gas resource be run out the uk government now say that they will grant new licence every year scotland be produce six time more gas than it consume however that abundance contrast sharply with the high price they be expect to pay and the increase fuel poverty face by our elderly in particular in just two year the fuel poverty rate among pensioner be concern trend that highlight another disconnect between resource richness and public benefit westminster policy have continually fail to translate scotland natural energy wealth into tangible benefit for its populace they have do quite the opposite they have result in an oppressively toxic cost of living and inflationary effect for scottish household the lack of target measure in the king speech to address energy bill support far underscore that critic from various sector have voice their disappointment emphasise the need for far more action on price investment and insulation and many more renewable energy source the snp have say we should have energy bill rebate and action on basic cost we should have mortgage interest rate tax relief and there should be action on food cost but of course we have not hear that from anywhere else in this chamber in response to the challenge pose by westminster policy the scottish government have be proactive in implement measure to mitigate the impact on its resident those action include as mention freeze council tax and provide additional support for heating cost for the most severely disabled child and young people during winter furthermore the scottish government commitment to renewable energy and sustainability align with the broad goal of transition to clean more self sufficient energy future westminster have singly fail to invest most notably over decade of dither and delay on the peterhead carbon capture opportunity and subsequent potential hydrogen bonanza and in its abject failure to meet the scottish government million investment in the just transition incidentally another area where the scottish government have have to step in to plug the gap on reserved westminster inaction the transfer of energy employment welfare and economic power to the scottish parliament be essential with those power the scottish government could implement more effective policy to support their citizen through the ongoing energy and cost of living crisis look globally nation comparable in size to scotland boast vibrant economy that benefit their citizen country such as iceland norway and denmark exhibit low income inequality and poverty rate and high social mobility compare with the uk that comparison raise crucial question why should scotland remain tethered to westminster system that fail to resonate with its value and hinder its potential to be fair wealthy and happy the king speech be stark reminder of westminster detachment from scotland need and the uk broad societal challenge it highlight the necessity of independence for scotland the only path that lead towards more equitable prosperous future in line with the aspiration and value of the scottish people call the chair of the treasury committee it have be say that we enjoy holiday from history between the fall of the berlin wall and september but unfortunately history have now etch two more horrendous date into our memory february for russia evil invasion of ukraine and october for hamas evil terrorist attack on innocent israelis it be against this tumultuous backdrop that we discuss his majesty historic first gracious speech the first king speech for year and speech that represent profound moment in the stability and continuity of our unwritten constitution that we be able to change our sovereign and change our prime minister twice last year and arrive at the gracious speech with entirely peaceful transition of power be something that we should all find profoundly move our world seem increasingly dangerous and around the perimeter of nato we see terrible conflict and lot of mischief be play to stir up conflict as proud member of the nato parliamentary assembly know how important it be that nato country continue to show unity and that our door be open to new member such as sweden and finland as well as of course ukraine moldova and hope georgia draw attention to my interest in that country it be time that putin realise that annex his neighbour give he more nato on his border not less in his majesty gracious speech there be not lot to distract the treasury committee that will come in next week autumn statement and let add in case colleague be interested that in addition to our committee scrutiny of that statement the bank of england and the financial regulator we currently have open inquiry into access to finance for small and medium sized business quantitative tightening sexism in the city and central bank digital currency be glad that his majesty and also the chancellor today have emphasise the focus on increase economic growth be glad that everyone now agree that we should continue to take action to bring down inflation ease the cost of live for family and help business to fund new job and investment be also glad that ministers will help the bank of england to return inflation to target it be the bank of england that have raise mortgage rate and the governor of the bank of england have acknowledge that the only increase that mortgage payer be now see be thank to its effort to control inflation and be nothing to do with the decision of our now responsible treasury these decision will help household finance reduce public sector debt and safeguard the financial security of our country about which my constituent care deeply tomorrow we should see milestone in the quest to reduce inflation the market expect the consumer price index to decline to and combine with wage growth of more than that mean that real wage growth have return to our economy we have also see low pay fall dramatically few than of the many million more people who be now in work be low pay thank to the national living wage there be one omission from the gracious speech in respect of what regard as constitutional sexism in our country no step be announce to end the indefensible system of man only seat in the other place the hereditary peerage be almost exclusively for man and the hereditary titles female succession bill which try to get enact in the last parliamentary session in order to change that sadly do not make it on to the statute book shall try again to get good slot in the ballot for private member bills and if do so will reintroduce that bill if do not get good slot will invite my colleague to take up the baton we now come to maiden speech it be real honour to be here speak in this king speech debate after by election campaign that go on for one or two month long than think some of we anticipate however it leave with friendship and experience that hope will stay with throughout my lifetime there be perhaps one or two memory of slightly scar use of statistic in leaflet but the math teacher in hop that will be able to forget those rather soon most of all there be an overwhelming sense that the community represent be look for change change back to stable government look to the long term with plan to get our future back on track to make sure our community can plan for the future with confidence again rather than worry about where the next setback will come from to ensure that our business of the future can invest with confidence again and seize the benefit of the industrial transition to come and to ensure that our fantastic rural farming community can get back to plough on with confidence put food on our plate and look after our fantastic countryside this be my maiden speech pay tribute to my predecessor nadine dorries think it fair to say that we differ somewhat in politic and personal style but it be clear to that she break through many barrier on her way to this house and she should take great pride in that also want to thank not one but two prime ministers for their incredibly warm welcome to the house over recent week although have to warn the current prime minister that although there be some area in which differ from my predecessor intend to continue her proud tradition of robust opposition to this government let give credit where it be due though be aware that by election over recent week have deprive the government of number of member to take up front bench position but have to applaud the prime minister surprise creativity yesterday in fill one of those spot it have give an unexpected opportunity to repay that bipartisanship and to extend warm welcome back to the former prime minister as he return to frontline politic as fellow aston villa fan though really hope that his time as foreign secretary will not deprive he of an opportunity to enjoy our beloved team at the london stadium laughter be embarrassed to admit that if some time ago someone have tell that would be stand here as the labour mp for mid beds would have respond in language that could only have be describe as rather unparliamentary while they may come from very different background my friend my family who be here today my former pupil and my former colleague at the bank of england may all be have similar reaction to see here in the chamber however could not be prouder to have the honour of represent part of the county grow up in although the name of my constituency may suggest otherwise there be absolutely nothing middling about the beautiful town and village of mid bedfordshire take full advantage of the convention that maiden speech be make without interruption fully intend to make use of this opportunity to talk at great length in great detail about each and every one of those town and village and what make they special know that member will welcome that can feel the enthusiasm in the chamber laughter be sorry to disappoint some however but will try to keep it brief as explain why those who be unable to join we on the by election trail really do miss out from the beautiful village of shillington to our picturesque market town of shefford to our fantastic norman monastery in woburn mid bedfordshire really do have something for everyone in cranfield members will find one of the good example of our world lead research innovation and enterprise combine cranfield aerospace be propel forward green aviation lead on proposal for hydrogen fuel flight base on research undertake at cranfield university along the greensand ridge walker will find some of the good countryside that britain have to offer from woburn through millbrook to ampthill and beyond that will also give member the crucial chance to keep those step up ahead of any future by election as they near flitwick members will find woburn center parcs with which many family from right across the country will be familiar from getaway and celebration over the year and where hundred of my constituent work all the year round to bring joy to holidaymaker let draw the attention of the whip on both side of the house to the subtropical swimming paradise as well as great place to spend an afternoon suggest that it might be more amenable option for the whip to offer member should they approach they in the future feel the lure of an escape to the jungle that might be on the card and want some advice about what to do next but as anyone who have be to my constituency will know it be not just the place that be so special it be the people live there people like rob and sue who have form close bond with their community in harlington through covid want to do more to bring they together after lockdown they found the fantastic hub and spoke café which continue to go from strength to strength in delight resident and also recently impress as robust critic as the odd newsnight journalist people like richard and the whole ampthill firework organise committee who step up when the treasured local firework display be under threat back in to ensure that it continue they put on display each year that wow thousand and raise many thousand more for really fantastic charity across my constituency and people like lou and shaun who have put so much into make the brewery tap in shefford such beloved pillar of our community they run charity breakfast and organise armed service day and crucially they have recently have to put up with rather more visit from certain labour parliamentary candidate now the mp than any publican should have to endure but they do so with brave and smile face from these story mr speaker you might be under the impression that all be well in my constituency and that life for everyone be rosy but sadly the great potential of my place be not on offer to all my resident take margaret from broom who be in her partially sight and in poor health for month she have be wait to see her gp for month she have be phone up at am and wait until am only to be tell yet again that there be no appointment available yet again she would have to phone back another day after month of waiting her understandable anxiety about her health get too much for she and she have to spend the limited saving available to she to see gp privately pay for something that should have be free to she at the point of use this can not be right or take steven and his family in stewartby they do everything right they save up work hard and buy the family home of their dream on nearby estate but when mortgage rate rocket up their repayment go up by nearly month that be an amount that no ordinary family can be expect to have to hand and it mean that hard choice have to be make holiday cancel enrich opportunity forgone and life narrow under the brutal reality of have to budget for an economic situation that be not of their making or take sarah and her daughter sarah have to wait for over year just to have the authority recognise the need for her daughter to have an education and health assessment and after that she have be wait over two year for the assessment to take place every day in the meantime she have to go through the heartbreak of see her daughter struggle in school that be do everything it can to support she but be be set up to fail the courage show by all these family and the determination they have show in the face of adversity should give all of we encouragement and hope for the future but they can not be expect to build that well future alone they need their representative to speak up for they in this place and they need the government to act for they with the urgency that these challenge demand because every hour margaret spend wait on that phone line fill with anxiety be an hour that she be never get back because every holiday cancel and every opportunity forgone by steven family be childhood memory that will never be make every day that sarah daughter go to school and be unable to thrive be day potential that will be forever have be waste this be an urgency that feel deeply and that pledge to carry with every day that be lucky enough to serve my constituent in this house at time when global and national challenge can be so wide range as to feel almost insurmountable it be so important that our politician remain bold in keep hope alive at time when actor seek to exploit divisive and thorny issue to sow division among our community we need our politician to stay principled and act with the integrity and good faith this house demand at time when the disruptive opportunity pose by the green transition and technological development also bring with they understandable anxiety we need our politician not to run away from they but to be bold in bend those force to the need of our community and seize their benefit for our country be under no illusion that will face great challenge in live up to these principle in this place but my door will always be open to anyone from right across the chamber who be willing to work with and not just because of the number of time over the last few week that have manage to lock myself out of my office to those back home in mid bedfordshire would like to say thank you thank you for the positivity and warmth you show every day on the campaign trail thank you for the idea and creativity you bring to every month that fill with such hope for the future but most of all thank you for the privilege of my life the opportunity to serve you here as our mp warmly commend the hon member for mid bedfordshire alistair strathern on what think be an excellent maiden speech the movement have funny way of deliver its end these day but think it have come up with an excellent candidate in he and wish he an enjoyable career in this place and serve his constituent as he rightly say it be the privilege of one life to represent where you grow up and know he be obviously very aware of that and give that we have all have the opportunity to enjoy mid bedfordshire at length over recent month share his diagnosis of its charm it be an absolute privilege to open the back bench speech this afternoon on the main topic of our debate because my community like the hon gentleman be also look for change on teesside we need no lesson about the legacy of the last labour government frankly we have have to live with they for too long an industrial base abandon life blight by welfarism and low unemployment and public service characterise by mediocrity and failure this come the week after british steel announce that steelmaking be come back to teesside which be decision of huge significance for my local economy and follow string of major success from the seah offshore wind factory the new net zero teesside power station and carbon capture and storage all the thing that our mayor ben houchen work together in lockstep with the conservative government be help to deliver for part of the country that need this success and opportunity look forward to the autumn statement this week and welcome the chief secretary to the treasury my hon friend the member for sevenoaks laura trott to her position in my former bailiwick as chief secretary the autumn statement represent an enormously important moment and all of we on the government side of the house at least want to see pro growth measure the lowering of the tax burden when possible and robust commitment not to take we back to the disastrous economic prescription of the labour party we have to recognise that it be at time of global challenge here at home that we have some of the most important policy lever to improve our constituent life warmly welcome the government commitment to act on leasehold and renter reform but also believe that we need to recognise the need in the housing sector for serious sustain reconsideration of our planning law if we be to ensure that the potential of this country be fulfil ultimately the honest truth be that we need to earn growth and not duck the fundamental reason why it be so lacklustre many of we be aghast at the decision last week to block new much need billion datacentre on the site of an old quarry adjacent to the it be block on the basis that it would harm the openness of the green belt and would have be visible from bridge over the motorway this be madness we can delude ourselves all we want about be science superpower or new silicon valley but if we do not will the mean we will not secure the end that this country need to see our crippling lack of predictable secure land supply be testament to wide political failure that apply on cross party basis ultimately one could point the finger at the mayor of london and his dismal record on housing just as much as one could at my own side of the house but we need to move forward on cross party basis at local and national government level to achieve well system of planning ultimately the current discretionary system be not deliver for my constituent or for my country and believe that move as the growth commission have suggest this morning to zonal planning system along the line suggest by my right hon friend boris johnson when he be prime minister and by my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick when he be secretary of state would be the right thing to do schroders have estimate that house price be at their least affordable compare with earning since that be not the long hot summer of but the year victoria become empress of india all our infrastructure capacity be be hamstring by the underlying problem that we can not build quickly enough where we need to road rail datum energy and most of all good affordable home be be delay make more expensive and in some case be prevent entirely by this british disease apart from the usual westminster knockabout that debate like this inevitably engender think there be serious point for member across the house to consider which be that there be broken planning system at the heart of our society whether in central bedfordshire or in middlesbrough we need to do more to make sure we can unlock growth job home and opportunity our politic deserve well and the public deserve well this be not right versus left issue it be about growth versus stagnation prosperity versus poverty or ambition versus relative decline hope that over the month ahead the government will do much to take forward an ambitious agenda in this space pay tribute to the outstanding speech by my hon friend the member for mid bedfordshire alistair strathern it be one of the very good maiden speech have hear in this house it have humour and seriousness he succinctly describe his predecessor in couple of sentence and in one sentence he demonstrate his superior knowledge of football compare with the foreign secretary many people watch across the country will now be reflect if that be the quality of representative we could get by vote for change perhaps we will give it go at the next general election too housing be not mention in the king speech we have housing crisis in this country and both side of the house share an aspiration to build home year agree with the right hon member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland sir simon clarke that we be not build enough home that be true but who have just change the planning system to take away housing target from local area we will never get to unless each area have its own housing target that add up to that number further problem be that we will never hit through the private sector alone the housing communities and local government committee produce report four year ago say that we need to provide at least unit of social housing through housing association and council the levelling up housing and communities committee be hold an inquiry now and all the evidence show that we simply do not have the resource there be challenge for both front benches we will have to find more money at some point to build more social housing in this country both to get the number we need and to get the number that people can afford as people can not afford to go into the market to buy in the current circumstance so many people have to save for year even beyond retirement for deposit on home rise mortgage cost be certainly not help there be promise to abolish section notice in the private rented sector but we be now tell the bill will wait until some future time we do not know when when the court system have be reform yes the court system need to be reform and we ought to have dedicated housing court but the cost to local authority of deal with homelessness and temporary accommodation have rise by in the last two year alone that be due to section notice the local housing allowance freeze many people can not afford even to rent home in the private sector and the government asylum policy which be all over the place and be put great pressure on local authority in some part of the country to house people while they be have their asylum position confirm we have massive challenge and there be nothing in the king speech to deal with it we ought to address how we build home for the future four year ago the government have work party on modern construction method but they have forget about it they have give up go to visit lighthouse firm in my constituency that have just take on worker the firm have double in size and be venture into modern method of construction for social housing the government should be encouraging that at national level but there be nothing at all there be no policy no strategy and no plan for the future level up be not mention in the king speech either germany see the inequality across the country after reunification so it have year programme the inequality in this country be now as great as it be in germany on reunification yet all we have have be billion in scatter pot of money for local authority to bid for there be no strategy and no long term solution level up again appear to have be forget but if we be to get our economy grow as whole we have to address the disparity in gross value add productivity and income level between different part of the country productivity in the north of england be now low than in the czech republic gva in our major city be low than the national average which be completely different from what happen in germany and france we need to get the whole country and the whole economy grow but again there be no plan no strategy and no long term future for this country there be one or two good thing in the king speech and welcome they we have not yet see the detail of the leasehold reform but certainly stop the building of new leasehold house and allow people more easily to purchase their freehold be good measure that we need to implement as soon as possible address the problem of service charge and outrageous permission fee also need to be in the bill also welcome the proposal on football regulation it be about get fairer distribution of funding and give fan the legal right to be consult on important thing that affect their club again we will have to see the detail finally completely condemn hamas attack on innocent israeli citizen but condemn just as strongly what israel be now do the killing of innocent woman child and other civilian in gaza be not acceptable and can not continue as it be want to see humanitarian pause and an end to the blockade to get aid into gaza and want to see that as the basis for ceasefire ceasefire can not just be announce both party need to sit down and agree to one that have to be do and it have to be step stone to move forward to two state solution safety for israel and free palestine free of israeli occupation that be what we should be move towards also welcome my hon friend the member for sevenoaks laura trott to her new post her promotion be richly deserve one thing on which be sure we can all agree in this house be the need to create non inflationary growth in this country the question be how we go about it and to some extent how we define it say to my hon friend that gross domestic product as measure of growth be become an increasingly less relevant index in our economy because although economic growth have be low across the western economy balance sheet and net worth have triple there be dislocation there gdp need to take domestic unpaid labour such as child or elderly care into account it exclude huge proportion of what happen online as well as intangible such as intellectual property and be much less suited to service economy than to manufacture economy it also have the perverse incentive of make we want to encourage immigration rather than discourage it when we have the wrong analysis we be likely to have the wrong target and ultimately the wrong policy that need to change we need to concentrate on wealth creation which happen when we take unique ip from any of we and turn it into good or service that do not currently exist or into well good or service than exist today we have problem that in capitalist economy we can not get that sort of wealth creation if there be not sufficient access to capital one problem in the uk be that of company scale up here be do with bank lending and be do with private equity whereas it be in the other direction in the united states we need to have deep and wide access to private equity and venture capital in this country if we be to maximise the benefit of our hugely creative and innovative population and if we be to stop the ip leakage especially to the united states we also need to create more wealth by improve our share of global trade by which mean the share of global market that be expand fast and not our obsession with the european union the late institute of economic affairs report show that trade continue to grow between and the conclusion of the brexit transition in indicate that brexit have no main effect on trade uk good export rise by to eu country and by to non eu country between and so we need to put that issue behind we and instead focus on the world grow market the office for budget responsibility forecast say that brexit barrier would result in drop in trade volume contribute to low gdp in the long run and that be already clearly wrong ask those on the government front bench to request from the obr much more updated and realistic assessment of where our trade sit at the present time contrary to what many people will perceive and certainly to what the labour party will tend to suggest of all the job in this country be in the private sector and only be in the public sector from listen to our medium and politician we would often think this be some of those private sector job be in small and medium sized enterprise know that if we be able to cut taxis many of my colleague will want to see personal taxis cut but our priority should be to cut taxis for small business because they be the one that create prosperity and employment they be the mainstay of our economy in particular would like to see more government action on late payment particularly by local authority this be taxpayer money that should be get through to sme on time and the fact that it be not be scandal would also like to see the retail hospitality and leisure business rate discount extend to give many of the company struggle in that sector the help they require we also need to look at other element include the broadband infrastructure in our country constituency like mine still contain place with no broadband it be ridiculous that we be put public money into the programme and yet leave part of our economy without any of the advantage they require to participate fully in our economy we be tell that we would get that broadband at the end of and then we be tell it would be in spring it be then to be october and now we have no idea when we will get it say to the minister that the treasury need to give kick up the proverbial to other departments to make sure they be carry out the promise that the government make at the last election to stop some of the limitation in the rural economy and to get that infrastructure in place finally want to say quick word about the bank of england it have operational independence but where be the accountability we be tell that inflation would be transitory and that there be external influence involve look at the letter between the governor of the bank of england and the chancellor and not once do they mention monetary stability or the fact that we have have an expansion of our money supply for far too long at far too great level these be not round error if we get extra inflation create by monetary expansion that be too fast it will affect the poor in our society and the balance of our public finance and it will cost taxpayer money have no problem with the bank of england have operational independence but what want to know be when it get it wrong who be it accountable to ultimately it be the taxpayer and the people of this country who pay the bill not those who be well pay in the bank of england after tortuous year the policy programme in the king speech reaffirm once more that this conservative government be out of idea and out of time unfortunately the resurrection of former prime minister will not save they here give lord cameron disregard for standard in public life which include dubious dealing during the covid pandemic on behalf of lex greensill who be still be investigate by the serious fraud office it say lot that the prime minister be prepared to appoint he despite that the prime minister need to take responsibility for the consequence of year of regressive economic policy and economic mismanagement which have lead to flatline economy and the misery that so many people be face in this cost of living crisis over the past year we have see inequality widen as covid have so cruelly expose and amplify once again we have see the north south health divide reveal with more covid death in the north than in the rest of england some here will recall the black report in which be quickly follow by the health divide report in where for the first time the extent of the north south health divide be reveal some year on the same thing have be allow to happen again under yet more conservative government it do not just happen professor sir michael marmot warn we about this in and early in his various report about the uk decline life expectancy which be drive by socioeconomic inequality he make very sensible recommendation to address the situation but again where be those in this king speech worryingly recent analysis find that deprived area in the north of england have high level of covid death compare with an equally deprive area in the south there be an amplification of deprivation effect contrary to level up the country this government have not learn any lesson from covid and why the north be bad affect than the south or why people on the low income those who be disabled and those who be from an ethnic minority community be more likely to get sick and die as the northern health science alliance recent report show the implication of these regional health inequality on the economy be vast before the pandemic people in the north be live on average two year less than people in the rest of england in addition to live short life they be live in poor health for long be at increase risk of lose their job because of that ill health and be put on low wage if and when they return to work the nhsa estimate that billion year would be add to regional gdp if the health of the population in the north be equivalent to that of the rest of england as result of improved productivity the disproportionate ill health that people experience in the north reflect decade of under investment there after the decline of many traditional industry the ensue poverty and inequality that accompany that and the fact that this have persist over many generation where be the cross departmental working to ensure health in all policy in the king speech where be the join up work with the devolved nation and region where be the fair funding formulae not just for the nhs but for education local authority and public service as whole economic inactivity across the uk have stay at about for number of year with short blip in with covid the government response to that should not be to penalise people who be sick or disabled by withdraw even more social security support for example through sanction or cut to universal credit as be report yesterday but to provide the right type of support for people in the right way be call on the chancellor to ensure that he increase social security support by at least inflation also hope he listen to the many charity in this area include the joseph rowntree foundation the trussell trust and the child poverty action group and support an essential guarantee peg uc to the cost of basic essential without that fear that the claimant death that the department for work and pensions have investigate over the past three year which we know be the tip of the iceberg will increase the prime minister say he want to lead compassionate government ensure compassionate social security system that will help to reduce the poverty and inequality that million be experience be just one example of how he can do that the absence of this compassion for our fellow citizen and indeed for our brother and sister overseas be reveal uncomfortable truth about the attitude of some to our common humanity we believe that as human being we be all equal with equal right as set out in the universal declaration of human right it be evident not just in the covid inquiry but every day in foreign and domestic policy and in the policy programme in this king speech which embed rather than tackle inequality that for this government some people be more equal than other it be pleasure and an honour to contribute to the debate congratulate his majesty on deliver the king speech last week follow in the footstep of his late great mother and undertake his constitutional duty to parliament and our country also wish he happy birthday today with the autumn statement just eight day away it be clear that we need to see ambitious fiscal measure introduce to complement the economic growth provision outline in the king speech tackle inflation have rightly be one of the government priority we understand the corrosive effect of inflation on the economy economic growth and household around the country we need the rate to fall far to manageable level but we must also increase supply through reform and low business cost to ultimately help bring down inflation there be many measure would like to touch on in the time have available one which speak about early this year be the reduction in fuel duty that the chancellor maintain in the spring which be incredibly welcome such measure be essential as they can make huge difference to household and business across the country against an inflationary backdrop although we know it be decrease this matter because it help to bring cost down across the whole economy and importantly can help business and motorist say that as an mp from essex where we be proud of white van man and where driver come into london in particular let we not forget that there be other pressure on motorist in london because of the additional burden they now face such as the ultra low emission zone alongside that there be the issue of business rate which often speak about they be fixed cost to business but actually impede growth on our high street as we know our high street and town centre be struggle for many reason if address in consider way by government freeze in the business rate multiplier can help small business and firm to keep their cost down press the government to maintain the freeze in the multipli and look at reform to lower the cost burden of business rate which be have such corrosive impact some of my constituent be employ by sme which be high than the national average we be very proud of that essex be an entrepreneurial county and we be risk taker we like run our own business and be self employ but that mean that the share of the burden on those small business be much high as conservative in government we must always look to tackle that to return to my other favourite subject the government be aware of my concern about the oecd plan for minimum level of corporation tax and the way the government be roll they out fundamentally maintain the position have take on this issue and the chancellor of the exchequer have give assurance over the assessment and analysis that will be carry out of its impact we touch on this during discussion about the finance no act but those measure will make our country less competitive they will have an overall impact on business foreign direct investment and investment in our country so will want to press ministers on the review of they go forward also maintain my position on income tax the tax system need to be simplify and fair and we need to reduce the burden on family and business include level of personal taxation one of the core mission of the conservative party be to support economic freedom and liberty by cut taxis ensure people can keep more of what they earn and encourage the development of property own democracy which have be topic of discussion in the chamber this afternoon universally we in this chamber know we need reform on planning and that we need to do more on social housing as well as grow housing across the country in sustainable and suitable way people be struggle and the cost of own property or even get foot on the housing ladder be astronomical so we need to do more could go on to other statistic but in the interest of time will raise another couple of local issue in essex we be cry out for infrastructure investment will happily write business case to the treasury on dualle the and expand the we have have tremendously successful programme of investment on the great eastern main line because of business case that go to the treasury year ago we be proud of that and that growth be now pay off want to press the case on pylon and the winser review in essex we have concern which the treasury must listen to about the implication of the review support the wide measure on energy production and the introduction of the offshore petroleum licensing bill but more need to be do to conclude welcome the framework of measure but we have to look at the detail on support supply side reform lower taxis for business make sure our economy grow in sustainable way and deal with the challenge of inflation so that we ensure our economy grow for decade to come the king speech open with an aspiration to raise economic growth but be devoid of single clue to how the government intend to achieve that there be nothing about skill development strategy nothing to address decline apprenticeship number for to year old and nothing on the investment require to get britain work again the chancellor now want we to believe that all will be put right in the autumn statement methink we go to need big statement the government foist brexit on we without plan to implement it so what do the prime minister do in his hour of need he bring back the planless man whose reckless behaviour cause so much difficulty it be like oliver hardy ask stanley for help at inflation be still long way from the target with little evidence that government action rather than commodity price reduction be account for the limited progress that we have see in fact the interest rate rise force on the bank of england be more likely to damage business and living standard increase mortgage will cost uk household billion over this year and next how will we raise economic growth with government who can not even secure our ability to produce our own steel some job be at risk in scunthorpe while the government do nothing just how safe and secure should anyone feel with government who have entrust our steelmaking to the chinese last year this country experience what happen when government speculate with unfunded tax plan there be always price to pay when gambler lose control but it be the british people who be pay that price with wrecked living standard the behaviour of the conservative party have destroy the prospect of family the length and breadth of this country when will the government take responsibility for the misery that they have cause this be government of tax rise but what do we have to show for it we have crumble school an nhs on its knee crime out of control living standard plummet and even life expectancy fall in century tory britain the truth be that virtually nothing work anymore there be hardly family in the land apart from the covid profiteer who can claim to be well off than they be year ago just think what we could do with the estimate billion of fraudulent covid payment over which this prime minister preside and which this government be prepared to write off lest it appear that think there be nothing of benefit in this king speech welcome action to curtail drip pricing and subscription trap which hope will eventually be deliver via the digital markets competition and consumers bill it be long overdue it be time that online business pay their fair share of taxis it be time to breathe new life into our high street by abandon outdated business rate and say this in respect for shopworkers week crack down on retail crime which accord to new research from thruvision and retail economics will reach billion this year it be turn shop into dangerous work environment and no go area for too many customer let we think of the possibility for job growth and wealth creation in life science creative industry the green economy and financial service if only we have government who know the value of an industrial strategy and be prepared to secure the necessary investment instead we have government who make we laugh stock over their inability to build modern railway and manage to let end up billion over budget just who will be call to account for that incompetence want to be able to offer hope to the brilliant kath café in druids heath as it struggle with increase supply cost and customer decline living standard to cameron price great local manufacturing business that be toil to find the skilled worker it need and to loaf organic bakery popular and entrepreneurial venture but without any government support in the face of crippling electricity cost we need king speech to offer hope to the homeless to support well pay job to tackle the mental health crisis and to address the gang and the scourge of antisocial behaviour disfigure our community we need king speech to get britain work again this be not it warmly welcome my hon friend the chief secretary to her new position last week we be all allow to see the historic spectacle of the king give his first speech to this house there be many historic spectacle associate with the speech and today entertainingly the shadow chancellor play her role which be to claim that nothing have ever go right with the government and that there be nothing in the king speech at all of course on bald number the shadow chancellor be wrong because it be clear that since the uk have have the third high growth in the and million more people be employ however that do not mean that growth should not be priority especially give the long term shock this economy have have from covid and the current crisis in ukraine although that seem to be forget at the moment cause other energy shock it be therefore encouraging that the preoccupation of the king speech and of this government be to promote economic growth it be right to start by talk about support the bank of england in take measure that will reduce inflation inflation be economically corrosive and it be the job of government to be financially responsible when inflation be stable at low level we see the encouragement of personal saving which be benefit we see less pressure for people from what be describe as the cost of living and we see business invest it reduce some of the inefficiency that economist talk about and rigidity in the economy it be key that we take measure and encourage the bank of england to bring down inflation in order to have high growth one such measure be to ensure that for the next part of the century we look at the industry that both the government and the private sector can foster so that we see sustained economic growth the united kingdom have the chance to be the world leader in many high tech industry the shadow chancellor be right to welcome what the government do in the spring statement with expensing it be the right thing to do because it encourage business to invest however we can make it permanent only if we do away with some of the grant and take other action to make it fiscally neutral and it be of more benefit if it do not go only into plant and machinery urge the government to look at system that allow research intensive industry to put research and development cost into full expensing as well the industry of the future be mention in the king speech welcome the measure that we will see and discuss in the digital markets competition and consumers bill and the data protection and digital information bill another industry of the future in which we must ensure that we remain world leader have be world leader in it for the last year be the car industry we must do more to encourage the electric vehicle industry there be some simple measure that the government could enact to encourage more people to take up electric vehicle the first be the stabilisation and equalisation of vat so that people charge their vehicle in public or private place pay the same rate the second be to put presumption on local authority to have byelaw permit safety gullies to allow charge by those who do not have access to their own off street parking those be simple thing that the government will do to encourage growth the government rightly recognise the importance of the quality of infrastructure and get more people to invest in it one thing that be not in the king speech but be be circulate be the new rail reform bill welcome some of the measure in that bill but we will need to look again at it because there be far too much emphasis on what the public sector do and not enough on what the private sector could do it could do more welcome and hope to see more use of initiative such as the mansion house compact encourage the government to think about how first time buyer could use their pension fund to fund deposit use something similar to what we have with self invest personal pension which allow people to take out tax free economic growth for everybody across the world be difficult to achieve at the moment but there be measure in the king speech as have no doubt there will be in next week autumn statement that will allow that growth to prosper welcome the king speech the question that all our constituent be ask be be that it after year be that all this government have to offer this be king speech so pointless that it could be an answer on the game show it come from prime minister who be act like one of the contestant on celebrity get out of to do anything to stay in charge frankly our constituent deserve well many member have speak about the deep seat challenge in our country such as the lack of growth after year of this government we have society in which the bank of mum and dad determine outcome not talent in the last decade alone housing and stock and share have earn far more than any hard work or effort that our constituent could undertake because of sluggish productivity and the government failure to invest in our community our kid can not get apprenticeship they be struggle to stay in university interruption the minister be shake her head invite she to come and meet my local resident who beg for apprenticeship they be still reel from the impact of the pandemic they be scar by where they live and who their parent be because that be what determine their outcome it be mark of shame for we that we live in country in which the exam result of black child be on average almost low than those of their white counterpart nothing be change any time soon and the king speech will do little my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts set out the housing crisis when see the other crisis that we be face suppose should be careful what wish for because when face with the climate crisis the government response be to go hard on fossil fuel rather than recognise that renewable be cheap and that if we be to tackle both the cost of live crisis and the climate crisis we should put those thing together rather than ask our community to choose of course nothing in the king speech deal with the elephant in the room that be brexit be sad that the right hon member for north somerset dr fox be no long in his place after his valiant attempt to claim that brexit have have positive impact on our country and community the economic data suggest otherwise so let give he some other figure eurostat figure show that export have fall by in the last year and that uk to eu trade of good be down european central bank research show that of firm in this country say that the brexit deal be not help their sale indeed our constituent be face surcharge on their food bill alone the king speech could have deal with the fact that in the come year brexit impact on inflation will get lot bad our constituent will face time charge on anything import into the uk food will get more expensive not my word but those of the government own record there will charge to enter the uk what will that do to our stutter tourism industry which be try to recover after the pandemic the king speech be silent on all those challenge and try to suggest that trade through the cptpp will make up for the trade lose on our doorstep the king speech offer criminal justice bill which welcome it be time that we finally sort out the inequality that mean that my walthamstow constituent have few human right when it come to choose to have an abortion than constituent in belfast sentence guideline will not deal with the fact that hundred of woman be now be prosecute under outdated abortion legislation it be time for decriminalisation and perhaps one of the few positive thing we can do in the year to come be to sort that wish to correct the record early say that in the time it have take for the government to fail to do anything about buy now pay later lender the number of people borrow from these company have double it have actually triple forty per cent of people who be borrow from buy now pay later company say they be in direct financial difficulty because of it and these company be benefit from the government failure to regulate they care as much about legal loan shark in the private sector as do about those in the public sector the regulation of these company be long overdue and if this government do not do it wait for labour government to do it will mean another year and another explosion in the million of people borrow from they in the next year we will see crisis in our childcare industry because the government have push up the cost of childcare without provide the subsidy for it we need to go far it be not just about provide high quality childcare it be about help every family to make the choice they want only of dad report take share parental leave because our share parental leave system do not work it ask the mum employer to pay the cost rather than share they some of dad say they do not have enough time with their kid as result these be challenge that we could deal with but this king speech will do nothing to solve they as say public sector legal loan shark need to be deal with too in the next year alone private finance initiative deal will cost this country billion in repayment pfi be something that all government have use and we need to tackle it we have billion worth of commitment come our way money that could be go back into our public service if we fight for well deal for our taxpayer what we be see be small response to big challenge not least to the big challenge of all which be the uncertainty and conflict around the world everybody in this chamber want the bloodshed to stop in israel and gaza everybody in this chamber hope stand with people like my constituent whose parent have be kidnap by hamas and want to see they return and to see the dismantling of hamas as terrorist organisation humanitarian pause would require the same type of negotiation as ceasefire let we stand together with our international partner and put pressure on those partner who can put pressure on hamas to get people round the table let we challenge israel to stand up for international humanitarian law and let we stop the bloodshed this king speech do nothing to achieve that but it could have do be grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate on the king speech it be poignant to attend the house of lords last week to hear his majesty first king speech it be perhaps appropriate that this debate take place on charles iii birthday and we all wish he very happy day indeed at the beginning of this parliament almost four year ago do not think anyone could have predict the event that would unfold after just few month with the global pandemic it be quite remarkable and not by accident that the uk economy have have one of the fast and strong recovery of any in europe include germany and france and elsewhere in the world include japan welcome the investment of over billion year in research and development it be no accident that this country be decarbonise and reach our net zero carbon emission goal more than any other country in the welcome the trade comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership bill which be announce in the king speech yesterday evening the new zealand high commissioner be here in parliament welcome the trans pacific partnership which truly be demonstration of global britain and global reach post brexit we be an island trading nation and that be why economic growth have to be support by thriving british aviation sector it have suffer hugely as result of the pandemic but be come back extremely strongly be delighted that later this month virgin atlantic airways which be headquarter in my constituency will be fly the first ever sustainable aviation fuel fight transatlantic from london to new york however we need to do more to support the sustainable aviation fuel industry which have the potential to create over job in this country it be well for our economic and energy security to produce saf here in the united kingdom than to be reliant on import it from abroad with all the expense involve another area in which we could boost our economic growth would be to use brexit freedom to introduce duty free shopping on arrival most of the rest of the world do so part of europe that be not in the european union have introduce duty free shopping include norway and switzerland as have many other country around the world it be freedom that we should be use it would not cost the treasury any lose revenue but it would onshore those sale to uk shop and create employment turn to animal welfare issue very much welcome the livestock export bill live animal export for slaughter and fattening have not take place for number of year but certainly in the past that be an extremely cruel practice that cause great distress to animal who be traffic over long distance to meet very sad end it be very good that that practice will come to an end in law so that it can no long take place that be another brexit animal welfare benefit and something that my late mum would have be very pleased about many year ago she often use to write to her local mp call for an end to live animal export it be great that that be now be achieve finally manifesto commitment that the conservative party make four year ago and that feature in most of the main party political manifesto be the banning of trophy hunting import the import of endangered species body part into great britain in the last session table such ban in the form of private member bill but unfortunately that bill be filibuster block and eventually time out by very small number of peer one of they hereditary peer in the other place the ban pass this elect house unanimously have widespread public support and be government commitment if the minister want to intervene on to say that the government will bring forward that legislation in this session would be delighted understand that she probably do not have that brief in front of she but hopefully the government can confirm that they will legislate in government time to achieve that manifesto commitment end what be very cruel practice and lead the world far in animal welfare measure it be pleasure to speak in this king speech debate on secure economic growth only wish the government have offer we something in his majesty gracious speech that would turn that vision into reality this conservative government have wreck the economy and they continue to make everyone else pay for it they have give tax break to big bank and the oil and gas giant while the rest of we have suffer high taxis high mortgage bill and spiral inflation the king speech reveal government with absolutely no interest in tackle the cost of living crisis there be nothing to address food price inflation nor to support struggle household with their soar mortgage payment and it ignore the need to protect the most vulnerable from high energy bill this winter if there be one thing that all part of the political spectrum can agree on it be that the uk need to grow its economy under the conservatives so much of the uk potential be go untapped with anaemic growth weak investment and fall living standard year of stagnate growth look set to persist with the most recent figure show that our economy have flatline as household budget be squeeze by high interest rate it could not be clear that the government approach have fail unprecedented economic challenge have only be compound by conservative government who have no cohesive economic strategy and who have chop and change time after time perfect example be the prime minister decision to row back on crucial green commitment decision that not only jeopardise our fight against climate change and keep family stick in draughty home pay high energy bill but destroy the certainty that business need to invest in green future it move the goalpost throw into question carefully craft business plan what colossal waste opportunity for the climate green growth and new job and this be yet more proof that this government do not have plan not for our planet or for our economy if the uk be to keep up with our international partner we urgently need to restore business confidence and boost investment in growth industry at the heart of the liberal democrat plan to achieve this be an ambitious industrial strategy which would co ordinate policy across key area and set strategic objective such as supercharge green technology create good local job and boost international trade it would create stability give the private sector clear investment signal and revitalise business condition by equip our workforce with the skill it need invest in key infrastructure encourage the adoption of digital technology and create financial market that truly work for all business yet at every opportunity the government refuse to set clear direction of travel or to implement cohesive long term industrial strategy and this king speech be no different one piece of legislation be pleased to see be the pedicabs london bill and congratulate the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken on all her work in secure this commitment from the government this bill will create regulatory framework for rickshaw while the intention for this legislation may be to control the unruly service that operate in central london believe that rickshaw could be real game changer for those in my constituency and elsewhere who can not access active travel this could be particular benefit as an interim transport solution across hammersmith bridge which have be close to motor traffic for almost five year be pleased to meet the hon member for copeland trudy harrison when she be minister in the department for transport to discuss the potential opportunity for rickshaw in my constituency now that the bill have finally be introduce would welcome further meeting with the department for transport to discuss the possibility for hammersmith bridge and the surround area to run pilot scheme for new licensed pedicab service of the bills offer in this king speech there be not single piece of legislation to tackle the crisis face our nhs and nothing to ensure that the million people on waiting list can access treatment mental health be one of the top issue in my constituency and know that many of my constituent be deeply disappointed that plan to reform the mental health act have seemingly be scrap my constituent be also look to the king speech to provide solution to the sewage crisis pollute our waterway but it completely fail to introduce measure that would stop water company pump sewage into river and ocean and it fail to introduce new tough water regulator to hold water company to account in my constituency of richmond park thames water have become synonymous with poor quality work and dubious environmental practice alongside fail to attend burst water main for day and take week to repair relatively simple issue the company be spend million on project intend to replace water from the river thames near ham and petersham with highly treat sewage in time of drought give the company history of frustrating business practice and an appalling environmental record how be my constituent suppose to trust thames water to do its job how will the government ensure that the agency responsible for monitor thames water have the power need to hold it to account hope that the king on his birthday today have receive some decent gift and be enjoy special day because be afraid that his government have nothing to offer the family and business across the uk that be cry out for change there be no plan for economic growth no plan to protect our natural environment and no plan to tackle the crisis face our nhs this show government that be out of idea and will soon be out of time this afternoon think would revert to my role as one woman tourist board for north devon home to the only cold water surf reserve in the world and the uk only world surf reserve with stunning beach alongside beautiful countryside and magnificent moor there really be something for everyone who want to get bit of the great outdoors hospitality in north devon contribute over quarter of billion pound to the economy indeed our local economy be hugely reliant on our tourism and hospitality sector the pandemic see surge in people enjoy staycation and visit previously unseen part of the uk however this year have see drop in visitor number in part as these visitor head to overseas destination again but the sector be also struggle to recruit staff with many venue open for only part of the week unfortunately drive in part by the huge surge in short term holiday let alongside rush of second home owner have two plea to the treasury to keep the business rate discount as swathe of hospitality business be set to close their door this january if discount be reduce and to reverse the osborne tax reform and level the tax playing field between long term and short term rental to help resolve some of our housing and hence staffing challenge during an economic downturn we all know that eat and drink out be one of the first thing to go so say to those of we in north devon and beyond let we support our local pub and restaurant this winter but fear that there be more at play know from speak to beach manager and surf school that far too many people visit our beautiful beach be fearful of the sea despite eight of the bathing beach in north devon have excellent water quality and be among the clean beach in the world know that that phrase make opposition councillor rush home to write complaint about to the local paper but it be true the so call sewage scandal so love by opposition party be not what be happen to north devon beach yes when it rain lot of the storm overflow run they be mostly rainwater but less than of the water pollution in north devon come from human sewage these overflow have run for more than century we only know about this now because they be monitor in north devon much work have already be do to hold water far up the catchment and to reduce the impact of heavy rain as well as instal extra storage capacity to reduce the frequency of storm discharge yes there be more to do but it be vital to those business along the coast and everyone who want to enjoy our stunning beach to recognise that north devon beach have already undergo huge improvement and the water quality be significantly well than it be year ago indeed even surfers against sewage whose app generate more content in my inbox than anything else concede in write to this month with regard to the beach in your constituency we totally agree that huge improvement have be make to water quality there yes there will always be more to do but wish the opposition party would not talk down north devon lib dems call for sewage to be tackle in the king speech they clearly fail to turn up as they so often do when we pass the environment act which be the reason we be monitor and know where the real problem be anti business rhetoric from lib dems be so damaging in constituency such as mine lib dem council run our big town barnstaple which have very busy high street for whole host of reason not least the great range of fabulous independent retailer alongside big brand name but it be be hold back because the council have not prioritise reopen the bus station have have complaint for over year about the lack of toilet facility and shelter rural bus journey into town be long the council be pay by bus company to run the station but it choose to spend that money on business rate rather than on provide the commercial service that traveller need know that the plan be to sell it to the town council and open community centre which be very lovely but there be local coffee shop owner who be interested in open café why can not we do something more commercial our hospitality sector and indeed virtually every business visit as well as all our public service can not recruit staff because there be nowhere to live for working age family attribute that to the failing of the lib dem run council to get to grip with planning the council officer staff work flat out to deliver the plan that be put together but where be the lib dem vision for barnstaple to thrive and improve its economic output where be the affordable home that we so desperately need yes government money be come to help redevelop the high street and rebuild the hospital and its vital staff accommodation but more commercial thinking be need at local level our lib dem council leader advise the bbc that be electioneer when suggest reopen the bus station fortunately the council staff at the town council recognise the need for bus station as do everyone else talk to we need our business to thrive we need to support they and provide the right associate facility for shopper to make long journey into town take advantage of the government bus fare which be huge saving for long rural journey while work locally to help resolve some of these matter very much hope that more people will contribute to north devon local economic growth if they have not book their next staycation can highly recommend my beautiful constituency north devon be jewel in our country tourism crown and this conservative government will continue to support it not talk it down it be an honour and privilege to represent the people of newcastle upon tyne central it be the city grow up in and quite simply the good place in the world my question in this king speech debate be why be the government let newcastle down replace the woman actually elect to lead his party the prime minister promise to get the economy grow but the imf now forecast that our country will have the low growth in the next year yet taxis be at their high rate since what be my constituent pay for it be not well health service well school or safe street we be pay for tory failure this king speech do nothing to change that suppose it should not be surprising that an old harrovian fail prime minister think the answer be an old etonian fail prime minister but it be not that tory failure will continue in my constituency see it on the doorstep at my surgery and on our street with young people try to get on the housing ladder but hold back by tory britain systemic failure to build we have business contend with inflation as well as the scourge of late payment we have pensioner choose between heating and eat less than half of child in england see dentist in the past year we have supermarket security tag on half pound of butter some of child in my constituency be grow up in poverty of household be in fuel poverty and almost one fifth of adult in newcastle be estimate to be in problematic debt it be little wonder that this year the citizen advice bureau in newcastle be on course to help more people with crisis support food bank referral and charitable support than in any other year on record behind each statistic there be live family one example from newcastle city council cost of live helpline be of an adult with two child the parent have not eat anything for three day save food so that the kid can eat there be no gas and no electricity they be go to warm place in the city to spend the day and wrap up in multiple layer at night that be impact on the mental health of everyone in the family this be newcastle in under the tories this be the human cost of tory economic chaos be immensely proud of our local food bank such as west end food bank newcastle united supporter trust food bank and kenton food bank be proud of the work of our council and be proud of the work of all the charity help geordies to survive but it should not have to be this way newcastle wonderful industrial heritage inspire to go into engineering whether it be renewable energy life science start up or innovative manufacturing newcastle have exciting prospect for the industry of the future and green industrial manufacturing future in our long stand area of strength such as our world renowne hospitality sector which add more than million of gva each year in my constituency can see enormous potential for growth help by labour plan on business rate energy market and the planning system labour have plan to make people across the whole country well off by grow the economy boost wage and bring down bill our industrial strategy would bring together our excellent university skilled workforce and deep capital market to turbocharge growth in constituency such as mine our planning reform would make it possible to build the infrastructure we need and switch on great british energy would bring down bill create hundred of thousand of high pay job and put the uk on course towards energy independence the record speak for itself people in newcastle upon tyne central would be well off with labour under the tories disposable income be forecast to grow by just between and under labour it grow by per person the tories low growth high tax economy have mean hardship and setback for my constituent we need labour government and labour king speech to restore pride and purpose to our country and to give newcastle upon tyne central and the whole country our future back it be pleasure to follow the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central chi onwurah as we debate long term economic growth in all part of the united kingdom can not help but address sentiment that have long linger in the heart of many in north east wales and my constituency it often feel as though we be bit invisible and forget by both westminster and cardiff bay and as constituency we long for our voice to be hear and our potential to be unleash it be essential that both the uk and welsh government acknowledge the challenge face by region like our and respond with tailor policy and investment we need infrastructure development improve access to education and skill training and target support for local business and industry only through those measure can we unlock the true potential of the region that have be overlook for far too long across my home county of flintshire resident in all town and village see investment from the welsh government go into south wales they watch the news and see the uk government invest in the north east of england and they yell at their tv screen what about the north east of wales we must strive for future not where prosperity be confine to select few or to constituency where government of whatever colour want to shore up support with investment but where instead prosperity flow to every corner of the country empower individual family and community to thrive with that in mind will first touch on the exciting opportunity that lie within the heart of region the flintshire and wrexham investment zone bid this collaborative endeavour hold immense importance and significance to both area as they join force to unlock their true potential and pave the way for bright future not only do the local authority collaborative working call for praise the manner in which the bid be be spearhead by local industry and partnership especially the fabulous joanna swash from moneypenny in wrexham who be chair the bid show exactly what can be achieve when framework be put in place that business can take advantage of the impact of the investment zone bid may be transformative to the region not only by generate direct employment but by create ripple effect create opportunity foster entrepreneurship and drive economic growth in industry and supply chain across the region we should embrace the bid which support wholeheartedly as the zone will mean that we can all witness the remarkable transformation that await both flintshire and wrexham secondly devolution be hold back wales every week we have hear it several time today opposition member shout thing like you ve have year and it just get bad politely ask they to reflect on how labour have be in power in wales for year and outcome be bad in almost every measurable way in average income in wales and scotland be almost identical in wales find itself with income low than our northern british friend it have become clear for multitude of reason that power must be take back into hand of the uk government and shall table bill to allow referendum to take place to get rid of devolution in wales as soon the parliamentary schedule allow return power to westminster do not mean abandon the unique identity and cultural heritage of wales on the contrary it would allow for more cohesive approach to governance with decision make in the good interest of all citizen in mind rather than just those south of welshpool in fact when that be put to the first minister of wales at the welsh affairs committee recently he do not even try to deny that that be happen we must get back to focus on outcome rather than process it do not matter where decision be make or who make they what matter be that they be the right one people currently trundle to work at mph in wales down road that be full of hole and crumble because the welsh government will not repair they or build any new one know that it be the outcome that matter not the process devolution in wales have be resounding failure the welsh government have prove incapable of deliver on its promise leave our nation lag behind in critical area it be time to recognise the shortcoming of devolution and take the necessary step to rectify the situation for the good of everyone in wales the core principle of conservatism call for reduce taxation remove regulatory burden increase empowerment increase entrepreneurship and opportunity and community collaboration it be time to shift our focus towards empower individual restore personal responsibility and minimise state interference in people life that include remove superfluous level of government that add nothing to the life of the people we be here to serve the way this government run the economy do not work for the vast majority of people who live in scotland or for those across the uk it be frankly disgrace that so many of my constituent who live in the energy rich country of scotland can not afford to pay their energy bill let there be no doubt about it the fault lie at the door of the uk government in scotland and across the uk record number of people be struggle to afford food energy and housing yet there be glaring omission of any tangible policy to help struggle household in the king speech people in scotland have so far be cushion from the full impact of westminster policy by scottish government action but no amount of scottish government action can fully protect people in scotland from regressive westminster policy macroeconomic power and the real power to transform our society still lie in westminster the scottish parliament be only devolved parliament it do not have the power to truly transform scotland economy and society that would come only with independence and that be why support independence be here to scrutinise this government climate change and the cost of living crisis be the two big challenge we face in scotland and across the uk the failure to include any meaningful action to tackle they in the king speech be gross dereliction of duty with vision and green new deal this government could tackle both the climate and the cost of live crisis and transform the way our economy work to benefit all our constituent but they have neither the desire nor the inclination to do so we have hear much about oil licence but oil from the rosebank oilfield will not increase energy security for the uk nor will it lower energy bill for my constituent it will be sell on the international market and we will have to buy it at the same price as everyone else it will make equinor and ithaca lot of money but uk taxpayer will pay for it as jess ralston from the energy and climate intelligence unit say it be clear that this prime minister would rather give tax break to oil company than low energy bill taxpayer across the uk will fork out around billion to the developer of the oilfield money that could have be use to insulate million of home many of which be set to be colder and poorer this winter the uk government do not even attach any net zero carbon condition to the new oilfield wonder whether they plan to do so for the promise future licensing the uk government new find enthusiasm for drill oil and gas in the north sea tell we that scottish voter be lie to during the independence referendum when unionists from both the conservative and the labour party say that the oil in the north sea be about to run out why should people in scotland trust anything either of they say ever again while the uk government continue to sell off the energy in the north sea to the high bidder there be no meaningful plan for the much promise just transition that be why scotland and indeed the uk need green new deal that phrase be first coin in the united states and the biden administration have go some way to put green new deal into action with an industrial strategy that involve the world most generous package of climate incentive under the inflation reduction act in scotland the common weal policy think tank have produce some excellent work on what green new deal would look like for my country during the pandemic it produce blueprint for comprehensive green new deal for scotland which would involve process of public planning organise and implement by public body and pay for out of the public purse it would be whole new scheme for scotland energy agriculture and housing with huge benefit of employment prosperity and skill it be plan not just for our environment but for our economy and society green new deal might work by tackle the problem of the cold draughty home in which many of our constituent live we need to insulate and retrofit they and we could do that if we supercharge our construction industry that could be combine with programme of transformative land reform to allow for reforest to produce the wood need for construction work reforestation do properly would also assist carbon capture and expand biodiversity once building be properly insulate they could be heat by district heating system provide by combination of solar thermal and geothermal system we could also use inter seasonal heat storage to store heat from the summer for use in winter all of that cost less and could feed into the grid much more quickly than new nuclear power it would be huge engineering feat but other country have manage it and it could create well pay job the uk covid inquiry have hear evidence about how during the pandemic privileged government figure could not comprehend the life of the people for whom they be make decision the prime minister the foreign secretary and the chancellor be all rich man how can they possibly understand the life of the people meet week in week out at my constituency surgery who be struggle to pay for basic necessity we will not get sustainable economic growth for everyone until we tackle climate change energy insecurity and the cost of living crisis the king speech be just another miss opportunity to do that it be pleasure to speak in this debate the first king speech in over year outline the government commitment to deliver for the british people include the people of stoke on trent we have government focus on deliver for the whole country and city like stoke on trent thank to level up and of course thank to brexit be glad that the topic of the debate today reflect that understanding those beyond london must benefit from growth and we must no long be leave behind after decade of decline under labour stoke on trent fortune have revive our iconic industry ceramic give our city its sense of place as the potteries and our sense of purpose as local centre of world class manufacturing for the global market provide that free trade be rule base particularly against outrageous dumping our ceramics industry have much to gain from the trade bill that include manufacturer of advanced technical and industrial ceramic upon which our future industry depend we need to help our fantastic business in north staffordshire to trade right around the world more of the amazing product that we produce it be also vital that we far support energy intensive sector which provide important skilled job measure to address energy security be welcome but further support be need alongside number of colleague have recently write to the chancellor to express the importance of support the ceramics sector with energy cost and not apply too rigid net zero policy when technology be yet to offer viable alternative if we do not get this right it risk offshore an industry to country that have far bad environmental and human right record digital industry be also increasingly important in stoke on trent as we emerge as lead hub for gaming indeed our industrial heritage building be be repurpose for game industry disruptor who appreciate and feed creatively from those building in all their quirky and authentic glory accord to ofcom gigabit full fibre connectivity in stoke on trent enable download that be time fast and upload that be time fast than the uk average so welcome the digital markets competition and consumers bill which will safeguard small and disruptor firm from any egregious behaviour by big player the government have be extremely generous in provide investment through the transform city fund level up fund heritage action zone and more our town centre and high street however need further investment and it remain disappointing that stoke on trent have miss out previously on future high street funding town deal funding and the late round of funding for town which do not include single town in the whole of staffordshire encourage the government to do more to help our high street across north staffordshire with planning reform and of course investment more funding be always welcome but we also need the city council network rail and other to get on with actually deliver thing it be concern that the labour council have already revert to type roll back on level up scheme lack entirely the ambitious leadership our city need we also see lack of ambition when it come to our local public transport yes we need to improve bus service and we be deliver that through bus service improvement funding but rail improvement be also vital to our city and should not be flippantly dismiss as we have see labour do locally only rail can provide rapid alternative to car reduce road congestion and improve air quality for all fortunately the government have have the wisdom to see that phase of fail to deliver good value for staffordshire it would have mean all the pain with no gain the billion release be now available for local scheme that will make real difference the reopening of meir station and the stoke to leek line include station at fenton manor must now be fast track and deliver meir have some of the bad transport deprivation in the country by bus it can take up to an hour to reach the university the college and the main station reopen meir station will put those destination reliably within minute by rail and that will level up many more life chance locally than could ever achieve we also need to make rapid progress with lift at longton station and develop plan for station to serve trentham level up our city transport infrastructure so that it be back where it should be be the sure way of level up its potential as place to live work and visit the inclusion in the king speech of draft rail reform bill be welcome not least because great british railways will be base in derby and suspect that nothing will increase the chance of improve service on the crewe derby nottingham line through stoke on trent quite as much as have gbr on it we particularly need to increase the frequency of train on that line to two an hour for too long east west rail link like this have be dismiss however also look forward to investment in the local element of the national road infrastructure work investment in junction of the and the corridor for instance be long overdue the foundation for our success as grow city in grow national economy will lie in ensure that it be safe place to be safe from crime and antisocial behaviour safe from the scourge of monkey dust and safe from the most heinous criminal offender therefore welcome the criminal justice bill the victims and prisoners bill and the terrorism bill for the part that they will play in keep we safe it be pleasure to speak in today debate on the king speech believe that his majesty be visit food poverty project today it be marvellous to see our monarch and head of state take more interest in food poverty than our government it be notable that the king speech fall during uk parliament week last week meet many of the uniformed youth organisation and many child from school across my constituency who have numerous question to ask about the king speech and the process that we have here in parliament one of they ask how man in gold hat could sit on gold chair and talk seriously about cost of live crisis but that think might not be the spirit in which to enter this debate so instead will raise some issue about democracy because do not think we talk enough about it in this democratically elect chamber uk parliament week should have give we an opportunity to talk seriously about democracy and about the need to ensure that the public feel they have say in what we do in this place one of the great way in which we do that be through the public petition system as chair of the petitions committee feel that must raise the fact that action have be promise in the king speech on two public petition that gain huge support across the house but that action be very much missing the first which ask for pet theft to be make specific offence have widespread support in the house but huge support among the public many of whom see pet as very much member of the family give that we be nation of animal lover know bill on the subject would also have huge support in the house and think it cry shame that it be miss from the king speech the other petition concern the banning of conversion therapy it be horrible thing and think the word therapy be very misleading the petition have cross party support and have receive huge amount of support from member of the public when there have be petition on the subject ask the government to think again about find time to legislate for change that have cros party support and more importantly huge public support there be nothing in the king speech about housing and housing shortage have be meet housing adviser in my own constituency and know for instance that housing allowance continue not to rise with cost have cause an enormous increase in the already rise number of case of homelessness this use not to be problem in my part of lancashire but we be see vast number of family be make homeless by section no fault eviction and rent rise at record rate the only thing can see come from this government on housing be allow landlord to do net zero turn to keep energy efficient home there for tenant but all the while we have see rise in the cost to local authority of address thing such as homelessness on transport network north be all promise but we have already be promise an awful lot in the north and it have fail to be deliver be this go to be yet another broken promise after so many broken transport promise we know that of the announcement so far have be reannouncement what about rural bus service my constituent in village such as forton scorton and winmarleigh desperately need access to public transport but they remain cut off there be nothing in the king speech about active travel walk or cycling as someone who be incredibly concerned about air quality in the village of galgate and on the one way system in lancaster city centre know that we need to encourage active travel but in way that be safe for public health as well have the pleasure of visit with the canal river trust stretch of the lancaster canal that be desperately in need of renovation and the government cut to the trust will have hugely detrimental impact not only in my constituency but across our canal network when one in seven people in england be await nhs treatment and childcare be unaffordable it seem to that government be go about thing bit back to front with their announcement on work and pension they be do nothing to tackle the root cause of people be out of work it be clear that the country need change but it be not be offer change by this tired and out of idea government only labour government will bring about the change that my constituent in lancaster and fleetwood need represent two university and recently conduct survey among student about the cost of living crisis student be acutely affect by the cost of living crisis and they be often unable to work the hour they need to work to meet the shortfall in their rent would like to see something from the government to address the student cost of living crisis also my rural constituent struggle to access reliable and fast broadband but there be nothing in the king speech to address their need an issue that be very close to my heart be redress for those who have be victim of sodium valproate which harm countless number of child who be now grow up adult with huge need and disability the woman affect be lie to by medical professional they continue with their pregnancy while be prescribe drug that harm their unborn baby it be important that we give redress to the victim of scandal that have span decade and generation sodium valproate continue to be prescribe today and for some woman it will be the only medication that will control their epilepsy but where it be not we must go far and fast to ensure that they can transition to other medication that do not have harmful effect on their unborn child urge those on the treasury bench to hear my call as chair of the all party parliamentary group for valproate and other anti epileptic drug in pregnancy and to ensure that redress be give to the family who need it it be imperative that we secure high sustain economic growth right across the uk some welcome policy be already be implement and there be some good initiative in the king speech although we face enormous challenge the focus of my comment will be on coastal community and on east anglia suggest that to deliver endure economic growth we need to address six issue first there be the cost of living crisis covid have long and vicious tail the cost of living crisis be still very much with we and this winter be likely to be very tough for many people the household support grant have be successful and must continue and other measure such as an increase in the local housing allowance must be give full consideration welfare reform must provide clear and support pathway for those who be some distance from the workplace secondly we must build more house particularly for social rent the vehicle of delivery be primarily the housing association many of which be currently face significant challenge and homes england the recent announcement of funding to redevelop the former sanyo site in lowestoft be particularly welcome thirdly in coastal britain in place such as lowestoft there be exciting new job emerge in the renewable sector last week announcement of funding for local skill improvement plan include for norfolk and suffolk be welcome but we need to ensure that trainer and college such as east coast college in lowestoft receive realistic revenue funding settlement progress have be make in recent year but further education still receive raw deal fourthly investment in infrastructure right across the uk be vital in lowestoft construction of the gull wing bridge be well advanced and there now need to be an emphasis on improve regional connectivity whether road rail or the digital highway around the uk to encourage investment and to protect home coastal community must be make secure from the more prevalent extreme weather condition we be now experience with an eye to the opportunity arise from offshore energy and sustainable fishing there must be fiscal incentive to encourage investment in port infrastructure fifthly net zero must be see as an opportunity to revitalise coastal community all around the uk can understand and support the rationale for the offshore petroleum licensing bill but it must be part of long term strategy up to and beyond to maximise private sector investment energy policy must be set in year not five year framework sixthly and finally we need to revitalise our town which for century have be hub of economic activity all around the uk town deal of which lowestoft be recipient be welcome as be the recently announce long term plan for town but those initiative can provide financial support for only limited number of centre and we need to put in place growth framework for all town that promote their revitalisation and ensure they remain honeypot for set up sme that framework could include make it easy to set up banking hub at present there be very high bar to set they up and continue the reform of business rate we make start in the non domestic rating act which receive royal assent last month but it be only timid move towards get the business rate multiplier back down to between and in the pound that be need to ensure that business can plan with some certainty rather than have to wait each year for the cliff edge of whether the chancellor will extend business rate relief we should also consider the zero rating of vat for redevelopment in and around our town centre town centre across the uk have an awful lot of heritage that properly realise and embrace could help to promote they and get they back to be magnet and catalyst for economic growth it be pleasure to follow the balanced and thoughtful speech by the hon member for waveney peter aldous secure high sustain economic growth in every part of the country be an ambition we should all have in this house the challenge lie in how we go about achieve that ambition the government plan just be not work at the start of the year the prime minister and chancellor promise to get the economy grow instead growth be flatline as the shadow chancellor mention the bank of england have downgrade its economic forecast and the international monetary fund forecast that the uk will have the low growth in the next year labour do have plan one that will grow the economy and get britain build again we need fast approval of critical infrastructure we need investment in the industry of the future we need to get more people own their own home and we must raise living standard in my constituency we have oven ready scheme that would help achieve our ambition scheme would unlock the delivery of more than home enable the development of world class health and care research facility and create thousand of job and opportunity across growth sector the government be aware of those scheme and should and could have support manchester and trafford to deliver they the two town centre in my constituency wythenshawe and sale submit bid to the last round of the levelling up fund in wythenshawe town centre manchester city council have invest million in plan to provide once in generation programme of regeneration include more than new home it should not be this difficult those home will breathe new life job and vital economic activity into the town centre in sale town centre in addition to the successful regeneration of stanley square by altered space trafford council have buy and be demolish sale magistrate court in order to build dozen of new and affordable home on the site it have regeneration plan for other location in the town centre include the leisure facility and the public realm however both bid to the levelling up fund for wythenshawe and for sale be reject by the government we have an approve masterplan for wythenshawe hospital in my constituency which will see the transformation of the increasingly out of date hospital campus into state of the art health village with affordable housing for nurse and an aparthotel it will also create world class research facility in the health and care sector sustainable campus that deliver commitment to be net zero by and other complementary us such as hotel conferencing training and retail all of that will be do while deliver inclusive growth which will derive maximum benefit through local job creation and employment and training opportunity ensure that it be local people who see the benefit in addition to those in the region the delivery model propose for the development of wythenshawe hospital be financially drive phase construction approach use blended funding that funding solution could leverage the many commercial health and social relate investment opportunity afford by the site prime location while support the requirement of reduced level of nhs capital however to realise this opportunity government and treasury support be need to unlock technical solution to the current nhs capital regime it be now more than month since the approval of the masterplan and we have see zero progress from this government on workable solution although be grateful to lord markham for engage with and with homes england on this issue this be not get britain building it be block britain build and flatline our economic growth my area also have the airport city masterplan manchester airport in my constituency be the large uk airport outside london and it provide international and domestic passenger and freight connectivity for the whole of northern britain welcome the government pledge in the king speech to begin to look at consumer protection and the consumer experience in our airline industry the current transformation plan at my local airport will support million passenger by there be still much to do surface transport the fabric of the estate and active travel all need to be address the plan be set to deliver up to million square foot and job with company such as the hut group amazon and dhl already work on site wythenshawe and sale east have plan to get britain building and to grow our economy we have world class airport an airport city enterprise zone the wythenshawe hospital masterplan and plan for the development of wythenshawe and sale town centre this be the prime minister first king speech yet he have nothing to say on housing and it include more division and more of the same what be need to deliver the economic growth our country need be change change be the question at the next election and the answer be labour labour government will offer decade of national renewal and replace the year of national decline that we have have welcome the emphasis in the king speech on improve the life chance of young people through the provision of academic and technical education which be key to secure high and sustain economic growth in every part of the country include beautiful hastings and rye ensure that young people have the knowledge and skill to succeed be especially important in hastings and rye coastal community that like many other be struggle with high level of educational and vocational deprivation result in local workforce whose skill do not adequately meet the local need especially in our wonderful engineering and manufacturing business such as focus sb technoturn general dynamics marshall tufflex and torr scientific to name but few academic education be not the only path for our young people and it be right to have equal focus and funding for technical and vocational skill skill be key to economic growth they be form of currency in the work world in today ever change job market employer be often more interested in hire employee with specific skillset rather than those who simply have university degree therefore the focus on apprenticeship be fantastic but in coastal community such as hastings these must centre on young people and sme we have an increase number of neet those not in education employment or training accord to the youth futures foundation if we match the low neet rate in the oecd which be in the netherlands we could see billion boost in gdp focus on revenue funding for youth service rather than on capital funding be need so that organisation such as xtrax and the centre in my constituency can do their thing coastal community have huge potential to become resource coastal powerhouse to the uk rather than problem to solve it be fantastic that hastings receive million in the town deal hastings and rother both have level up partnership and hastings will receive an additional million over the next year but our coastal community also need policy focus to unleash their potential and become valuable powerhouse for the uk our coastline and coastal community should be at the forefront of nature base solution to climate change and renewable energy industry include offshore wind development green hydrogen production and wave and tidal stream energy the government should be ramp up investment in those area leverage in private investment and boost coastal community skill must evolve with the need of the modern labour market and specific action be need to generate new skill to encourage more diversity of employment and to meet the need of local employment opportunity we have in hastings and rye besides wonderful career opportunity in tourism and hospitality an incredible engineering and manufacturing sector that want to grow but that need skilled workforce through the town fund east sussex coast college have develop an important regional scale project at its ore campus that will improve skill provision in the new green and low carbon technology as regard recent announcement about education the new advanced british standard will take the good of level and level and replace they bring together the technical and academic route into single qualification which will widen the breadth of british school education the propose qualification will require sea change in education thinking and will rely on the treasury fund new qualification for thousand of young people the standard success will rely on ministers encourage the delivery of technical subject at level and the government have cite the education model of many european country as proof that we need the standard however key feature of those country model be technical education from the age of or which have become rarity in the uk that be why be an advocate of the baker dearing educational trust university technical college sleeve decision by minister on the proposal for utc sleeve within exist secondary school be anticipate soon baker dearing be aware of significant number of large highly regarded multi academy trust that wish to introduce the utc sleeve model into at least one of their secondary school because they can see the benefit of that approach in improve student engagement attendance and outcome among certain pupil cohort and have witness the increase interest in high quality apprenticeship for leaver age all of that will contribute to economic growth affordable housing be also key to economic growth for many reason not least that child and young people can access education and employment opportunity only if they have safe and secure home finally improve transport connection and road and provide fast rail and bus service be essential for hastings and rye and east sussex as whole to encourage and facilitate economic growth poor transport connectivity continue to blight hastings and rye and it would help if transport for the south east be make statutory body rise want to get everybody in as fairly as possible so the time limit will be reduce to five minute after the next speaker it be pleasure to speak in this debate on his majesty first king speech the news last week that the uk economy flatline in the third quarter of this year be hardly shock it be the result of year of conservative choice that have deliver low growth skyrocket mortgage soar price crumble public service and house building at its low rate since the second world war every family and business in britain have pay the price of the conservatives fail energy policy leave britain the bad hit country in western europe listen to the king speech last week be disappoint by the absence of serious agenda on planning infrastructure and growth with no housing target or planning reform weaken proposal for leasehold and renter reform and the binning of the government manifesto promise to deliver home year meanwhile my constituent be leave spend nearly two fifth of their income on rent even before tax live in housing that be cold damp mouldy and expensive to heat and with tory mortgage penalty that be estimate to take out of the pocket of family in birmingham edgbaston this year to his credit the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities admit that the uk housing system be break but it be hard to see what this king speech do to change that that bring to my first point about the length of time it take for anything to get build under this government be great example the previous labour government complete on time and under budget this government have year and they fail which mean that the big infrastructure project in europe be cancel my constituent understand that modern public transport be not just about journey time to london but about free up capacity and connectivity to all the other major city and town so that people can travel for work leisure education and training it can widen the horizon of their ambition and bring the whole of the region close together what be they leave with now they be leave with gap great building site in the centre of birmingham for year to come all the disruption and delay of the work at curzon street for high speed rail to nowhere more delay to the east birmingham metro which under mayor andy street will cost taxpayer per metre of track and to top it all no alternative to avanti on the west coast main line have achieve the dubious distinction of have the most complaint of any operator and consistently ranking as one of the bad perform on the entire rail network this government decide to hand avanti lucrative new contract what do avanti do it announce swathe of cut to service on the west coast main line before the ink have dry at the root of so many of the problem beset british infrastructure and our housing crisis be the planning system surely no one in the house would agree that the current regime be fit for purpose when we have million lock out of the dream of home ownership bill soar and huge national infrastructure challenge such as the race for net zero we can not go on like this there be currently billion of clean energy project stick in the queue for connection to the national grid this country once build the national grid in less time than it now take to get connection to it labour have set out plan for great british energy which will procure the grid supply chain that britain need and bring down bill the government flagship king speech energy policy will not take single penny off energy bill and even the energy secretary have admit that the uk have some of the least energy efficient home in europe and birmingham have some of the bad rate of mould and damp in the country as we face another cold winter with energy bill as high as they have be in live memory my constituent be seriously worried about the toll on their finance and their health what be in the king speech for they primary school teacher contact about pupil in year just seven year old who tell she that she could not sleep at night because the mould exacerbate her asthma and she could barely breathe my constituent agnes junior doctor live in privately rent accommodation riddle with mould and damp tell she feel helpless as she could not end her contract and her landlord would not help birmingham have nearly rental home with category hazard such as excessive cold mould and damp the council be now get on with take rogue landlord to task and have launch the cities retrofit scheme with coventry and wolverhampton to help to shape the local retrofit market use their combine social home but where be the government support they where be the government version of labour warm home plan to upgrade million home cut energy bill and create thousand of good job for electrician engineer and construction worker across our country my constituent can not afford government that will not grasp the difficult issue or take the long term decision the country need whether on house building national infrastructure or the cost of living this king speech do nothing to measure up to the scale of the challenge that the economy or my constituent face labour meanwhile will build million home over five year with planning reform blitz planning passport for urban brownfield development and devolution package to spread power out of westminster and into community on housing transport energy and more that be the ambition we need national mission to get britain build again and grow our country from the grassroot plan to expand the country productive capability and at the same time to change who benefit do it not say it all that after year of the last labour government disposable income have rise by more than be per person back in people pocket yet disposable income be now forecast to grow by just between and last week we should have have king speech that put work people first and plan to get britain build again secure high sustain economic growth in every part of the country only labour will get britain future back it be pleasure to speak in the first king speech debate in nearly year look back at my comment during the last humble address debate where the government promise to make hundred of million of pound worth of upgrade to my local hospital and construct new specialist emergency care hospital be grateful that the first set of fund have now be release for that the king speech contain lot to be welcome include the media bill the draft rail reform bill the renters reform bill the sentencing bill and the victims and prisoners bill turn however to the theme of today debate secure high sustain economic growth in every part of the country commend the government for focus on economic growth only with economic growth can we pay for those public service that our constituent rely on and want to touch on few of those today will start with rail although carshalton and wallington be in london borough it be one of the worst connect part of greater london and would hugely benefit from more efficient rail network to enable people to travel not just in and out of central london but across london as well fact consistently lose on the mayor of london as we consistently come last out of all london borough for investment from this mayor invite the government to look again at the redistribution of funding from to see whether any of that funding can be allocate to the croydon area remodelle scheme to unlock the brighton mainline and deliver improvement on that important link move on want to talk about be safe online many of my constituent raise with issue include scam on social medium platform such as meta look forward to see how the digital markets competition and consumers bill will be able to bring back consumer confidence online and provide robust legal framework so that people can trust the service provide to they want to touch on other element of the king speech welcome the government ambition to make people safety and security paramount for the next parliamentary session that be particularly salient in carshalton and wallington where the mayor of london continue to fail to grasp the problem of violent crime in the capital he promise violence reduction unit but we be yet to see any detail of that unit operation or what effect it have have we have recently see number of attack locally include an horrendous knife attack on the roundshaw estate many of my constituent be wait with bated breath to see how the criminal justice bill will tackle the scourge that be knife crime and violent crime tougher sentencing be an important step forward but remind those on the treasury front bench of my interest in restorative justice and the part that that could play in break the cycle of reoffende look forward to the conclusion of the victims and prisoners bill and hope that right to access restorative justice service will be include in it so that we can help people to break the cycle of reoffende of course punishment must be part of that as well and create criminal offence for the possession of bladed article with intent to cause harm will help to take more knife off our street and stop the next generation take up knife in the first place lastly let touch briefly on the renters reform bill which will affect many of my constituent and many londoners hear from many renter that there be no way of hold their landlord to account and that housing quality be not keep up to standard the privately rent property portal will hope be able to provide some security for tenant landlords will also benefit from the bill as they will be able to evict antisocial tenant more easily and dispute will be quick and easy to resolve hope that as the bill make progress through the house we bring more harmony between landlord and tenant and make the uk much safe place in which to live and rent crack down on wrongdoer while support innovator overall very much welcome the measure in the king speech absolutely welcome the government focus on and commitment to economic growth because to repeat what say at the beginning of my remark without economic growth through back wealth creator and entrepreneur we will not see the improvement in public service that we desperately want will address the crisis in the middle east and the government failure to back the grow call for ceasefire from the un secretary general and beyond and will speak to amendment table by my hon friend the member for coventry south zarah sultana of which be sponsor already after just five week more than people in gaza and more than israelis have be kill it be the duty of everyone in this house to help save life both palestinian and israeli to help stop the bombing to help end the suffering to help free the hostage to stop the war crime and to get the aid that be so desperately need into gaza that mean that we have to work for ceasefire and that work need to happen now there be not second to waste the un secretary general say that the way forward be ceasefire and so do the un high commissioner for human rights in fact the head of all major un agency be call for humanitarian ceasefire so why do our government think that they know well than the world lead humanitarian agency president macron have now call for ceasefire so france join other european nation such as spain norway portugal switzerland and ireland as well as the un secretary general in that call other major nation such as brazil and middle eastern nation include qatar saudi arabia the united arab emirates and egypt be all call for ceasefire secure negotiate ceasefire one bind on all side be achievable but it require huge diplomatic effort it be time for our government to add their weight to the push for ceasefire rather than dismiss out of hand proposal that have grow international support especially when poll show that two third of the british public want ceasefire be afraid that the government have instead seek to distort what be be demand so let we be totally clear ceasefire mean that all side stop fire that require negotiation so our government should be strain every sinew use every possible diplomatic avenue and talk to government of all persuasion those with sway in israel and those with channel to hamas such as qatar to secure negotiate ceasefire that be bind on all party and bring an end to this crisis of course secure ceasefire will not be easy but it will not happen if government do not even bother to try once we secure that ceasefire instead of more bloodshed more suffering and occupation let we turn this moment as difficult as it now seem into the moment when we secure alongside israel the viable palestinian state that be so need for the cause of justice refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests it be an honour to speak in the first king speech debate in over year and pay tribute to his majesty the king for the grace and dignity with which he have take up his duty and deliver his first gracious speech there be much to welcome in this gracious speech which set out long term measure to safeguard our country future whether it be keep community safe through tough sentencing of prisoner secure our energy security while maintain our net zero commitment or secure economic growth across every part of our country know that my constituent in burton and uttoxeter be really feel the effect of recent high inflation and the impact it have have on household finance early this year the office for budget responsibility report that the economic and fiscal outlook have brighten somewhat but there be still challenge we must encourage productivity growth and business investment but we need the infrastructure in place to support that growth be very proud to be the project champion for the corridor which run through my constituency and be key strategic link for many international business include jcb toyota rolls royce nestlé and many more unfortunately this key piece of our nation manufacturing infrastructure be currently cost our economy million each year due to delay impact resident commuter and business at several pinch point the corridor be slow and unreliable with average rush hour speed of mph vital improvement need to be make to unlock the potential of this corridor and the proposal put together by midlands connect offer long term programme of intervention to improve reliability and shorten journey time this be about not only improve connectivity for resident and business but create job drive innovation and reduce emission through alternative fuel and electric vehicle infrastructure these improvement would support new home and new job by as well as improve air quality make bad by chronic congestion be delighted when the prime minister announce that as part of network north this vital corridor will finally see the investment it need which will mean improvement in journey time and as midlands connect find in its recent report the potential to generate billion for the economy further investment in our region will allow the world class business base here to expand develop and unleash the potential of new green technology new hydrogen engine be be develop which will be use in passenger transport and heavy plant machinery of the future pay tribute to the work be undertake by staffordshire county council to promote the region as the uk hydrogen valley and look forward to work with ministers through this parliament to deliver these improvement at pace and realise the benefit of economic growth for my constituent and those who live and work in the area refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests thin empty just depress lose the will to lead and nothing in this for the public those be the report word of tory mps describe the measure or lack of measure in the king speech other be pleased as the thin legislative programme give the optimist more time to campaign in their constituency ahead of general election and the realist more time to look for new job the pm claim he be take difficult decision but it be the people in this country who be make the difficult decision every single day as they make sacrifice and grapple with cost of living crisis make in downing street figure release yesterday show that not only have poverty rise in the uk but that in nearly million people experience destitution and thousand of baby and toddler be be admit to hospital with lung condition believe to be from live in damp and mouldy home despite this there be absolutely nothing in the king speech to help those family not that long ago the united nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human right visit the uk and find that conservative governments have inflict great misery through punitive mean spirited and often callous austerity policy drive by political desire to undertake social re engineering rather than by economic necessity this month his successor reiterate those concern state that uk policy continue to inflict misery even in pandemic the government could not prioritise child first we have the chaotic voucher scheme then tory mp vote to withdraw support for free school meal the holiday activity and food programme be hard fight for from onwards but it be not until that the government decide to roll it out my fully cost school breakfast bill would have see nearly million child start the day with full stomach instead the government introduce scheme that provide support to only out of the school they identify as eligible my cost neutral healthy start scheme take up no bill would ensure that eligible family automatically receive free fruit vegetable and milk instead the government claim that financial regulation be prevent auto enrolment despite the payment and card operator say that it would be entirely possible if only the government would co operate evidence give to the child of the north all party parliamentary group show that child in the north be more likely to live in poverty we hear testimony from expectant mother who have be force to have abortion because they can not afford another mouth to feed and clothe it be estimate that million child now live in poverty in my part of the world the north east we have the high rate of child poverty in the united kingdom at and in south shields that figure rise to over it be clear that level up just like the northern powerhouse before it be vacuous empty phrase that be never intend to and never will do anything to improve the life chance of the child in my area if the economy do not work for everyone and consign million of child to poverty the government have fail it be time for general election so that my party can do as we do last time and ensure that every single child have the very good start in life it be pleasure to speak in this debate on the first king speech for more than year particularly today on the occasion of his majesty birthday and particularly when the topic be economic growth which go to the heart of everything we be here to do in this place economic growth be not about statistic percentage and headline in the financial times it be about the real impact on household resident and business across our constituency and the whole country would say this but in my constituency of burnley and padiham we probably have the good set of local business anywhere in the country they do not just stand ready to help we with our future economic growth they be do it already be think of brilliant business in burnley include multinational like veka and safran nacelles and big bakery like warburtons and cherrytree in padiham we have business like lp technology which be expand at rapid pace and so many more that be what we do in burnley and padiham we make thing and we export they that be the first thing about the king speech that want to touch on since the general election we have pass some exciting legislation and sign some exciting trade deal with country include australia and new zealand be privileged to sit on the bill committee during the passage of the trade act in which we roll over whole swathe of trade deal from our membership of the eu it be very exciting that we be now look at those same trade deal and see where we can go far strengthen our relationship with fast grow country that be exactly what the new legislation for cptpp will do growth in country like vietnam and canada be fast than almost anywhere else in the world those be the country where our business can seize opportunity lp technology one of the business in padiham that just mention be go to country like australia and sign massive business deal that be only possible because of the amazing work of our trade negotiator and the team in the department for business and trade the more of that we can do the well economic growth be centre in our community and that be why be delighted to see the long term plan for town mention in the king speech since we have do an incredible job in burnley and padiham of work with government to secure levelling up funding we secure million from levelling up fund and million from levelling up fund and the prime minister come to burnley personally to announce that we be one of the town to get furth million as part of the long term plan we be go to use that to work with community to find the thing we need to do to secure extra economic growth in the second town in my constituency padiham we have flood defence scheme worth almost million that be secure the future of the town the local economy and the resident who live there none of that would be possible without employment and be delighted to hear my right hon friend the chancellor speak at the opening of this debate about his plan in the autumn statement next week to make progress on help people get into work unfortunately in burnley we continue to have an unemployment rate that be high than the national average and that apply to both adult and young people we be make massive progress in tackle that issue and it be important we tackle it because of the real impact it have on people and family the good thing we can do to help family in burnley be to help they get into work and that be particularly true of household that have be out of work for some time hope that in the autumn statement next week we hear more from the chancellor on the work he have be do with the secretary of state for work and pensions on tackle long term out of work household will end by talk about the final thing that think make massive difference to economic growth even if it be politician hobby horse and that be pothole our road in burnley and indeed across lancashire need upgrading we have brilliant logistic business in burnley that take the product have mention and send they around the world but we can only do that with road and infrastructure that be fit for the century my final ask of those on the treasury bench be that as we look to the autumn statement and the budget we continue the focus on pothole and on the infrastructure that make our country work it be pleasure to follow the hon member for burnley antony higginbotham even by the standard of this shambolic government this king speech be wafer thin effort that might be forgivable if we be live in country where public service be in good shape and the economy be go gangbuster but we be not the reality be that after year of tory neglect britain be break and nothing work any more there be an nhs waiting list of million school be literally crumble and train be unreliable extortionately expensive and pack to the rafter some of crime be go unsolved with dreadful conviction rate and victim face three year court delay while raw sewage be be pump into our river and child poverty have triple since this be an utterly shameful record but it be not only our public service that the conservatives have break they have also take wreck ball to our economy with kamikaze budget that cost billion and it be work people who be pay the price with mortgage up almost rent up and the weekly food shop up on last year their approach to the economy be plain to see low public investment have lead to the uk have the low private investment in the developed world sclerotic planning system and rampant nimbyism have hinder house building and stymie our wind farm development and the abandonment of our manufacturing sector have lead to the uk be the most regionally imbalance economy in the developed world if we be to clear up this conservative mess we be go to need decade of national renewal deliver by mission drive labour government so labour first two mission be to deliver the high sustained growth in the and to make britain clean energy superpower the crucial point here be that these two mission go hand in hand they will be the mutually reinforcing driver of the green job revolution that labour will deliver just look at the opportunity in float offshore wind in my aberavon constituency flow be prime example of where wales geography offer huge competitive advantage with the potential to create job deliver energy security and low household bill but we need central government to match these ambition deliver on the full potential of gw of clean energy by offer fair strike price for developer in return for ensure that the manufacture supply chain job be keep here in the uk if we get this right port talbot could become green energy and manufacturing hub with our steelwork make the steel for the float turbine substructure in new plate mill and those very turbine then provide the energy to run the port talbot steelwork as well as power ten of million of home across the uk this bold ambitious pioneer plan can become model for new economy south wales be the cradle of the first industrial revolution and labour government in westminster work in close partnership with the welsh labour government in cardiff bay will put our proud country at the heart of the green industrial revolution whichever way we look at it we need to make buy and sell more in britain labour know that this begin with the steel industry with our billion clean steel renewal commitment dwarf the government dangerously unambitious and short sighted approach the conservatives be fail to understand the grow commercial opportunity that strong british steel industry would be well position to seize and they be fail to recognise the risk of over reliance on other country decarbonisation be of course important not least because consumer be increasingly demand greener product but decarbonisation must not become byword for deindustrialisation it would be utterly unforgiveable if the deal that the government have do with tata steel lead to the offshoring of production good job and carbon emission to other country that use dirty steelmaking process and that do not always have britain good interest at heart this king speech be noteworthy more for what it do not contain than for what it do there be nothing on the cost of living crisis nothing on the crisis in our public service nothing to address our protract productivity crisis and nothing to tackle the epidemic of business bankruptcy that we see this summer that be because this be government who have give up on govern they just sit there desperately cling on to power for power sake and argue with one another the british people want government who see problem as something to be solve not something to be exploit the choice be clear five more year of the same tory chaos or labour government who will give britain its future back transport infrastructure and regional connectivity be key to increase both regional and national economic growth they be the key to truly level up yet as be the case with actual measure to tackle the cost of living neither the chancellor nor indeed the shadow chancellor say anything whatsoever about they in their speech early today the williams rail review be commission three transport secretaries ago in although do wonder yesterday if might have to change that to four transport secretaries ago it recommend the formation of great british railways and ever since then secretaries of state and rail ministers have stand at the dispatch box and promise the legislation necessary to deliver gbr which the right hon member for welwyn hatfield grant shapps promise would be rail revolution well it be very sedately pace revolution if george washington and co have proceed with their revolution at the same speed there be fair chance that they would still be use pound shilling and penny and happily drink tea in boston harbour it be ridiculously slow when ask in june the government have already spend more than million on the great british railways transition team but what transition if there be only the promise of draft bill in this session that kick any action down the track until after polling day we be tell that gbr be vital to the future of the rail network if it be so vital we in this place should be debate and vote on it before polling day at least the government manage to find room in their legislative timetable to deal with the menace of pedicab in london topic on which be sure member outwith the have be absolutely inundate with correspondence the home county and area inside the have as ever be do well from uk government spending stage of east west rail be project to cost billion crossrail billion thameslink billion and the remnant of nearly billion the treasury own figure show that the east midland sit at under third of per capita transport spending compare with london with the south west at and the north east at that be not level up or secure high sustain economic growth in every part of the country it be leave the region of england with scrap from the table while london get gold plat investment each and every time meanwhile scotland have government who actually do thing such as rolling electrification reopen line trialle peak fare abolition and the full public ownership of rail service under scottish government control clearly there be lot more to do but instead of push value for the taxpayer by gouge passenger and cut spending scotrail and the scottish government be target gain in revenue by boost usage with the result that passenger number be up by on last year across the network the high by country mile of any uk rail operator that show what ambition can mean and can deliver it be high time that the uk government show the same level of ambition so that the rest of england be not leave even far behind we have also see the uk government publish their minimum service level regulation it be disgrace that we have government who use victorian milliner as the template for industrial relation in the century with list of the rail service that worker will be compel to operate under penalty of prosecution publish on the website it be surely no coincidence that european country with progressive employment law where employee be treat with respect and be social partner have some of the well perform economy with the high standard of living there be simply no way to secure high sustained economic growth in every part of the country when government policy be to treat skilled worker as chattel to be absolutely clear the scottish government will play no part in this forced labour scheme and we will not co operate with the uk government on the implementation of this appalling measure in our transport network or in any other area of devolve policy people in scotland have have no faith in the conservative party to deliver well economy for decade its last election win in our country be in and since the it have remain rump in scottish politic it be the only main party not to have hold office in holyrood fact unlikely to change any time soon conservative defence of the union as an engine of economic development have be threadbare for year but ever more so as the few remain strand keep the uk aloft be be pick apart by their own action brexit and the cost of living crisis continue to wreak havoc on community across scotland and the rest of these isle job and industry be downscale and close all the time with both main uk party commit to the insular and dogmatic rule britannia policy so beloved of the daily mail there be an opportunity for scotland to build well future it be time that both uk party stop block that opportunity and respect the right of the scottish people to grasp that future and choose independence be grateful for the opportunity to speak in this king speech debate after year in power five prime ministers seven chancellor an economic crash and brexit without plan last week we be present with wafer thin programme that honestly could be do by christmas many of the bills carry over be water down and weaken version of their original self one example be the renters reform bill we have to wait four year to debate the bill there be five month between first and second reading yet the bill go nowhere near far enough to protect renter properly particularly from no fault eviction court proceeding for no fault eviction be at seven year high my borough of enfield have be hit particularly hard by this eviction crisis have the high number of section eviction in the whole of london it lead to massive increase in homelessness increase use of temporary accommodation such as hotel huge financial burden on local authority as they try to grapple with the cost of that accommodation and increase fear and anxiety for family across the country fear that the government know all too well the impact that these eviction be have on people but they either do not care or can not stand up to their party last week we have the former home secretary the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman declare war on the use of tent on the street disgracefully state that homelessness be lifestyle choice accord to the charity crisis the loss of private tenancy be the lead cause of homelessness in enfield the risk of homelessness increase by because of section notice last year this government have choose to delay ban section eviction for four year these be not lifestyle choice they be hard evidence of tory failure these eviction be not only deeply distress to renter cause grief and hardship but costly to the public purse in fact enfield council face spend an additional million on temporary accommodation this year alone that is million that the local authority can no long spend on public service despite the dire need for investment and reform that is fund it can no long spend on housing or on stuff like social care the list go on rent in the uk be recently report to be the high on record far too few home be be build mortgage rate be spiral out of control and family in my constituency of enfield north be pay an extra on their mortgage every month all thank to year of economic mismanagement and the tory party mortgage bombshell thing like work hard buy home and raise family be difficult enough as it be people expect the government to keep the economy stable so that their family future be secure but meet monthly payment be now force tough choice from have to cut back on the weekly shop to abandon family holiday food bank in my constituency recently tell that demand this year be out of control all those problem demand the very good from the government but sadly they have no plan to fix they our economy like our country be cry out for change we need government who be on the side of work people and who have ambition energy and idea but this be tired government who have lose their goal to govern the prime minister and his government have fail my constituent and the country the only way to deliver the change he talk about and which the country need be to call general election the word in the title of the debate economic growth in every part of the country feel like some kind of cruel gaslighting give the dire economic condition that too many of our constituent face after year of this government we have have devastating austerity public service slash local government decimate the growth of privatised monopoly and the creep privatisation of everything from healthcare to our very own datum give that track record do not think that anybody expect the short monarch speech since to contain the seed of britain salvation it be increasingly clear that only change of government will achieve that goal therefore in many way my contribution be not just for the current government but for any government who may come to power in the near future genuine levelling up which many of we in this place believe in imply that everyone and everywhere that contribute to the uk prosperity should share in the bounty they help create it be simple principle if we accept it by that metric former british caribbean island should be at the front of the queue when it come to level up this be know internationally as reparatory justice namely recognition of and compensation for transatlantic chattel slavery which be the great atrocity in the history of humankind without parallel in its brutality in its year length and in its profitability at its century height slave plantation be make billion to billion year in profit at price make caribbean economy the single big source of imperial gain ever see the recent brattle report commission by the university of the west indies estimate that the uk owe trillion in compensation to caribbean island for the hundred of year of exploitation that be not just for chattel slavery but for the continue brutal and bloody exploitation that take place after emancipation for that emancipation the slave owner not the slave be pay billion of pound of compensation and we as country everyone in the chamber only finish pay off the debt for that in when recently go back to the caribbean have the chance to speak to everyone from dickon mitchell the prime minister of grenada through to avinash persaud key economic adviser to mia mottley the prime minister of barbados must admit that be bit of stuck record ask why my constituent should be expect to pay reparation to the caribbean when many of they will struggle to heat their home and feed themselves this winter the answer be intriguing be tell that they should not arley gill chair of the grenada national reparations commission be very clear he tell that the family corporation bank and other institution that have exploit the caribbean for century and continue to do so be the same one that hoard that wealth in the uk or the various british overseas territory for tax avoidance purpose unless we in this country be prepared to tax wealth more deal with the imperial legacy of britain network of global tax haven and challenge corporate power whose extractive and exploitive practice have now boomerang back from empire to almost every aspect of our life here in the uk we will never be able to fix our broken economy by boomerang mean housing water energy and transport be privatised and health on its way nearly every aspect of our life these past year have become financialise leave million of our constituent in poverty and debt thus the structural adjustment of the caribbean become austerity and privatisation for the uk if we in this place be to live up to our stated rhetoric of equality fairness and justice we need to understand that our responsibility stretch to all who have contribute to this country wealth wherever they may be as such let we start that process with simple statement of acknowledgment on this country prosperity britain do not develop the world the world develop britain want to concentrate on the northern ireland economy as this be primarily debate on the economy first however want to touch upon the situation in the middle east and in particular the need for ceasefire utterly condemn the action of hamas as terrorism however we must recognise that israel response have be disproportionate represent collective punishment and see ongoing breach of international humanitarian law we have all be deeply touch by the image we have see on our television and we know that there be massive humanitarian crisis ongoing in gaza hopefully we all recognise that there be no military solution to the situation the only way forward lie in both israel and palestine have freedom and security and the reaching of political accommodation notably with two state solution continue death and destruction achieve nothing arguably it make the situation even hard because it will only compound people sense of bitterness and feed extremism it also risk wide regional escalation ceasefire which must include the release of hostage and humanitarian access require collective international effort as do the renew peace process that should follow any initial ceasefire hope can speak with some degree of authority on peace process give my experience in northern ireland move on to the situation in northern ireland our economy continue to function and business be continue to invest but our economy be be hold back massively by the absence of devolve executive we need an executive for political stability and investment in skill infrastructure and research and development as former minister for employment and learning in northern ireland appreciate the importance of skill rather than further investment in those area in northern ireland we be see budget cut the impact on further and high education be mirror more widely in health education and other public service want to see restore executive work closely with the uk government to address northern ireland current financial crisis through two key intervention the first be the introduction of what be call fiscal floor northern ireland be structurally underfunde by around million year fiscal floor would need to be set at the correct level take into account policing and justice need base on the most relevant period to adjust for inflation as that be base on actual need as assess by the government at that particular point we have the precedent of what happen in wales feed by the holtham commission that model could be replicate with adjustment for northern ireland relatively quickly we also need transformation fund we can not fix public service in northern ireland from burn platform of cut and further cut we need an invest to save programme for both public service and our economy as part of renew financial package of course we have to learn lesson from previous financial package in northern ireland say to the government that fully accept that there will be need for certain degree of conditionality around any intervention but unless we have that financial package we be never go to turn the situation around in northern ireland we have very particular opportunity in northern ireland through the presence of the windsor framework welcome the government effort to secure it early this year be disappointed that other be fail to see the importance of that breakthrough and to return to the executive as consequence without function executive and those key intervention in our economy we will not be able to take full advantage of the opportunity provide by the framework particularly in term of dual market access finally will touch briefly on climate change it be by far the deep most far reach challenge face the world include we in the uk while the government target may remain there be clear sense that the brake be be slam it be false narrative to pitch economic wellbeing against climate change through green new deal we can address not just economic change but social justice alongside climate change strongly suggest that the narrative need to change around green new deal both uk wide and in northern ireland one of the great risk we face today as country and as global community be the climate and ecological emergency it be also one of the great risk to economic growth we need to align uk law with what science tell we be require for liveable future by pass the cross party back climate and ecology bill that be why table amendment which would deliver science lead join up strategy to build greener fair future for all and prioritise the protection of nature the housing sector be on track to use almost of the climate change committee recommend carbon budget that trajectory be unsustainable if we be to uphold our commitment under the paris agreement and play our part in limit global warming to we need home fit for the future the government have now prioritise step up the pace of retrofitting drive progress towards decarbonisation while provide much need assistance to our constituent during the cost of living crisis on planning we be tell that england will soon have new biodiversity net gain policy which will mandate that any new development must leave biodiversity in well state than before it be construct the oxford nature positive hub have expose serious challenge that threaten the integrity of the policy outcome include the oversight monitoring and enforcement of biodiversity improvement under the policy developer have three way to offset their biodiversity liability the damage their project do to nature but the process will be oversee by local planning department which be often lack in capacity and expertise we must prioritise the protection of nature the leader pledge for nature be welcome international commitment to not only halt nature loss by but set it firmly in reverse that be also the ambition set at last december which attend and which the government sign up to it be the apex nature target of the climate and ecology bill that be proud to draw attention to via amendment want to discuss gaza which the king refer to in his gracious speech like many other be at remembrance sunday event at local church be privileged to read micah which state he will judge between many people and will settle dispute for strong nation far and wide they will beat their sword into ploughshare and their spear into prune hook nation will not take up sword against nation nor will they train for war any more everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree matt broughton of st giles then give the eulogy he draw attention to the fact that the same land that be be fight over now be be fight over year ago micah be under threat of attack and assault but he could see the need for peace and peaceful settlement and the need to turn those sword into ploughshare he also draw attention to the fact that the only settlement would be through negotiation as we ourselves see in northern ireland and as the spanish see in the basque country although as matt broughton say now be time of uncertainty disharmony and fear we need to look to the future and think about how we can recreate two state for two people it be incumbent on we as the uk parliament and on the uk government to join the international effort that be be make pedro sánchez the spanish prime minister have propose that there should be peace conference after the conclusion of the conflict it be important that we create an intergenerational peace for the people of israel and the people of palestine this be not goal that should be see as too lofty or too difficult it be the only way in which we will move beyond the current conflict and beyond the discussion we be have about the cessation of hostility or ceasefire it be the only way in which we will bring peace to both people some say that there be not the partner for peace on both side but if we be to reach this goal the international community must make it their top priority to find those individual who exist in both israel and palestine and promote and support they in this debate we be discuss economic growth and it be fitting that my constituency be be represent because it have consistently deliver some of the high economic growth in the uk largely through be the premier distribution and logistic hub for our country however even in north west leicestershire be see the prosperity for which we have work so hard be undermine by an evident lack of leadership and accountability on the government part we need honest immediate change the government responsibility be to protect and serve its citizen not to pander to the world economic forum the world health organisation or other supranational body we appear to be slide towards marxism and the disruption of our traditional norm and value our history our religion and our institution what we desperately need be leadership that champion truth freedom and economic prosperity we be grapple with skyrocket inflation especially in food price with loom financial crisis out of control monthly mortgage payment and energy price that will reach new high this winter and increase fuel poverty across the country we end up here because of fiscal profligacy with zero accountability in addition to decade of reckless money print by the bank of england let we look at few of the most outrageous project loss that we have see have mean ten of billion lose while useless personal protective equipment and track and trace have lose we billion and billion respectively there be the financing of the war in ukraine which could have be bring to peace last march while our own people struggle to make end meet there be the economic crash and the stunting of economic growth because of with mile of north west leicestershire blight for decade there be the decade of delay to the regeneration of measham my most deprived village be pleased that the government have decide to reopen the ivanhoe line between burton on trent and leicester but concurrent plan to terminate it at coalville be insufficient it need to go all the way to leicester so that it can benefit the south derbyshire north west leicestershire and bosworth constituency asylum seeker in hotel be cost we more than million day do not think it fair that give that there be seven constituency in leicestershire of the asylum seeker have be locate in hotel in north west leicestershire taxis be high than they have be at any time in my life taxis be use to modify behaviour which be why we penally tax tobacco and alcohol but we be penally tax work when we want economic growth believe the chancellor say you can not borrow your way to economic growth but do that many time when be in business borrow money invest it in the business grow the business and pay the money back it would appear that the chancellor think we can tax our way to prosperity but do not think we will be able to do that either we be spend million on covid inquiry that be not ask the right question we need an admission from the government and the opposition that the flawed pandemic response be the cause of many of the problem we be suffer from now at time when our country be in crisis and family be struggle to make end meet why do this government persist in press forward with their nonsensical net zero agenda appreciate that the prime minister have announce delay maybe some would argue that it be retraction for some of the target but it be not enough he need to go far the fact be that the uk account for less than of global emission and on that basis we be voluntarily reject entire industry while at the same time communist china be allow to increase its emission by more than our total emission in every year of this decade if we press on with net zero it will cost trillion or possibly trillion slam money on to the national debt in way that our heir and successor will not thank we for the debt be now completely out of control and the global economy be on knife edge many be foresee major crash or another run on the bank and this could pave the way for programmable digital central bank currency hope not will oppose that and social credit scoring system our national debt be now trillion why would we trust the central banker again when they have get we into trouble twice in two decade we must immediately instate the effective fiscal process use in august whereby the financial collapse be check by introduce treasury bond know as the bradbury pound this be accept and it stabilise the market at the time it be not debt and it be not interest bearing it be treasury money we do not need to trust the central banker we need to use treasury money to solve the crisis exactly as we do in will speak to amendment table in the name of my hon friend the member for coventry south zarah sultana to which be signatory it be great shame that the king speech pay little heed to the immediate need for ceasefire in gaza it be over month since the dreadful attack on israeli civilian on october prompt massive wave of retaliatory violence in gaza over innocent palestinians have be kill and over injure the majority of those kill and injure have be woman and child who have long be suffer the inhumane living condition in gaza the large open air prison in the world hamas attack be contemptible and rightly condemn but the evil commit on october do not justify the disproportionate and unlawful response by israel the indiscriminate bombing of hospital bakery and even refugee camp have maximise the suffering of the palestinian people and drive they out of their home the withholding of water food fuel and medicine by israel constitute collective punishment which be prohibit under international law israel have fail to respond proportionately or lawfully and it have now kill more civilian than have be kill in all world conflict over the last three year it be no surprise that united nations expert have express grave concern that the people in gaza be face imminent genocide those expert have also make it clear that israel ally bear responsibility for the tragic situation unfold in gaza and that without immediate and decisive action the palestinian people face either death or complete displacement from their home give the terrible suffering of the people of gaza most of the british public now support ceasefire position that be not reflect by this government ceasefire be crucial to stop the violence and allow vital humanitarian assistance to find its way into gaza it be also essential to restart peace process that would see secure israel coexist with legitimate palestinian state however on this issue the international community and the uk in particular have fail illegal settler support by the israeli government have for year seize land and property from palestinians in the west bank undermine the territorial integrity and sovereignty of any potential palestinian state israeli force have continually attack worshipper at the al aqsa mosque in east jerusalem palestinian family and business have be force out of east jerusalem and the blockade of gaza have continue unabated for many year there be clearly element within israeli politic who have no wish or desire to see palestinians co exist alongside israel and who have use various mean to prevent this from happen in this context the much need leadership of country such as our in the peace process have be absent there be still no indication of when the uk will formally recognise the state of palestine despite year of promise early today we hear statement about two state solution for two state solution there have to be two equal state both of which have to be recognise of the member country of the united nations we be one of that do not recognise palestine how can we talk about two state solution when we do not even recognise they as equal the palestinian people have be abandon and now in their time of great need this government can not bring themselves to call for an immediate ceasefire that be why along with my colleague in this house will continue to demand ceasefire in gaza when half million people take to the street to demand ceasefire have be label by some member as hate march we realise that humanity have fail it be pleasure to speak in today debate particularly as this be my first king speech since have the honour of be elect as member of parliament by my constituent in chester as grand as the occasion be be disappoint by the content of the king speech have look for what it will mean for my constituent especially as so many continue to face the gruelling challenge of the cost of living crisis sadly it offer they nothing propose just bills it be clear that the government have simply run out of idea six bills have be carry over from the last session and any that be mean to address important reform such as the long await leasehold reform an important issue to people across the country appear to have be water down from what be originally promise we shall see some promise have be completely omit include the shameful turn on ban conversion therapy that move have abandon people who face this abusive practice change be key theme in last week speech and agree that the country be cry out for change however that change can not come about with the continuation of this conservative government the same government who crash the economy just over year ago plunge so many hard work people into further uncertainty about their life and finance the lack of ambition in the legislative programme for the next session simply do not address the serious challenge face the country the chancellor and the prime minister promise grow economy and instead we be see growth flatlining the bank of england downgrade its economic forecast and the international monetary fund forecasting that the uk will have the low growth in the next year as we have hear taxis be the high they have be for year with household pay staggering more in tax each year mortgage and rent have skyrocket with home ownership be very distant dream for many young people housing be the most prominent issue face my constituent in chester and the king speech have fail to deliver with no sign of local housing target or the need reform of our planning system it be clear that this government have no plan to fix the housing emergency the worry do not stop there they be everywhere we look our council school hospital police and fire service be all starve of resource local authority be face serious financial challenge know that cheshire west and chester council be deal with an unprecedented number of child in care with never before see level of complexity which will impact on all aspect of the council finance it do not use to be like this and it do not have to be labour have plan to make work people in all part of the country well off by grow the economy boost wage and bring down bill labour have plan to retrofit million home which present an ambitious opportunity to boost growth cut bill and develop skill labour would deliver by make britain clean energy superpower build an nhs fit for the future make britain street safe and break down the barrier to opportunity at every stage that be the real change that people not only in chester but up and down the country be cry out for the king speech be yet another lose opportunity to deal with the cost of living crisis the climate catastrophe and the scandalous underfunding of public service in my country of cymru wales and across the uk this government priority remain tax cut for wealthy minority of the type that crash the economy last year which the shadow chancellor amendment today seek to prevent as the tuc have say the uk be stick in conservative doom loop which amount to low growth terrible living standard and repeat dos of austerity our distorted economy be still able to deliver million of pound to few at the top just so long as million at the bottom accept live on few crumb here and there the king speech do nothing to deal with those problem on pay the government should have pledge to legislate so that they always deliver pay rise for public sector worker that at least match inflation and provide pay restoration we must ensure that our hard worker do not receive real term pay cut again and that their salary match real value in society the government must address that issue and do that in the autumn statement on social security we need payment to rise but we hear that the government plan to make new saving they be reportedly plan to cut billion from health relate benefit which will accord to more than disability organisation plunge disabled people into poverty and could lead to unnecessary death on energy bill we have hear the energy secretary tell we the oil and gas stunt in the speech will not necessarily bring energy bill down what we should be do be cut out the vast waste of shareholder dividend payment and restore energy provision to the public sector unlike the hon member for delyn mr roberts who speak early strongly believe that we need more devolution in wales we need fair need funding settlement devolution of the crown estate and the billion owe to we in consequential from the england only project could go on want to focus my final comment on public sector funding the welsh government have announce in recent week that they have to find saving of million to balance their budget and maintain health spending that be solely down to uk austerity and conservative economic agenda that harm our welsh economy welsh public service and the living standard of welsh people one in four people in wales be eat small meal or skip meal altogether almost million people in britain be use food bank as usual it be the poor in society who be pay the high price which be why be support our local tuc in organise hunger march later this month community such as mine in cynon valley and across rhondda cynon taf organise the first hunger march to london back in and it be sad reflection on and indictment of our society that we be have to do the same again in the impact of repeat round of austerity and the extractive nature of the economy mean that there be need and desire to look at new economic model at integrate community base economic and social development in wales this be be do under vision of cymunedoli which translate as communitisation and be similar to community wealth building cymunedoli be an economic model that ensure that community own and manage their resource and labour rather than be exploit for the benefit of other as have long be the case throughout welsh history fair inclusive prosperous and sustainable economy be create for the benefit of everyone through generate and retain wealth within local community the example of cymunedoli that be be pursue in wales be successful local investment in job pay for local training pay local supplier and staff and finance recycle and retain within the local community rather than extract we need to see more of that the tory government have spend year cut service and create cost of living crisis that have to stop now and we need the tories out diolch yn fawr those who have participate in the debate should aim to be in the chamber for about we be now face the year of conservative rule in that time the conservatives have preside over the bad growth in gdp per head since record begin sustained decline in living standard and huge housing crisis while our public service be disintegrate it be clear that the economic policy of the past decade have totally fail to address the big challenge face in our everyday society we be in the midst of the bad pay crisis since the battle of waterloo real income be still below level of in fact our entire economic system be stagnant economic disaster zone as the new economics foundation have put it stitch up between large distant institution and large distant corporation my constituent in ilford south feel the full force of this economic malaise every day whether it be in the shop navigate the ever grow price of basic good with an ever shrink pay packet or perhaps most acutely in their very home where they face ever rise rent crumble house and the constant threat of no fault eviction the private rented sector be the bad case of this highly deregulated mess that have enable rent to skyrocket as quality decline with freeholder look to grab as much ground rent as possible the english housing survey say that almost quarter of occupy private rented property amount to nearly million property fail the decent home standard private tenant be almost three time as likely to be expose to damp and mould as social housing tenant even if the property tenant reside in be liveable there be always the loom threat of section no fault eviction since the government first promise to end section no fault eviction over household have be evict and threaten with homelessness and in the past few month section claim have rise by shocking section be now lead cause of homelessness in this country but it can also be use as weapon by unscrupulous landlord to quash any demand from tenant who complain about failure to meet basic standard and condition while it be welcome to see that the government be finally bring forward the long await renters reform bill which will end section eviction it seem to be too little too late and appear to be indefinitely delay how much long do tenant in my constituency in ilford have to live with the constant fear of no fault eviction hang over their head the bills present in the king speech do nothing to address the cost of renting the past year have see the big rise in rent since record begin force private renter to fork out huge proportion of their income on living cost sandra in my constituency say to recently initially our monthly rent be at reasonable level but we be shock when our landlord propose substantial rent increase of extra per month as law abide citizen who diligently pay our taxis we find ourselves in bewildering and unjust situation it be dishearten to see individual and family who be once stable in their home be push into homelessness or temporary accommodation due to these unreasonable rent increase this will be familiar story to countless family across london as many london mps will know the average advertise rent in london be now record per month record rent be symptom of the housing crisis and broken private rent sector thankfully the mayor of london be urge the government to act now because london be one of the few global city without any form of rent control we can learn from international precedent to design an effective system of rent control for london our labour mayor propose two year rent freeze which could save average renter in london hope that the minister will consider grant the mayor of london the power that his counterpart in berlin new york and scotland have to introduce rent control this be fail sector that have push more and more family into disastrous temporary accommodation when speak to my constituent who be trap in temporary and emergency accommodation hear how they have be wait upwards of year for social home as mps we have all hear the horror story this be complex issue with no silver bullet the long await and yet far delay renters reform bill be welcome step in the right direction but it do not go far enough it do nothing to tackle excessive rent increase and it fail to close loophole that will allow unscrupulous landlord to continue to exploit tenant if this government and indeed any future government be serious about tackle this crisis they must go far they should give local leader the power to issue rent control and empower tenant with proper right and guarantee we need more becontree estate once home fit for hero not battersea power station monument with luxury flat for the super rich it be pleasure to speak in this debate on his majesty first king speech the prime minister be right to say in his response last week that the country need change but if the people of portsmouth need any more evidence that this change will not come through fifth tory term this king speech provide it it contain more word than any since yet have the few bills since and be perfect symbol for the late incarnation of conservative government that our country be have to endure it be party that govern with slogan rather than action and that promise to level up to provide strong and stable government to grow our economy and to cut nhs waiting list but the reality be that for more than decade now the only thing that this government have provide be an impeccable record of over promising and under deliver people in portsmouth be face serious challenge after decade of conservative government and decline with skyrocket mortgage rise rent soar bill and taxis at their high level for year it be sad but not surprising to see this week that the number of food bank parcel issue in portsmouth by the trussell trust have rise by nearly over the past year people be really struggle this king speech could have focus on tackle these huge problem but instead there be nothing to help people with the cost of living crisis nothing to tackle rise level of shoplifting which be now top incident per day nothing to finally stop the sewage pollution nothing to ensure that every child succeed and thrive nothing to secure the investment that our community deserve and nothing to address the fact that there be only one dentist and gp for every people in portsmouth those be the priority of the people of portsmouth those be my priority and those will be the priority of the next labour government sadly though at the moment we have to live with prime minister who have give up on governing who be content to carry on with the failure of the past decade and whose idea of change be bring back fail prime minister from decade ago with so few bills include in the king speech there be absolutely no excuse for some of its omission much need bills on mental health for renter and to support victim have be drop the failure to ban so call conversion therapy represent complete betrayal of all people at risk of this abhorrent treatment we should be clear conversion practice be abuse and it be nothing short of disgraceful that they have not be outlaw yet where this government seek to sow division labour will unite the country offer people hope around mission to get britain future back by get britain build again to deliver transformational infrastructure and home for million by switch on green energy to create job cut bill and boost energy security by get the nhs back on its foot so that everyone can access dentist and gp when they need it by end the tory sewage scandal so that our water can be clean again by take back our street with more police officer tackle crime and by break down barrier to opportunity so that young people future be not define by the circumstance they be bear into the people of portsmouth want new idea and plan to get our country future back and to bring about the change in my city and our country that be so desperately need this damp squib of king speech show that that change will not come with the tories it be become ever clear that the tory party be out of energy out of idea and hopefully for all our sake soon to be out of government congratulate my hon friend the new member for mid bedfordshire alistair strathern on an excellent and important maiden speech hope he will continue to serve the people of mid bedfordshire for many year to come want to talk first about housing because that be the issue on which receive the most casework in my constituency inbox in recent year we have see an escalation of section notice extortionate increase in private rent and general increase in household cost it be vital that the conservative government end the freeze on local housing allowance be also extremely concerned about the level of homelessness the demand on social housing provider in stockport and the financial demand on my local authority of meet emergency and temporary housing cost stockport have see significant increase in homelessness more than household seek assistance from the council in an increase of on the previous year and sadly see that trend become bad stockport be the good place to live in england but private rent have shoot up in recent year the housing emergency be now full blow crisis it be place those on low income in very difficult place and the conservative government be fail they constituent contact recently because her rent have shoot up from to per month cause her immense financial hardship that rent increase seem entirely unreasonable she now face an eviction via section notice from home she have live in for year at time of her life when she should feel secure and comfortable in her own home the current housing emergency can not be fix overnight but end the freeze on the local housing allowance would have an immediate impact on those in need ahead of another difficult winter for the nation people deserve the security and opportunity to get on in life but under the conservatives the foundation of good life be crumble homeowner face eye water mortgage rate young people be struggle to get on the housing ladder and the dream of home ownership have be snatch away from so many people who be stick pay unaffordable private rent labour plan for secure home will put an end to the tories housing emergency and we support fundamental reform of the private rent sector also want to cover nhs waiting list recently speak to constituent regard her mother who be in care home in stockport unfortunately the wait for an assessment by nhs continence service be week which be far too long my constituent whose mother be contact in distress regard the very long period of time her mother have to wait to get an assessment be tell that the assessment should take no long than week but in this case it take that be very serious matter and will write to the department of health and social care about it there be almost million people on nhs waiting list in england the prime minister promise to cut those waiting list yet last month they rise to record high of million people mean that one in seven people be currently wait for nhs treatment that be simply unacceptable recently write to all nhs register dental practice in my constituency ask they whether they have any availability for registration for nhs treatment in my local hospital stepping hill patient have to visit over the past year to get emergency treatment for tooth decay we be in crisis thank the british dental association for the work it be do on this issue but the government have forget about nhs dentistry and it need fundamental reform from the letter and email have have from dentist in my constituency know the service be underfunded and people who can not afford dental treatment simply do not get it they have to do diy dentistry at home which be very dangerous on local government funding stockport metropolitan borough council my local authority have deliver over million in saving since it be also face further saving of million by the current cost of living crisis cause by the conservative party be have severe impact on my constituent and on people across the borough of stockport the council need much great funding certainty from central government and the national local government funding settlement fall short call on the treasury to address that urgently will finish with comment about respect for shopworkers week which be this week we have see significant rise in physical and verbal attack and threat against shop worker the union of shop distributive and allied workers my trade union as former retail worker be campaign on that issue and the government need to bring in legislation to address it we need general election now so that we can replace this tired government this will be the last back bench contribution before the wind up the king speech be an opportunity for the government to address the serious issue face the country instead it offer little in the way of hope for the million wait for nhs appointment for the million struggle to pay their bill or for the million of adult who struggle to read and write and it dash the hope of everyone who be concerned about the climate emergency the nhs be in crisis with more than million people on waiting list for routine treatment in england government spending on health have not keep pace with need the rational policy maker guide to the nhs publish by the organisation present the average annual change in per capita health spending adjust for population and demographic factor by uk government since it show that the labour government between and oversee an average annual increase in per capita health spending of however there be an annual average reduction of under the coalition government and the conservatives preside over reduction of between and tory austerity be destroy our nhs this year integrate care board be require to make average efficiency saving of an eyewatering at time when we have massive waiting list not only do that deliver misery to million of patient but it be damage the economy as people wait for vital treatment have their recovery delay and so too their return to work government who fail the nhs fail the economy so urge the government to change tack and use the autumn statement to provide the nhs with the resource it need our level of poverty and inequality be source of shame and need to be address urgently more than million people in the uk include million child and million pensioner be live in poverty in about million more people than in the previous year analysis by the joseph rowntree foundation find that an estimate million uk household contain nearly million people include million child experience destitution at some point in shockingly the study find that rate of destitution have more than double in the last five year as result of benefit cut and cost of living pressure paul kissack chief executive of the joseph rowntree foundation say that the government be choose not to act olivier de schutter the un special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human right describe poverty level in the uk as simply not acceptable and say that the government be violate international law oecd figure suggest that compare with european union country the uk have high level of income inequality poverty and inequality be not inevitable they can be address through progressive taxation social security and investment in skill and education the government should start by abolish the two child limit and increase child benefit government who keep large proportion of the population in poverty and ill health be government who have fail illiteracy among adult be another driver of poverty and inequality in the king speech the government have yet again ignore the million adult in england one in six or of the adult population who be functionally illiterate poor literacy skill make it hard for people to get good job find and secure decent housing and access service and use public transport and it impact on the wellbeing and educational development of their child too call on the government to carry out review of adult literacy level and to come forward with strategy to improve they the climate and ecological emergency that we be face affect we all yet this irresponsible government have announce bill that will support the future licensing of new oil and gas field it be sheer folly for the government to be prioritise fossil fuel when we face climate disaster the challenge we face be immense and we need government who will invest in home grow clean power and insulate million home as labour would do the government have still not come forward with an outright ban on underground coal gasification risky technology to extract fossil fuel that have the potential to destroy the important ecosystem of the dee estuary in my constituency my constituent be adamant as be that they do not want to see ucg under the dee nor have the government come forward with an outright ban on fracke again something that my constituent and be oppose to call on the government to ban both those technology once and for all as matter of urgency this king speech show government who have no intention of address these very serious issue the future of the nhs poverty inequality the cost of living crisis illiteracy in adult and the climate crisis thank all right hon and hon member who have contribute to the debate this afternoon in particular congratulate my hon friend the member for mid bedfordshire alistair strathern on his brilliant maiden speech it be great to see he here today also thank my hon friend the members for sheffield south east mr betts and for lancaster and fleetwood cat smith the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee and the petitions committee for their contribution on behalf of their committees we hear excellent speech from many colleague include my hon friend the members for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams for birmingham selly oak steve mccabe for walthamstow stella creasy for newcastle upon tyne central chi onwurah for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill for leeds east richard burgon for south shields mrs lewell buck for aberavon stephen kinnock for enfield north feryal clark for norwich south clive lewis for leeds north west alex sobel for birmingham hall green tahir ali for city of chester samantha dixon for cynon valley beth winter for ilford south sam tarry for portsmouth south stephen morgan for stockport navendu mishra and for wirral west margaret greenwood that long list show the importance that opposition member place on grow the economy on the bedrock of fiscal responsibility we hear that from skill to housing infrastructure to net zero and public service to poverty and inequality there be whole host of issue miss from the king speech that we would put into labour king speech if we be to win the next general election be pleased to conclude the debate on behalf of the opposition this evening as you know mr deputy speaker be appoint to the shadow cabinet just over two month ago yet even within my short tenure already find myself in position to welcome second chief secretary to the treasury the hon member for sevenoaks laura trott to her place as say early look forward to hold she to account for what no have describe as her core task which be to grow the economy we all know that any number of conservative reshuffle will not hide the failure of the past year of conservative government indeed the late conservative prime minister be so keen to remind we of the past year of conservative failure that he have decide to bring back one of the conservatives fail former prime ministers as his foreign secretary promotion that we can only assume be testament to the lack of available talent on the government benches let we look at the king speech and the prospect for our economy the good news be that the late conservative prime minister keep tell the country that his plan be work indeed he think it be work so well that he do not put anything meaningful on the economy in the king speech at all the bad news be that while the conservative tell the country that everything be fine we all know from our own life that that be not the case and that their plan have fail we see the cost of living the cost of our rent and mortgage the spending power of the pound in our pocket and public service so close to broken that many people have give up try to access they at all the late conservative prime minister might have his head in the sand but we all know that the conservatives plan be not work because nothing be work in our country which beg the question why the chancellor be take more money from we than ever before thank to conservative tax rise in this parliament alone but most of that extra cash be be spend on pay the interest on our national debt to the tune of whopping billion in alone which be more than we spend on our school why because for year after year of the past year of conservative failure on the economy the tories have have to borrow more and more money to cover up their failure not just in response to brexit covid or the energy crisis but in each and every year since they come to power in let tell you mr deputy speaker it be work people who pay the price not just through their taxis but through lack of access to good quality public service people across the country will be say we have never pay so much and get so little in return how do we get ourselves out of this high tax high debt spiral of tory failure on the economy the short answer of course be for the late conservative prime minister to call an election so that labour government can be give the chance to clear up the tories mess for they the long answer and labour plan be to grow the economy so that work people be well off because all the prime minister manage to reveal in the king speech be his empty hand there be no planning reform to get britain building no pension reform to kick start investment in britain no industrial strategy and no new skill policy to help train worker for the job of tomorrow nor be there any fair choice on tax such as end non dom status those be all labour policy that sit on bedrock of our mission for the country as we have hear repeatedly this government be out of touch and out of idea only labour have plan to grow the economy boost wage bring down bill and make work people well off prosperity for every corner of our country can happen only with political and economic stability that be why we invite conservative members to join we in the aye lobby this evening to vote for our amendment which would give new statutory power to the independent office for budget responsibility an uncontroversial amendment that should not trouble any member on the conservative benches it aim to prevent from happen again what the former fail conservative prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss do this time last year when she crash the economy that be why labour government will introduce tough new fiscal rule to create solid foundation for growth never again the tory way play fast and loose with the economy and leave work people pay sky high mortgage we will roll up our sleeve and partner with business rather than step aside and let investment relocate overseas we will modernise our public service so that they work for patient parent and public servant once again and we will get britain building rather than allow outdated planning law and ongoing division within the conservative party to hold back our country the unpalatable truth face the british people be that each day this conservative government remain in power be another day when our country be hold back from achieve its potential and that the big risk to the economy be the conservative party itself that be why find myself in the unusual circumstance of agree with the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman who be until recently the home secretary she have describe the leadership of the conservative party as uncertain weak and lack in the quality of leadership that this country need could not agree more even conservative mp agree that the choice face the british people at the next election be between more chaos and uncertainty under the conservative that leave britain bad off and the security of change labour party that will unleash decade of national renewal and make work people well off once again it be an honour to participate in the debate follow the first king speech for more than year thank all hon member who have contribute to this debate include the hon member for bristol north west darren jones both for his warmish welcome and for his remark he and be both quite new to our post and much as we might disagree quite fundamentally on major topic such as taxis and spending be sure he agree that it be privilege to be close today debate during my time at the department for work and pensions see at first hand the impact that government decision have on people and the hugely positive effect that work have on household and region will continue to hold that understanding as take on my new role and look forward to work with member across the house to make sure that the economy grow that the wealth spread and that the government be responsible and restrain with the public purse string be sure the hon gentleman recognise as do that the chief secretary job be vital one that show clear difference between our two party and be sure we will have robust discussion in the month ahead very much look forward to those opportunity we live in change world even since this government set out their previous legislative agenda in we have see huge upheaval putin appal war in ukraine have now drag into another year of suffering and brave defiance the terrorist action of hamas in the middle east have cause unspeakable suffering in israel and gaza and all the while the spectre of inflation haunt the globe as the financial echo of putin war and the global financial crisis continue to ring out what will work to address they be the careful deliberate effort that this government be pursue which we will continue in the chancellor forthcoming autumn statement this be what the government have do ever since we come to power and this be what the king speech do now before turn to the measure in the king speech it be worth take look at what this government have already achieve we come to power with duty to tackle what be then the bad recession since the second world war million people be unemployed and million be stick on out of work benefit what have change since unemployment be down by million people and million have be able to lift themselves out of poverty thank to new living wage while many in the eu be experience recession here in the uk as my right hon friend the member for north somerset dr fox regularly point out since we have grow fast than france germany italy spain the netherlands and japan and our recovery from the pandemic have be one of the strong in the we have grow our economy by and cut our emission by almost since perhaps most impressive of all we have do this while slash our borrowing by between and the start of the pandemic this be what conservative government deliver here should consider the amendment in the name of the leader of the opposition and the shadow chancellor the right hon member for leeds west rachel reeves although will be brief as opposition members do not cover it much if their amendment have be in force in we surely would have find ourselves in much bad position it would have hamper the government from act in an emergency as we do during the pandemic because instead of take decisive action to support people and business up and down the united kingdom we would have be force into week process with the obr before we be able to deliver any support whatsoever be sure even opposition members would recognise that that be not an optimal outcome indeed the opposition seem to have put forward plethora of new spending commitment today prior to an update obr forecast which would suggest be not in the spirit of their own amendment turn to some of the measure mention today the shadow chancellor criticise the lack of action on the cost of living yet do not once mention inflation it be up there with the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband forget the deficit get inflation down be the ultimate solution to the cost of living pressure we face it require discipline unglamorous work which mean keep inflationary spending down there be not one proposal in the shadow chancellor speech to address it it be true that she do not mention the deficit bust inflation produce billion of borrow in her speech but that be another labour policy well overdue for turn key to drive non inflationary growth will be boost trade the brexit zombie on the snp benches fail to recognise the potential of the trade deal we have with the rest of the world my right hon friend the member for north somerset and my hon friend the members for crawley henry smith and for burnley antony higginbotham know the benefit that our open international free trading stance will bring deal such as the cptpp with the fast grow economy in the world will deliver the clear benefit of brexit and we should be talk they up not down indeed there be too much talk down in the debate today the hon member for birmingham selly oak steve mccabe ask who be well off will tell he who be well off the million people who have be take out of poverty since the pensioner take out of poverty those help by the drop in youth unemployment those for whom it now pay to go out to work child learn in school that be more likely to be good or outstanding and as my hon friend the member for west worcestershire harriett baldwin say the low pay the number of whom have dramatically fall since the national living wage be introduce since the proportion of people on low pay have halve my right hon friend the member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland sir simon clarke with whom hope to engage lot as hugely respect the work he do as chief secretary to the treasury point out the dramatic impact that conservative government and conservative mayor the brilliant ben houchen have have on teesside he talk about labour legacy there as one of mediocrity and failure and he be right with steelmaking back carbon capture and storage and new net zero power station this be level up in action and that be what conservative government deliver turn to growth and supply side reform which lot of people have mention today at the spring budget we announce comprehensive employment package design to remove the barrier that be prevent people from get back into work this be the welfare reform that be call for by my hon friend the member for waveney peter aldous and other at the autumn statement the government will announce package of long term measure create an investment economy by unlock business investment welcome the remark by my hon friend the member for stoke on trent south jack brereton about the digital network bill and the importance of broadband be glad to have hear the hon member for lancaster and fleetwood cat smith and for walthamstow stella creasy bring up childcare this be an important measure for growth as well as the right thing to do and hope that they welcome our million investment do not think that the hon member for lancaster and fleetwood be in her place but note her remark on sodium valproate and will make sure that they be feed into the health team that be very important on the supply side many member include my hon friend the members for burnley for burton kate kniveton and for hastings and rye sally ann hart the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands and my hon friend the member for stoke on trent south talk about the importance of transport in their local area and of protect consumer travel by air housing have be bring up by number of member we be on track to deliver the million house over this parliament and the chancellor be look at what more we can do to support planning reform particularly on infrastructure be slightly incredulous to hear the opposition talk about boost housing when they have just block measure that would have add much need home be in opposition be as much about what to support as it be about what to oppose and that be mistake however welcome the opposition support albeit grudging for the renters reform bill and the leasehold bill before close should mention the brilliant maiden speech by the hon member for mid bedfordshire alistair strathern whose beautiful constituency we have all be see little bit too much of recently it be gracious and accomplished maiden speech that speak to his decency in the way he conduct the campaign wholeheartedly agree with he that there be nothing well than to represent the place in which one grow up it be the world great privilege this place across the house do an enormous amount of good hope and expect that the family colleague and friend that he bring along today be proud to see his excellent speech and look forward to further contribution we be take the action that will make this country well the king speech aim to push the uk into the spotlight on the international stage embrace our role as champion of global free trade open for business and investment from around the world just look at our decision to scrap one route project where the right decision be postpone and kick down the road as cost mount up the billion that we be save by cancel will be reinveste to deliver network north improve journey and infrastructure between and within the town and city of the north and the midland instead of just give the people of the north quick way to move south the legislative agenda cut through the noise of those who want to talk britain down who speak freely about our challenge but be tight lipped on solution and provide clarity certainty and stability for those who need it most the last year have not be easy the come one will offer their own challenge understand those who want to wish those truth away but this government instinct be to treat the public like adult it be important that the public understand the challenge that we face so that they can understand the change we have make to safeguard their future this government legislative agenda recognise that balance the delivery of both security and opportunity the government have track record and long term plan to do just that and be hugely proud to play my part as chief secretary to the treasury that be why we will deliver licence for fresh oil and gas field continue to work to halve inflation and bring forward the trade bill cement our place in the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership lock in long term right for uk firm to do business in the fast grow region of the world none of this be easy these decision involve tough trade off but because of our history of delivery and our long term plan for the future capture in this king speech know that the government can achieve their aim for this country and help every part of the country to reach its potential commend the loyal address unamended to the house for those who be bit rusty on king speech procedure hope to assist will put only the amendment in the name of the opposition today other question will be put tomorrow question put that the amendment be make debbie abrahams rushanara ali tahir ali mike amesbury fleur anderson jon ashworth hannah

propose that this house do now morrissey thank you for call mr deputy speaker and be grateful to mr speaker for grant my request for debate on the funding of london bridge be proud to be river thames mp with putney bridge major and much love landmark as well as an essential road route in my constituency however it be not putney bridge but the closure of hammersmith bridge and its huge impact across london that bring here this evening congratulate my hon friend on secure the debate more than year ago ask the then road minister the hon member for north west durham mr holden for meeting to discuss the repair of hammersmith bridge follow up that request on at least six occasion but he have not reply by the time he be reshuffle yesterday do however receive reply to my letter to the secretary of state for transport after the cancellation of the future stage of have ask for little of the billion to be redirect to hammersmith bridge give that of that would pay the full cost and we know that the department for transport typically pay between and for strategic road scheme do my hon friend agree that the only reason the bridge have not be repair be that the government refuse to pay more than third of the cost and cash strap local authority can not meet bill run into hundred of million of pound thank my hon friend for make that important point he put the case very well that finance be available that it could come from the money allocate for funding for south east road and that hammersmith and fulham council can not be expect to pay third of the cost for this bridge which be very high and rise he have summarise my speech very well but it will be go ahead and hope that the minister will respond by use this opportunity to at last announce the funding for the reopening of the bridge here we be my hon friend and represent both side of the river and both see the impact that this be have on our constituent look forward to hear more of the hon member speech on this vex topic but feel sense of déjà vu because we have all be here before as she and the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter know my constituent have also be badly affect by this closure they be prevent from access school medical facility and public transport on the other side of the bridge in hammersmith and that be have really damaging impact on the local community particularly in barnes but while be concerned about my constituent it be have an impact on the much wide geography do she agree that it be affect not just barnes hammersmith and putney but the whole of south west london it be vital strategic route across the river of which we do not have enough and its closure be cause lengthy tailback and congestion in large area across west london and south west london and the wide south east and surrey in particular absolutely agree with my constituency neighbour this show not only the cross party support for the reopening of the bridge but the enormous impact that its closure be have across wide area of london hammersmith bridge be national transport route and the fact that it have be close for so many year be disaster for many people commend the hon lady and want to add my support for her request on monday this week the quoile bridge in my constituency develop crack right down it and it be now closed it be major thoroughfare that carry lot of traffic which will now be unable to go through downpatrick on that road for period of time understand the pain that the hon lady feel for her constituent and offer my support to she be intrigue as to how there could be northern ireland aspect to hammersmith bridge and now we all know well do jim it be huge honour to be intervene on by the hon member for strangford jim shannon just hope that his constituent will not have to go through the same enormous pain the long wait and the despair about funding as our constituent in south west london also hope that the minister hear that and will look into funding for the hon gentleman bridge as well the closure of bridge be dreadful thing at every advice surgery hold at every visit to business at every local event go to and every time go knock on door everyone want to know when hammersmith bridge will be reopen it be grade list heritage suspension bridge it be build in but close to motor vehicle in april when fissure be find make it dangerous boris johnson say at prime minister question here in this place on october that it would be reopen but it be still closed hold an adjournment debate on the issue in june last year with very disappointing government response the restoration have still not have its funding agree let alone be start or finish so be back here again this be london issue but it need national solution and action that can be take only by the government to fund the restoration it be disgrace that transport ministers have not sort this out my constituent be worried that it have become plaything of conservative party politicking with conservative mayoral and parliamentary candidate and mp stand next to the bridge say that something will be do and then quickly forget about it altogether the hammersmith bridge saga have reveal systemic failure in the way that bridge maintenance be fund that need to be urgently address by the minister while the government have drag their foot the estimate cost of the bridge have be hit by conservative fuel inflation and the war in ukraine where the steel be go to be source rise from the initial million to an estimate million the long the government wait the more the cost will rise the closure of hammersmith bridge since have have huge impact on my constituent especially in putney and roehampton an estimated vehicle use to cross the bridge every day as well as seven vital bus service those vehicle be now divert through putney which cause high level of pollution and congestion and long journey time so that the minister can fully understand what this closure have mean for my constituent will tell he some of the result of my recent survey of local resident and business over of business owner say that the closure have negatively impact their business because of pollution difficulty with delivery employee commute and low morale some of people say that the bridge closure have be extremely disruptive and that they feel more isolated and disconnected putney suffer severe traffic jam every day with child inhale toxic fume asthma level be rise patient need to get to hospital in an emergency be stick in traffic that be barely move it be also make cyclist and would be cyclist less likely to cycle because of the danger and pollution on the very congested road people who commute through live or work on putney high street upper richmond road and lower richmond road know how bad thing be and they need their voice to be hear the government should have step up back in april work with hammersmith and fulham council on the business plan and fund it and then they should have begin the restoration work we might then have have the bridge reopen by now instead they palm off responsibility and have play political game engineering work cost million start in february and will be finish in few month the carriageway will then be clear for pedestrian and cyclist which be very welcome but the full restoration be still unfunded architect plan the hammersmith bridge taskforce chair by baroness vere agree settlement of hammersmith and fulham council pay third transport for london pay third and the government pay third but the taskforce then do nothing else the taskforce have not meet since november no task and no force this third third third structure be very poor settlement as neither the council nor tfl can afford third and the government have not yet agree to their third the estimated cost be million but the council entire annual budget be just million business plan be submit by hammersmith and fulham council in december propose toll to pay for its third but nearly year on it have still not be agree and fund by the government hope the minister can tell we what will happen these sum be way beyond the mean of an individual council how can council with budget of only million year for library adult social care and child service afford to pay for this where could the money come from when it be announce that over billion have be carve out from the cancellation of for road infrastructure in the south east of england it be an opportunity to fund the bridge my constituent deserve to know why hammersmith bridge be not receive any support from this fund or from which fund it will receive support if just of the billion budget for the south east that be just of the overall budget be use hammersmith bridge could be fix and reopen after all these year of closure my constituent and people across south west london need answer so hope the minister can answer these question today why be it take so long to fund the bridge have funding source be identify when will we know that it have be fund when will the bridge be reopen for bus and vehicle what be be do to stop another london council have to foot such large bill again in future the closure of hammersmith bridge should be wake up call for the government to reassess the state of our bridge and the broken funding settlement hope that the minister will commit to look at the ownership and funding of all london bridge so that this hammersmith bridge fiasco be never repeat but why do hammersmith and fulham council have responsibility for this enormously expensive bridge the arrangement for responsibility for london bridge be establish by the local government act when the greater london council be dissolve and we have disorganised and messy hotchpotch of responsibility some be assign simply because of the name and so hammersmith and fulham council be responsible because the bridge be call hammersmith bridge that be ludicrous way of assign responsibility for national heritage landmark bridge and vital connection in our city transport infrastructure it be an embarrassment that as country we be unable to find political solution to this crisis hammersmith bridge be national infrastructure project in the great city in the world and the abstention from responsibility by the conservative government be shocking would brooklyn bridge or any other bridge in any other capital be allow to remain closed to all vehicle for year and year on end we urgently need futureproof reliable and sufficient stream of funding so that all our bridge be maintain for all who use they urge the minister to look into reform the funding formula for london bridge and river crossing so that another council be not burden with bill of million that it can not afford london borough be previously able to access support for bridge maintenance from tfl local implementation plan but the government restrictive cut impose on tfl mean that that support be no long available that will inevitably lead to more and more bridge needlessly fall into disrepair mean big and big bill in the long term so what need to happen tfl need new long term funding certainty through multi year funding arrangement which would make sure that council can access the support they need when bridge fall into disrepair without this investment cost will continue to soar with the conservatives kick the can down the road for future government to clean up if the minister be still convinced that this be not his problem hope that the million pay by londoners in vehicle excise duty every year which be spend on road in other part of the country convince he of the need to make sure that london road and bridge be maintain when they need it invite the minister to visit the bridge and request meeting to discuss the funding my main ask be very straightforward it be for the government to do everything in their power to urgently fund the restoration and reopening of hammersmith bridge at the early opportunity hope he will not tell that the government have do everything they can and that it be all up to hammersmith and fulham council to step up because all the leadership so far have come from the council that apply in respect of discover the fissure in the first place take action to close the bridge and make it safe the memorandum of understanding the proposal for cheap bridge replacement and the first project the business plan and the stabilisation work the government must now step up to shoulder their responsibility to push this through respond to the business plan work with hammersmith and fulham council and tfl and ensure that the restoration be finally fully fund also ask the minister to review the entire funding settlement for london bridge which have lead we here and why this most expensive of heritage bridge project be be leave to cash strap local council because of historical whim we clearly need new approach that safeguard our london bridge for generation to come congratulate the hon member for putney fleur anderson on secure this debate appreciate and fully understand that hammersmith bridge be of particular interest to her constituent and to people in the constituency throughout the south and west of london wish to make few preliminary point the first of which be that clearly there be good pre exist work relationship between the department for transport and the london borough of hammersmith and fulham obviously as the minister have to choose my word relatively carefully because as the hon lady will be aware the business case for hammersmith bridge strengthen work have be submit to both the department for transport and transport for london for review as she will no doubt appreciate can only say so much tonight to avoid prejudice any ongoing governance procedure and the borough future procurement activity however will attempt to address that be uniquely acquaint with the particular bridge have cycle across it many time in the past use to live in fulham back in the distant day when first become member here so be well acquainted with it clearly on my first day in the department for transport be delighted to be answer the adjournment debate on an issue that have inherit but which be delighted to inherit it would be sad day if there be no contribution to the adjournment debate by the hon member for strangford jim shannon like you mr deputy speaker fathom my brain to try to work out how on debate on bridges in london maintenance and funding gentleman from northern ireland would wangle in vital part of transport infrastructure that would make all the difference in the world but he successfully do so without interruption fear or favour and congratulate he on that look forward to his pitch doubtless in writing to myself the northern ireland government and various other local authority for bridge assistance have visit his constituency on several occasion and congratulate he as always on his support for this process give the minister comment about the hon member for strangford jim shannon assume he welcome intervention congratulate the hon member for putney fleur anderson on secure this important debate on the financing of road and bridge in london welcome my hon friend the minister to his place but hope he be aware that government funding for road and bridge in london be normally funnel and channel through transport for london he might be aware that the government have already bail out tfl to the tune of around billion in the last few year which be significant sum of money politely urge the minister as he get his foot under his new desk that he might consider channel that money directly to the borough in place like bexley and bromley as think that money would be well spend that way than through transport for london can be really cheeky and ask he to meet when he get the time to discuss my campaign to prevent the mayor of london from toll the blackwall tunnel which be one of the few crossing in south east london my hon friend who know very well have visit his constituency in former life make very good point he be doughty champion for bexley he follow in the famous footstep of james brokenshire who we all miss and who be my boss at the home office for long period be happy to discuss the issue he raise far he make an interesting point about funding go in particular way it would be wrong of to make first day commitment at the dispatch box but will take his point away and get official to look at it with interest and be happy to discuss it far the hon member for putney set out the history of hammersmith bridge in some detail she be right that it be grade ii list suspension bridge open in and have serve generation of londoners very well for some considerable time however there be few of her point with which would gently take issue first let we go to the basic the bridge be not own by the government it be own by the london borough of hammersmith and fulham it be not the responsibility of the government even if people have listen to quite lot of the speech they may not have pick that up the responsibility for maintain the bridge and make decision on its repair lie with the borough it be unfortunate that the bridge have to close first to motor vehicle in and then to all user in the reason as we know be that the safety of those use the bridge be deem to be of the utmost priority the assertion be make that the government have do nothing respectfully invite the hon lady to accept that the government have provide nearly million of funding to support the london borough to ensure that there be remedial work and assistance on an ongoing basis set that out to try to correct the record follow the complete closure of the bridge in the dft provide million of taxpayer money which enable comprehensive investigation into the overall structure and condition of the bridge through this investment world lead engineer work to develop complete picture of the issue that face the bridge the work determine the bridge to be in well condition than first fear lead to the bridge reopen on temporary and control basis to pedestrian cyclist and river traffic the department for transport have work closely with the london borough of hammersmith and fulham and with transport for london to help facilitate the reopening of the bridge to all user in that vein dft establish the hammersmith bridge taskforce which be lead by the transport minister baroness vere as the hon lady outline the taskforce be set up in and have have many many meeting well over since and it be instrumental in provide forum for interested stakeholder to work together to develop clear course of action to resolve the immediate safety concern around the bridge know the hon lady have call for further meeting of the taskforce want to try to address that assure she that when we be in position to hold further taskforce meeting it will be to discuss issue of significance or change for the project therefore ensure that it remain good use of stakeholder time however she will be aware that we have be wait for the business case to be submit and that be clearly the key part the commitment to this project by the dft have not stop at the initial million support provide to the authority in the most recent tfl extraordinary funding and financing settlement of august we commit to funding up to one third of the cost share with the borough and tfl of reopen the bridge to pedestrian cyclist and river traffic and then depend on cost to bus and motor vehicle the first part of this commitment have already be deliver in march the department for transport approve the business case from the london borough of hammersmith and fulham for the stabilisation work on the bridge which in turn trigger the release of furth million of government funding these work will ensure that the bridge remain open to pedestrian cyclist and river traffic permanently with no risk of further temporary closure due to unsafe condition be pleased to say that those work be due to complete very early in the new year and will provide certainty to the pedestrian and cyclist of barnes hammersmith fulham richmond and beyond that this link across the thames will remain open most recently as all party will be aware the department for transport provide the borough with furth million for the crucial geotechnical investigation now be carry out at hammersmith bridge which will pave the way for the next stage of the work this bring the total amount of government funding to the bridge to date of up to nearly million that be exceptional funding the next stage of the project be to strengthen the core and renovate other structurally significant part of the bridge the strengthen phase of engineering work will build on stabilisation work and upon completion will allow the bridge to reopen to all user that should include bus and motor vehicle follow close co operation with tfl and the department the borough have now develop and submit his majesty treasury green book outline business case for the second stage of the work to the department for transport set out the estimate cost range for strengthen the bridge the department be review that outline business case in great detail it be submit in on april as understand it so clearly that be an ongoing process the hon member for putney ask about the project and the funding relate to it but no decision have be make regard reallocation of fund the hon member for richmond park sarah olney also raise the local implementation plan it be true that transport for london provide formula funding to london borough for transport project but its budget for bridge project be just over million to be share between borough that be obviously insufficient to fund this project the minister stress at the beginning of his remark that the repair of the bridge be the responsibility of hammersmith and fulham while fully accept that do he not think it be in the government interest to provide more substantial funding because of the strategic nature of the river crossing would he consider the fact that as say early on this be about more than local transport it be piece of strategic infrastructure therefore responsibility aside be it not in the government interest to provide more substantial funding want to address the hon lady point in brief but be go to come on to the legal basis the practical reality be that under successive government of different political persuasion date back many decade the legal basis for this bridge and for other bridge in london be in relation to the local borough it be the case for example that wandsworth bridge require repair work and in that particular case that be do by the local borough she will be aware of the local government act the greater london authority and the action take in with the mayoralty and the creation of tfl which mean that significant road become the specific responsibility of with no disrespect the which run over hammersmith bridge be local road as be effectively most of london bridge make the point again under the highways act and various other act under successive government this be not the work of one particular government these bridge and road be associate with the local authority take the point the hon lady make and it be for that reason that the government have spend over million progressing matter as we have do thus far with no disrespect either to the hon member for putney who seem to suggest there be nothing the government have do and that it be all down to the london borough of hammersmith and fulham the million have be pay over series of year to get to the hurdle that we have necessarily get to and an agreement be enter into at an early stage do not believe can add anything far other than to congratulate she on secure the debate and highlight the issue which clearly affect her constituent and other in west london continue to assure she that the department will provide support to both the london borough of hammersmith and fulham and to tfl on the bridge project as it go ahead question put and agree to house adjourn
