wakeford catherine west steve yemm gerald jones anna turley the house divide ayes noes question accordingly negative unauthorised entry to football matches bill consideration of bill not amend in the public bill committee before we come to our proceeding remind member of the difference between report and third reading the scope of debate on report be the amendment have select the scope of the third reading debate to follow will be the whole bill as it stand after report member may wish to consider those point before decide at which stage or stage they want to try to catch my eye clause offence of unauthorised entry to designate football match beg to move amendment page line leave out or attempt to enter with this it will be convenient to discuss the follow amendment page line leave out or attempt entry amendment page line leave out or attempt to enter amendment page line leave out or attempt to enter amendment page line leave out or attempt entry amendment clause page line leave out from force to end of line and insert at the end of the period of month begin with the day on which it be pass many people watch and observe proceeding in parliament will wonder whether we have our priority right the bill be about unauthorised entry to football match in particular circumstance but think most people be much more concerned about the proliferation of unauthorised entry into our very country and the failure of the home office and its official to do anything effective about it in my submission the bill be trivialisation of legislation by home office official who should be do other thing but will not dwell on that now mr speaker the long title of the bill state that its purpose be to create an offence of unauthorised entry at football match for which football ban order can be impose follow conviction however it be about not just unauthorised entry but any attempt at unauthorised entry my amendment be design to exclude from the bill provision relate to attempt to enter such attempt be less important than actual unlawful entry and to include they in the same category be disproportionate and unreasonable when we come on to debate other part of the bill on third reading point can be make about the bill more generally but it seem to that someone attempt to enter football match without authorisation should not be subject to the same penalty as set out in the bill as people who actually succeed in get into football match actually july be quite an interesting date on this very day four year ago the euros final at wembley stadium result in the unauthorised entry of thousand of fan which cause lot of disorder baroness casey who be an expert on produce report be commission by the football association to look into that issue and come forward with recommendation in her report which span more than page she emphasise the fact that much of the disorder be nothing to do with people come in without ticket and tailgating in fact lot of it be attribute to other failure to enforce the law in particular the taking of drug and alcohol on public transport in london which be verboten and the taking of drug in the vicinity of football match which should also be forbid but be allow to proceed with impunity she also make the point that unlike at many football match what happen at wembley be largely exacerbate by the inadequacy of the stewarding arrangement as result of baroness casey report the home office decide to bring forward this bill however nowhere could find in the report any reference to the fact that baroness casey want to treat attempt to enter in exactly the same way as enter which be why have put forward these amendment there be no need to expand on that except to say that it be in common law normally an attempt to commit criminal offence be an inchoate action which can itself be the subject of criminal proceeding in those circumstance there would be no need to have this provision write into the bill it seem to that the provision would create penalty that be quite severe it could affect people ability to go and watch football match for many year into the future the presumption under the bill as you will know mr speaker be that if someone be guilty of an offence they will be unable to go to football match again as spectator my assessment be that that be disproportionate and unnecessary for those reason strongly oppose this aspect of the bill and seek through these amendment to remove reference to attempt amendment be another example of where we need to try to tighten up private member bills when they be bring before this house so that the government do not have everything their own way member will know that there be four other bills to be debate on report this morning all those other bills have commencement date but clause of this bill say this act come into force on such day as the secretary of state may by regulation make by statutory instrument appoint the question ask be why why be that necessary why can we not in this very simple bill say that these provision will come into effect either on the day of royal assent or within two month of that date that would be the norm what sometimes happen of course be that the government give themselves power and do all the talk about support bills such as this and then never bring forward the regulation the consequence of not have specific timetable be that the ball be very much to use that expression in the government court because they can decide whether they will implement the provision of this bill which have be put forward by the home office hope that when the minister respond to this debate he will explain why the bill have to be introduce by regulation on date yet to be specify of course the making of regulation be in itself further unnecessary administrative burden would be interested to hear from the minister as to why the bill be be treat differently from the other bills the government be hop will get through today rise to thank the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope for his careful consideration of my bill although be somewhat sadden by his suggestion that this be trivial matter as he himself go on to say we see scene at the carabao cup final that be very troubling and warrant full report from baroness casey she make an excellent report with some very good observation and recommendation indeed she say that there should be deterrent effect to any recommendation that be bring in submit that the bill provide just that also rise to oppose amendment to on amendment to and the issue of attempt entry attempt entry place particular pressure on stadium security and often require police involvement it be often extremely crowded outside stadium with scuffle struggle and chase through the crowd when people try to enter without ticket include attempt entry allow law enforcement to act before the breach of stadium occur and that provide an additional level of security be at the carabao cup final this year my right hon friend the minister for policing and crime prevention and be take down to the turnstile with the police we witness tailgating almost immediately we also see an attempt tailgating incident which involve man in his or early stand at the turnstile shout to the steward for help and assistance because somebody behind he be try to push their way into the ground it be frightening for he he stand his ground pay tribute to he for do so but it could have be dangerous indeed it be dangerous with the amount of people who be around submit that it fly in the face of common sense to release people who have clear intention to get into stadium the police tell that those sort of attempt be make repeatedly time and time again at the moment the police do not have the power to arrest they they detain they but then have to release they people just go back and try to get in again it be constant cat and mouse as it be and throughout that period people be put in danger from that action to omit the offence of attempt entry would take we no far from the current position that the police find themselves in include attempt in the bill give the good chance of equip the police to deal with this issue and keep everybody as safe as they possibly can on amendment regard timescale my understanding be that the bill be design to come into force via regulation so that that can be align with the start of the football calendar that will ensure that all relevant organisation have time to prepare co ordinate and train accordingly as crown prosecutor for year before come to this place understand at first hand the importance of allow sufficient time for change in legislation to be implement for staff to be train and for proper resource to be put in place by the police the crown prosecution service and most importantly by the stadium themselves be grateful to the hon lady for give way and for the diligence with which she have approach this subject include have discuss it on several occasion with she say that instead of date be specify in the bill regulation will be pass to bring in the provision at the beginning of the football season when be that be there particular date perhaps misspoke my understanding be that it be to align with the football calendar rather than the start of the season perhaps the minister can clarify that in due course we be now on countdown to the start of the football season my husband be season ticket holder for coventry city fc be very disappointed that we will be on holiday at the start of the football season in august obviously it be unlikely that we will get the provision in place by then but the important thing be to get the legislation in place in time for when we co host the next european final which be in think we should be in good time for that fix date of two month after royal assent would be sufficient time to get everything in place as mention early the bill have deterrent element to it baroness casey recommendation be to make sure that it be proper deterrent we need to be ready and we need to make sure that as soon as the legislation kick off we send clear message that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerate any long and people will not be able to get away with it hope have provide thorough and detailed response that satisfy the hon member for christchurch and respectfully urge he to withdraw his amendment rise to support my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope it seem to that the way that he introduce his very modest amendment to remove the word attempt be entirely proper support the bill but think it be quite dangerous to introduce an offence into criminal law of just attempt to enter football ground because it be quite difficult to gather evidence of or police that assure the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth that do not want to delay matter much will keep my remark short because support the general principle of the bill support make it criminal offence to actually enter designate football match that be in the bill long title and be something we can all agree on widen the scope of the bill to include attempt to enter ground be quite dangerous assume that the amendment table by my hon friend the member for christchurch will be reject but wonder whether it would unduly weaken the bill if they be pass after all the bill be about have legal deterrent to crowd of people seek to force their way into football ground but there may be many other way in which people attempt to get into football ground that be not riotous disorder and may be quite honest in intention when create criminal law it be dangerous to get into aspect of intention men rea as lawyer call it rather than in this case the actual legal fact of enter football ground if the law be not change someone engage in this bad behaviour could be punish only by ejection from the stadium but there be criminal law of trespass and many other way in which this very bad behaviour can be identify when baroness casey identify in her review the absence of specific offence as weakness in stadium enforcement be not sure whether she be refer to such minor infringement as attempt to enter football ground will say more about that in moment know that the key motivation for the bill be the euro final and the chaos at wembley when hundred of ticketless individual storm the venue overwhelmed steward and endanger legitimate fan that mass unauthorised entry pose real risk but that be really riot that be quite different situation from somebody on their own or perhaps father with his child attempt to get into football ground when they may not have ticket they may have be mi sell ticket they may believe that they have genuine ticket they may have be sell at vast cost ticket by ticket tout but apparently now they will face the full force of the criminal law under the bill police and court will be able to ban repeat offender as it make offender eligible for football ban order those be quite serious consequence for people who may not be rioter at all they may just be genuine football fan we be talk about fine of up to and trial in magistrate court know that such case will not go to crown court but that be still very serious matter for somebody who might just be attempt to enter place we will be tell by the bill supporter that its enforcement be practical understand how entry into football ground could be enforce but be unsure about enforce an attempt to get into football ground surely police and steward need clarity there be no point in we introduce more and more law when we have whole slate of traditional law against riotous behaviour law that may be difficult to enforce just bring the whole system into disrepute know that football club police force and fan organisation largely support the bill but be not sure whether they be aware just how widely it be frame be sure that if they could talk these matter through with my hon friend they would think his amendment be wise and moderate compromise because people already assume that it be an offence to enter football ground without ticket agree that the bill remove the gap between assumption and reality the other thing that slightly worry be that while can quite understand how such attempt could be deal with by premier league club which have steward and the whole panoply of large football club we should consider small club such as gainsborough trinity fc in my constituency these small club have face huge challenge and we be just introduce more burden on they during covid gainsborough suspend season ticket and capped attendance at just small club already have to deal with many regulation and with public health their finance be very marginal and covid worsen already fragile financial situation hope that when we consider these undoubtedly worthy bills as we look at the euros wembley and all the rest of it that impose more obligation on football club we remember small club the football association be not always as helpful as it can be with small club big club get attention and support so it may well be possible for they to police attempt to enter but it may be more difficult for tiny club very worthy important and wonderful club such as gainsborough trinity fc to deal with the intricacy of the law and understand it we be talk about enforcement and police resource and therefore the measure in the bill should be very moderate there would be fine or long ban order be we go to drag people before the court have already talk about the father attempt an entry could child or young people who sneak in without harmful intent face have criminal record be we really go to do that be that the sort of country we want to create we do not have lot of datum on how many attempt there be or how much unauthorised entry there be we should acknowledge that the euro final be exceptional it be unclear whether make this kind of permanent legislative change and reject the amendment will solve the problem on the datum the fa report that approximately people regularly attempt to tailgate at match at wembley and other competitive game at ground across the country it be not the odd person every now and again people be regularly try over and over again to get into football ground that be why it be important that attempt be include do the right hon gentleman recognise that the hon lady make fair point but be make point about small club we be here because of political reaction to the embarrassment create by one major failure but we can not base good law on one major failure that be on all our television screen we have to look at all club and consider all the difficulty that they would have in implement this change there be big issue with attempt tailgating to avoid pay fare on the london underground what do my right hon friend think about the bill in comparison with what be happen on the underground we know that there be an epidemic of lawlessness on the underground and elsewhere no doubt somebody will try to bring in bill on that as well and good luck to they but we be talk about very narrow amendment and narrowly focused bill be worried about enforcement which may vary between club or region fan may lose trust if they see the law be apply unevenly and do not know how club will police these attempt it be unclear whether ban order will lead to frequent appeal people would be try just for an attempt know that that would only be in the magistrate court but if they face long ban order could there be appeal we have to apply the law fairly and reasonably otherwise it risk be blunt instrument surely we should try to make this sort of bill tightly focus the amendment table by my hon friend the member for christchurch be sensible they would well tool the legislation towards its rightful end first they focus on the actual harm by remove attempt entry from the offence the amendment would criminalise only complete unauthorised entry clear fact that can be understand and prove we should target behaviour that truly compromise safety and public order secondly the amendment would ensure that the bill avoid over criminalisation criminalise failed or minor attempt could lead to disproportionate outcome especially for young people or first time offender my hon friend amendment promote more measured legal response thirdly the amendment would reduce ambiguity and the great danger in law be ambiguity attempted entry be vague standard and may vary in interpretation by steward and police if hon member try to imagine the policing of crowded football match with people pour in wonder whether they would start to agree that attempt entry be vague standard and may vary in interpretation we be talk about the criminal law we be talk not just about somebody be tick off or tell they can not enter the stadium but possibly end up in court the amendment would give clear legal threshold for enforcement and prosecution on the basis of which somebody can be try and sentence in the court fourthly my hon friend amendment would protect civil liberty have spend many long year and friday in this place defend civil liberty do not believe in over regulation and ever more law restrict civil liberty the amendment would guard against penalise individual where intent or context be unclear we be criminalise only intent we be not criminalise an actual fact and that be dangerous legal proposition if we start do it now on this bill where will it stop will we criminalise an attempt to enter cinema or theatre order the right hon gentleman be stray little wide into different area as he rightly say the bill be quite narrow be sure that he will want to get back on track this be about football not cinema be so grateful to you mr speaker you will be grateful to hear that have make those remark be draw to conclusion we have duty to ensure that punishment be base on actual misconduct in enter football ground not suspicion or misjudged behaviour fifthly my hon friend amendment would allow for practical enforcement focus on complete unauthorised entry would help police and club concentrate their resource on the most serious breach rather than chase marginal case the amendment would provide necessary implementation time the two month delay before commencement give football club police and steward time to prepare for the new legal framework reduce confusion and aid smooth enforcement finally the amendment would encourage propor tionality they keep the law from become an unnecessarily blunt instrument and instead preserve proportionate target response to genuine request call the shadow minister thank the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for bring the bill forward and my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope for his amendment at this stage be it correct that you wish we to speak only to the amendment mr speaker interruption yes we the opposition have nothing furth to add to the debate that we have have this morning call the minister thank the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope for table these amendment which propose two change first amendment to would remove attempt unauthorised entry from the scope of the offence secondly amendment would bring the act into force two month after it receive royal assent rather than by commencement regulation make by statutory instrument it be absolutely essential that the bill explicitly cover both attempt and successful unauthorised entry we have see widespread issue involve ticketless fan at football match attempt to force entry and tailgate at high profile match include the champion league final premier league fixture and at the euro tournament these form of attempt entry place significant demand on stadium safety and security personnel and at time require police intervention maintain provision for attempt unauthorised entry ensure that law enforcement can act before breach occur and thus maintain safety and security at football match across the country it also enable the imposition of preventive football ban order against person involve in attempt entry ban order be an effective deterrent against those who may seek to compromise public safety turn to amendment the bill be design to allow the measure to come into force by regulation on date shortly before the start of the domestic football season this approach will ensure that all organisation involve in safety and security operation be prepare to implement the new offence fix date two month after royal assent may not coincide with the football calendar or allow sufficient time for training communication and co ordination therefore respectfully ask the hon member for christchurch to withdraw his amendment the minister say that the bill will come into force before the start of the football season we hear from the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth that the season will start pretty soon within four or five week assume that mean the bill will not be implement until summer that be the clear implication of what the minister say if be wrong in that interpretation hope he will intervene because it be important to get it on the record that the bill will not be in force until year time on the issue of attempt listen to my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh think that have under egg the pudding bit because he adduce whole lot of extra argument that reinforce the case for remove attempt from the bill apart from anything else fear that if we allow attempt to remain in the bill the people who be still outside the stadium and never get in will be the easy picking they will be the one who get arrest and penalise while the mass of offender who get in without authority will get away with it because in order for any of this to work there have to be an arrest and subsequent prosecution wish to test the will of the house in relation to amendment question put that the amendment be make christopher chope edward leigh douglas alexander fleur anderson scott arthur catherine atkinson ellie chown deirdre costigan nicholas dakin shaun davies bobby dean samantha dixon maria eagle miatta fahnbulleh hamish falconer linsey farnsworth josh fenton glynn emma foody allison gardner amanda hack sarah hall monica harding carolyn harris

taiwo owatemi stephanie peacock emma reynolds sam rushworth oliver ryan tulip siddiq vikki slade stephen timms jon trickett harpreet uppal christian wakeford catherine west steve yemm gerald jones anna turley the house divide ayes noes question accordingly negative third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time it be an honour to stand in the chamber today and present this bill for its third reading particularly as lifelong football fan put on record that be proud everton supporter my staff have all too gleefully remind that this may be the near thing to football relate success that experience for long time our man team last win major trophy in and the woman in so be sure member can imagine my delight when see the amber valley codnor sapphire girl team win the plate in tournament in heanor last sunday be tell that two other team from my constituency sleetmoor lady and heanor junior hawks also win trophy that day live in hope that everton can follow suit and get their hand on some silverware at our new ground next season football have rich and impressive history it bridge community and bring people together cut across generational gender base geographical cultural and class divide it be sport of opportunity and hope that see girl and boy who begin by play on the street of their home town become superstar and role model with platform from which they can enact real change as we see during covid with marcus rashford free school meal campaign the rule of modern football be think to have be draw up in not far from this place at the freemasons tavern in london there among other thing the somewhat important rule that carry the ball with hand be not allow be agree on sadly the referee seem to forget that in the infamous world cup quarter final between argentina and england in which maradona produce his hand of god moment the introduction of the video assistant referee mean that today such goal would rightly be rule out not that we england fan be bitter as these example show football be in constant state of change and evolution it be not only right that as the sport evolve and progress the regulation around it adapt to reflect and facilitate those change it be paramount that bring to my bill which consider the issue of unauthorised entry to football match from fan safety perspective it aim to ensure that proper legislation be in place to protect fan and prevent overcrowding in stadium as we have hear unauthorised entry often take the form of tailgating also call jib that be where ticketless person push through the turnstile behind an unsuspecting ticket hold fan currently if catch tailgater will likely be eject without face any other consequence therefore ticketless individual can and do repeatedly attempt to gain entry to match until they give up or be successful this be not trivial matter it have significant consequence for the fan in the stadium and for the steward and security staff work there accord to the football association unauthorised entry to football match result in operational safety and security problem at major event there be regularly tailgate attempt at major game at wembley and at ground across the country occasionally there be also instance of mass entry where large crowd of people try to push their way into the stadium the potential consequence of this kind of mass entry be both dangerous and tragic in july during the euros final around ticketless individual enter wembley stadium it be estimate that around to of those individual get into the inner area of the ground two of my friend ross and siobhan be at the match that day they be both extremely experienced supporter of many sport and travel to attend game at many ground around the world they be excited that day to watch the game to experience at first hand the charge atmosphere of such significant match and to get behind their team unfortunately they do not have the usual experience that they rightly hop for siobhan tell we arrive wembley around an hour before kick off it be obvious that thing be not as they should be feel very uneasy about the atmosphere we go to the turnstile which be still very busy and there be people there without ticket who have manage to get through the first ticket check and be ask people to let they push through with they be to many event at wembley that be sell out and have never see it in such mess we go straight to our seat which we be able to reclaim from the people occupy they at the time and the row be overfill and the stairway be full of people the place be clearly fill way past capacity overall find it to be unpleasant and potentially dangerous environment it have put off attend england game and have be to one since my friend be not alone in feeling like that baroness louise casey be commission to conduct an independent review into the event of the euros final which she describe as turn day of national pride into day of shame the report find the drunkenness drug taking irresponsibility criminality and abuse of innocent people include staff family and disabled ticket holder be shocking and intolerable baroness casey also write there be series of crowd near miss which could have lead to significant injury or even death she conclude the exist enforcement mechanism available to the police and other enforcement officer do not offer enough deterrent against those determined to use the cover of football match to commit criminal offence tailgating for example should become criminal offence sanction for those break into football stadium recklessly endanger life be weak my bill aim to rectify that by insert new specific offence into the football offences act namely enter or attempt to enter designate football match in england and wales without ticket that the person be eligible to use the offence as we have hear be summary only and carry maximum sentence of fine it can be try only in magistrate court which will help with the big core backlog in the crown court conviction be likely to lead to court impose football ban order prevent the person in question attend match for between three and five year there be potential prison sentence if the ban order be breach the offence and the ban order in particular be intend to act as the long term deterrent that baroness casey identify need for in her report if pass the bill would apply to match set out in order make under section of the act as it stand those be match in the premier league championship league one and two national league woman super league woman super league previously call the championship and cymru premier league and international fixture hold in england and wales after do an interview with radio derby about the bill be touch to hear from my friend and amber valley borough council long serve councillor john mccabe incidentally he be also probably one of the long suffer nottingham forest football club fan he have sadly pass away since he leave voicemail message that morning which still have he open with his characteristic greeting ey up linsey before talk about unauthorised entry in his youth he say well do it be happen for year it use to happen when be about eleven they use to say lift he over he be alright but it be happen for year that linsey that well do stick with and his word and reflection on witness unauthorised entry age far demonstrate the long stand need for the kind of reform that the bill propose will now turn to some query that be put to during the bill various stage first the bill use the word premise instead of stadium to allow for arrest to be make and prosecution to be bring against people go through the first cordon where ticket would need to be display prevent danger to the stadium itself in committee the hon member for harrow east bob blackman raise concern regard the challenge of electronic ticketing and ticket duplication as means to illegally provide entry to match thank he for his concern and assure he that that would be capture by section of the criminal justice and public order act provision that cover the unauthorised resale of match ticket commonly refer to as ticket touting also in committee the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler ask about the change to the wording of propose new section of the act in the version of the bill promote by lord brennan of canton which fall at the general election the provision outline propose possible defence propose new section in my version of the bill have be edit so that it cover case in which person reasonably believe that they have ticket for the match but in fact do not that be to ensure that person who innocently buy counterfeit ticket be not criminalise under this offence which be specifically about fan safety and prevent overcrowding as before the defence also apply in relation to person use genuine ticket that they be not eligible to use for example an adult use child ticket again because there would already be reserved seat in the stadium safety would not be an issue with respect to overcrowding the bill it should be clear be about safety and the safeguarding of football fan not villainise genuine supporter the hon member for wimbledon wonder whether that alteration might have the unintended consequence of allow defence if person use ticket that have already be use regardless of whether they have do so deliberately promise that would raise that with the home office legal adviser and the office of the parliamentary counsel which do they confirm that person attempt to reuse ticket could not be say to reasonably believe that they possess valid authorisation to enter mean that the statutory defence under propose new section would not apply furthermore in practical term the court be likely to interpret the provision as mean that person be not eligible to reuse previously use ticket consistent with the intent to prevent unauthorised access to football stadium thank the home office legal adviser and the office of the parliamentary counsel for their help in clarify that matter finally let address why the bill deal with football match specifically of course the danger pose by overcrowding be not limit to football and be prevalent in other highly attend sporting and entertainment event however this be private member bill and as we have hear in many instance it be good to limit they in nature if one be to successfully change the law within the prescribed timeframe visit wembley to watch the carabao cup final with the minister for policing and crime prevention we witness tailgate take place and when speak to staff in the police they suggest that football specifically be an event at which unauthorised entry regularly happen and that it pose serious risk at the most competitive game in the light of the upcoming euro which be glad to say be be jointly host by the uk and ireland it be necessary that legislation to protect fan be pass as soon as possible so that it can come into effect and be proper deterrent beforehand if pass my bill guarantee that that would happen will the hon lady give way will make some progress thank you staff at wembley also have concern about upcoming sell out music event it be clear that unauthorised entry and overcrowding could pose security and safety risk beyond football and hope that parliament will consider legislation that expand the logic of the bill to address those other area include other big music and sport event on another occasion be pleased to support this bill lot of the thing want to say have be highlight by my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth it be clear that the number be stark and there be an issue the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope ask why this legislation be important and will say why and why it be personal for on january eight teenage boy from the village where grow up markinch in fife travel to glasgow to watch an old firm game at ibrox they walk together to glenrothes to get on their respective supporter bus five of they go on the rangers bus and three of they go on the celtic bus only three of they come home sixty six people lose their life that day in tragic crush just like hillsborough year later the trauma of that event still reverberate the grief never truly lift for the family for the community or for those who be there the name of ronald paton bryan todd and mason philip who be all aged douglas morrison who be and peter easton who be only be one grow up with their life and loss be remember by the friend who come home that day shane fenton and peter lee who have dedicate their life to this cause and to remember they those tragedy teach we painful lesson stadium crush do not start as disaster they begin as overcrowding as bottleneck and as poor control at point of entry and exit the bill will not change the past but it can prevent future risk we can make football what we all want it to be fun about whether your team do well or badly something to talk about with pal it be part of life but we need to make sure that we keep it safe this be about fairness most fan do exactly the right thing they queue they pay they be search and they have their teeny tiny bag that mean they be not take thing in they deserve system that do not reward those who flout the rule steward often low pay often young deserve to do their job without be overwhelmed or put at risk by hundred of people surge in unlawfully this bill be not heavy handed it be proportionate and focused thank my hon friend the member for amber valley for bring it forward and allow to represent and to record in this chamber the name of those who my community have lose hope that no other community have to go through that again rise order if member hope to contribute they need to bob throughout can not read their mind if they only bob towards the end it be pleasure to serve with you in the chair madam deputy speaker this bill be an improvement on its predecessor and give credit to the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for that because it allow the defence to which she refer in her early remark and that be well regret that she would not accept the amendment that would have remove the attempt issue but must say be alarmed when she say that she hop the provision in this bill would be replicate more widely in other bills would that be in relation to wimbledon or twickenham it seem to that the mischief be address in this bill be peculiar to soccer supporter be not sure about the suggestion that we need to go more widely to deal with this type of hooligan behaviour declare an interest as debenture holder at twickenham and have never experience the sort of problem to which she be refer when be at university can remember the first football match ever go to which be at dundee united stand on the terrace and do not feel any danger inside the ground the danger in dundee be outside the ground after the event then when have the privilege of represent southampton itchen be frequent visitor to the dell again do not see any problem there there be problem associate with the need to ensure crowd control and the football club pay dearly for the cost of police to enable that to happen that seem to sensible arrangement because the burden of police soccer match be not bear only by the local constabulary and its taxpayer but also by the club itself as baroness casey report make clear the wembley incident that prompt the bill be essentially one off incident cause by set of different circumstance include that we be still during the period of covid which mean severe restriction on the number of people who could attend such match other problem be create due to the absence of experienced steward and so on remember ask the hon member for amber valley why provision in this bill would not be include in the football governance bill which be discuss early in the week she say that although these provision could have be include in that bill because of her legal experience she particularly want to have bill in her name on the statue book hope that in the end those dream will be fulfil as that be an important matter for she have reservation about how this bill will work in practice and be concern about unintended consequence for the police if there be an incident similar to the one that take place at wembley how will we be able to arrest all those people every time somebody be arrest by the police policeman have to take that person away and put they in black maria or whatever which mean that they be no long able to police the ground fear that what will happen be that an individual will be pick on every now and again but when there be problem of mass trespass we will not be able to do anything about it because nobody will be able to police it we will get situation similar to the one in supermarket with blatant shoplifting and failure of the police or security people to take any action because they choose not to do so as my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh say on report there be danger that bring the criminal law into these area will result in disappointment and as result bring the law into disrepute we put all these law on the statute book but we can not actually do anything about they as say early the home office have responsibility for all this but every day we find that it be unable to fulfil its exist responsibility let alone new one that will be place on it as result of this bill most recently the home office reveal that it be unable even to record the number of people who have enter this country and then leave obviously the way to find out whether people who come in on visa be comply with those visa be to check the visa record when people leave the home office can not even deal with that we be talk about extend its role in the belief that some magic new bill will control unauthorised entry to football stadium when the home office can not even control our country border be extremely sceptical about this piece of legislation it be pity in sense that the private member bill process be give rise to this sort of legislation which be return to the word use early relatively trivial compare with all the other problem with which this country be face and with which this legislature should be deal the hon gentleman will correct if be wrong but be he say that the safety of those attend football match and the likelihood of they be hurt and in some case kill be trivial matter there be already law against kill people at football match there be already law against criminal damage there be already law against violent behaviour do not know whether the hon lady have look at baroness casey report on the incident at wembley in but it say that the issue of tailgating highlight by the hon member for amber valley be not the only problem there be also lot of drunken behaviour indicate dissent the hon lady be shake her head but that be in baroness casey report she find that there be lot of drunken behaviour and evidence of drug taking those be criminal offence the expression on the hon lady face make it seem as though either she believe that baroness casey finding be incorrect or she have some other reason for disagree with that think that bring the criminal law into this narrow and specific field when there be already host of other criminal offence cover these issue be the wrong way forward but be obviously in the minority on that we will soon find out of course will give way have no interest in intervene pardon order discussion should not be take place while colleague be seat if the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor say he have no interest in this bill then he do not have to attend think he be seek to intervene but he be not he be want to make some sedentary remark have put on the record my opposition to and scepticism about the content of this bill and will leave it at that thank the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for bring the bill forward for many in this chamber the euro final be rollercoaster of ecstasy and disappointment though appreciate that certain member from other part of our united kingdom may have feel little less devastate at the result beyond heartbreak on the pitch the euro final be day that nearly end in catastrophe thousand of ticketless fan force their way into wembley create chaotic and dangerous scene when disaster be so narrowly avoid it be reasonable to ask whether anybody make mistake sadly this be not one off incident tailgating be report again at both the champion league final and the league cup final of the arrest make on that day be relate to fraud people try to get in without ticket we hear from the hon member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray about particularly upsetting and fatal day these incident put genuine fan at risk and erode the trust that be necessary to police event of this scale properly for many people in this country trip to the football be the highlight of their year for many family it be hard earn outing or rare treat for their child something they scrimp and save for what must they think when they see hooligan jump the barrier and get in for free they must think that they be the mug for have pay and follow the rule in the first place it be therefore right that we give police and organiser the tool they need not just to remove people in the moment but to prevent repeat offence through ban order that build on step take by the previous government that see drug relate offence in football stadium likewise result in stadium ban welcome the clear focus on intent the defence include in the bill be thorough hope that the minister can confirm that enforcement will be direct firmly at dangerous deliberate entry and will not affect fan who responsibly pass on spare ticket target common sense enforcement be exactly the right approach to tackle this kind of disorder where new power be necessary the opposition will support their introduction the fa certainly seem to support the introduction of bespoke offence for tailgating however all too often we do not make enough use of exist power if understand the sentiment express by my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope who be no long in his place he be say that the law introduce in this place be often improperly enforce follow the arrest that mention early not single person have be charge bespoke tailgate offence will make little difference unless police and the crown prosecution service be willing and able to secure conviction we must support they in do so as well as in take other step such as co operate with stadium to advise on case in which stadium ban might be appropriate more broadly many of we be concern by the rapid erosion of the social contract across our society we be witness troubling disregard for not only law and order but standard of behaviour whether it be people push through ticket barrier on the tube as my hon friend the member for christchurch mention and my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick have highlight or migrant work illegally as delivery driver as my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp have highlight the principle be the same law apply to everyone or they apply only to those of we who be good enough stick to they which be deeply unfair if we do not take action to uphold those standard particularly when safety be at stake public confidence inevitably suffer the starting point must always be the enforcement of our exist law and we must give full support to institution such as the fa as they take step to improve safety and uphold standard in the light of all that be pleased to reiterate the support express in committee and confirm our continued support for this private member bill again thank the hon member for amber valley for introduce it warmly commend my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for bring forward this private member bill as lifelong football supporter she have make powerful case for her bill and congratulate she on secure support for it from across the house thank all hon member who have contribute today in particular my hon friend the member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray who speak movingly about her experience of these matter my hon friend the member for amber valley speak about the rich history of football the bill address clear and pressing issue the grow problem of unauthorised access to football match particularly at high profile fixture it do so by create new football specific offence of unauthorised entry to designate match it capture wide range of behaviour from tailgate and force entry to the use of forge document or the impersonation of match day staff crucially it will also enable court to impose football ban order on conviction provide strong deterrent and vital tool to prevent repeat offend and protect public safety the bill respond directly to the recommendation of baroness casey independent review into the serious disorder at the euro final where thousand of ticketless individual gain access to wembley stadium many through mass force entry or tailgating let be clear this be recur problem we see further evidence of it at the uefa champions league final which be again at wembley where group of ticketless fan make repeat attempt to breach security similar behaviour be see at premier league match particularly if away allocation be limited it be wide pattern of behaviour that need to be address such behaviour be not only selfish and dishonest but fundamentally dangerous it place enormous strain on stadium security create serious risk to public safety and undermine the experience of law abide fan the government be clear that it can not and will not be allow to continue that be why we support the bill force entry tailgating and so call jibbing be not victimless act those involve be often aggressive violent or threatening and their action can lead to overcrowding block emergency exit and frightening condition for innocent fan in some case individual have even attempt to bribe steward or turnstile operator to gain access that will be capture by the new offence the offence will also apply to those who knowingly attempt to use ticket whether physical or digital that have already be use let be clear this be not about criminalise honest mistake or punish fan who have be mislead the bill include important safeguard to ensure that individual with lawful authority such as emergency worker or stadium staff be not catch by the offence and it will not apply to those who unwittingly purchase counterfeit ticket in good faith or breach the term and condition of legitimate ticket that be point refer to by the father of the house the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh and by the shadow minister the hon member for weald of kent katie lam agree with the point she make about enforcement this be proportionate targeted and necessary measure it reflect the unique public order challenge associate with football which be not see to the same extent in other sport or event it be also consistent with the broad framework of the football offences act and the football spectators act the bill have enjoy cross party support throughout its passage and rightly so it be fan friendly measure that protect the vast majority of decent supporter from the action of disruptive minority and it will help to ensure that football remain safe and welcoming environment for all once again thank my hon friend the member for amber valley for her excellent work on this bill and commend it to the house with the leave of the house associate myself with the tribute to the ibrox victim give so movingly by my hon friend the member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray there be many people would like to thank for help to get the bill to this stage but first will speak about footballer vice captain and much love daughter and sister maddy cusack who live in my constituency in horsley and pass away tragically in september dedicate this bill to she with the knowledge that she would approve of its content give her love for the game and for the safety of the fan who come to watch her light up the pitch week in week out the maddy cusack foundation have be set up in her honour with the aim of continue her legacy the foundation have do wonderful work provide opportunity and inspire young girl and woman in football include sponsor local team to ensure that the next generation of footballer be equip to face the world in the fierce determined and spirited manner that maddy face it encourage member in their own time to look into the wonderful work that the foundation be do thank the football association and the football association of wales which have both support this bill the clerks and civil servant who help to draft it and offer support throughout the process the member who take it through committee and my hon friend the members for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales and for hartlepool mr brash who co sponsor the bill thank baroness casey for her report and the important work she have do around fan safety and thank my staff who provide continued guidance and support must also extend my thank to lord brennan whose work as the original promoter of the bill have be invaluable football be game of two half at the risk of create an overstretched analogy believe it be fitting that the second half of this bill and its journey should be play out under lord brennan capable guidance and captaincy in the other place should it pass today if the bill pass will happily pass the armband to he question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass rare cancers bill consideration of bill not amend in the public bill committee clause review of law on marketing authorisation beg to move amendment page line leave out and with this it will be convenient to discuss the follow amendment page line at end insert and set out timetable for implement any change in the law recommend by the review amendment page line leave out in particular amendment page line leave out three and insert two amendment page line leave out in the opinion of the secretary of state amendment in clause page line leave out from be to end of line and insert arrangement in place to amendment page line after appoint insert within the period of month begin with the day on which this act be pass amendment in clause page line leave out in the opinion of nhs england amendment page line leave out subsection this be certainly not trivial bill it be really important piece of legislation which congratulate the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur on introduce and pioneer it be not government handout it be an idea that he think need to be the subject of legislation and he have pursue it we have fantastic second reading debate there be tremendous interest in the bill may therefore make it clear at the outset that my amendment be design to try to strengthen the bill rather than anything else explain my position to the hon gentleman yesterday he say understandably that to large extent he be constrain because he be try to negotiate with the government and with the department of health and social care and unless he show himself to be reasonably compliant he would not have get the bill to state where it could be accept by the government note the different position on this and fully understand and respect the hon gentleman position the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh basically say that if she have introduce such bill she would have get so steamed up about it that she would have include lot more strength and safeguard and as consequence it probably would not have get anywhere near be consider on report those be two different approach be relatively speak neutral on the matter be sympathetic supporter of the bill but have lot of background experience of how government always try to give themselves wriggle room in effect to maintain control over everything and in my view the bill could be improve by be amend with the will of the house on report we could talk about take some of my amendment to the other place but the trouble be that the government machine may say that there will not be any more sit friday in this house so if the bill be to be amend in the other place it might fall completely because it would need to be bring back here that be why it be important that the house should consider these amendment now rather than leave they to the other place amendment which be to be read with amendment be prime example of the point make early we have commitment from the government that the secretary of state must carry out review of the law relate to marketing authorisation for orphan medicinal product that be for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of cancer great and prepare and publish report set out the conclusion of the review but what be the timescale for that and what will happen after those conclusion be produce there be no obligation on the government to do anything else the review and its conclusion could be just leave on one side we in the house be in position to tighten those provision up and say this be not good enough there should be timetable for implement the change in the law recommend by the review that be the essence of the two amendment to look at another gap that could be exploit by the government the bill say that the report must be publish before the end of the period of three year begin with the day on which the act be pass have table amendment to say that the period should be two year in respect of both those point have have helpful email from diana jupp from pancreatic cancer uk who write on behalf of more than charity represent patient affect by rare and less common cancer she comment on my amendment on amendment she say we be keen to push for this change with the department once we reach implementation stage of the bill with the great of respect to diana jupp we can do this now instead of leave it to she and her colleague to try to pressurise the department later we in this house have the power to change the legislation in the way that have suggest so that there would be timetable set out for implement the change in the law recommend by the review in response to amendment diana jupp say that this timeline have be agree with the department and in our opinion would tie into the timeline of other develop cancer policy implementation include the cancer plan obviously the most important part of her comment be that the timeline have be agree with the department because if it have not be the department and the minister would not have take the bill forward in this way and agree to it on the timeline draw the house attention to the evidence base set out in the impact assessment it say that the whole process will take one year the department reckon that it will cost and set out how many full time equivalent civil servant will be involve in it if it will only take one year why be we say that it need to have three year that be an example of why we need to tighten up the bill because if this be review that need to and will be carry out why do we not get on with it to suggest that it will take long than year be to go against the department own evidence set out in the impact assessment the impact assessment say on page under the heading mandate government review of the orphan drug regulation this will place duty on the government to publish review which will be comparison of orphan drug regulations specifically part of the human medicines regulations and international regulatory approach to support the research and development of orphan medicinal product that be for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of cancer since the review be concern with orphan drug regulation it be by default cover rare cancer the finding should be publish within year on page paragraph on financial cost say it be difficult to estimate the resource cost require for the orphan drug review since the exact scope remain to be agree however we estimate the cost to the department of health and social care to produce and publish report on orphan drug regulations to incur cost of approximately in relation to staff resource this reflect the cost of scs staff fte grade or grade staff grade staff and seo staff for one year that be what the government say only one year will be necessary in that case why be my generous amendment which would restrict the period from three year to two year unacceptable to the government there be history of dragging of foot at the department of health and social care be afraid we certainly hear about that on second reading give the house that specific example of why on the government own evidence they should accept the change from three year to two amendment would leave out in particular from line which read in carry out the review the secretary of state must in particular consider regulatory approach in other country the amendment be intend to probe rather than anything else why do the word in particular need to be incorporate surely it would be simple to say that the secretary of state must consider regulatory approach in other stop period but that be not how it be at the moment amendment would leave out the reference to the secretary of state this be to do with the definition of rare cancer currently clause would add this wording to the national health service act the research that the secretary must facilitate or otherwise promote under subsection include research into cancer that in the opinion of the secretary of state be rare cancer why can not it not just say that be rare cancer indeed clause would also add this wording to the act in this section rare cancer mean cancer that affect not more than in people in the united kingdom that be an issue of fact the secretary of state should not be able to basically have veto over the interpretation of what be or be not rare cancer this be just another example of the control freakery within the department be sorry that so far the minister do not seem to have stand up to official who have persuade he no doubt that we need the expression in the opinion of the secretary of state again the argument be quite straightforward and the people from pancreatic cancer uk be on my side but they be obviously very keen for the bill to get on to the statute book we all have to recognise that it be within the government power to prevent it from make any further progress that be why it will be quite difficult suppose to persuade the minister to accept amendment amendment would leave out from be to the end of the line and insert arrangement in place to in this statement in clause in discharge the duty under subsection in relation to those cancer the secretary of state must in particular ensure that there be such arrangement in place as the secretary of state consider appropriate to why can we not just say arrangement in place to enable potential participant in clinical trial and so on why do we need to give the secretary of state discretion veto essentially over whether he consider those arrangement to be appropriate it seem to completely redundant unnecessary and indeed oppressive it be counter to the express wish of this house on second reading when there be impatience over the delay because of the need to get on with this and suspicion over the failure of the department of health and social care under not just this government but previous government which would be the first to accept to actually deal with the crisis involve people who be subject to rare cancer that be amendment be try to beetle through these amendment quite quickly madam deputy speaker so that other people can participate in this important debate amendment attempt to tie down when clinical trial will be able to be implement it relate to the research and the requirement on the secretary of state to ensure the appointment of person to be know as the national speciality lead for rare cancer but there be no timescale for that to be do so be propose six month there be wide issue though there be no reason why the appointment could not be make now there be no reason why it could not have be make when the bill be first introduce it be quite clear from the impact assessment that the speciality lead will be appoint by quango essentially which already have specialty lead for whole lot of other issue why can we not just appoint this person now it be say that the cost of the appointment will be mere do not understand why it be necessary to include in the bill specific requirement that the appointment be make when we know that the national institute for health and care research have national speciality lead for research delivery within the research delivery network their role be primarily to support research delivery in their discipline within health and care setting with knowledge and experience of the full scope of the nihr and the wide health and care delivery infrastructure in england the lead work with patient the public health and care professional include research and development community within the nhs and wide care system academic and life science partner they aim to ensure strategic oversight and focus on continuous improvement of the research delivery portfolio such specialty lead therefore already exist they do not exist courtesy of specific legislation require that they exist they already exist under the nihr why have the nihr not appoint such specialty lead to deal with rare cancer why be it necessary for we to legislate to require that but in weak legislation that do not set out any timetable for the making of that appointment that in my view be another reason for tighten up the bill the impact assessment under the policy objective state this aim to ensure there be adequate oversight of research delivery for rare cancer by appoint name person in england to provide leadership and advice for the delivery of rare cancer research it be envisage this individual would be employ by the nihr it be accept that that person would be employ by the nihr so why do we have to wait for that person to be employ and it be say that the cost will be only some year with my amendment be try to emphasise the need for proportionality amendment would leave out in the opinion of nhs england from clause as we know nhs england be not short of opinion but that be by the bye clause state after subsection insert in subsection relevant clinical trial mean clinical trial in connection with the research and development of orphan medicinal product for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of cancer that in the opinion of nhs england be rare cancer now have already refer to this the bill define rare cancer as cancer that affect not more than in people in the united kingdom so what be it to do with nhs england the definition of rare cancer be already in the bill surely it be matter of fact it should not be the subject of qualification or second guess by nhs england so why be it in the bill in my submission it give the department more wriggle room perhaps it mean that whole lot of people in nhs england will have to work out whether particular cancer complie with the definition of rare cancer that affect not more than in people there be another problem here the bill refer to the opinion of nhs england as understand it nhs england be to my great delight about to be demolish or rather abolish perhaps both demolish and abolish so why be we seek to include in primary legislation reference to what in the government view be already redundant body would have expect the government to have come forward with an amendment on that but be at their service as always and if they accept amendment then they will leave out in the opinion of nhs england and remove nhs england and any reference to that organisation from the bill hope be tempt the minister to accept some of my amendment and tempt other member to speak in support of they finally amendment again relate to clause and the disclosure of information for research purpose currently subsection state after subsection of the health and social care act power confer by this section to process information do not authorise the processing of information which would contravene the data protection legislation that be fine we can understand that but would be grateful if the minister expand when respond to the debate on what be then in bracket but the power be to be take into account in determine whether the processing would contravene that legislation if somebody could explain what that mean that would be extremely helpful we know from the note that the common law duty of maintain privacy still apply they be not remove as result of this provision so what do those word mean this be very much probe amendment to try to obtain more information madam deputy speaker that be succinct summary of the point be make and why table those amendment one or two people out of ignorance frankly have write to suggest that have something other than their good interest at heart do have their good interest at heart which why be put forward these amendment hope will get positive response from the government rise to oppose the amendment but thank the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope for table they for engage with the bill and for our conversation yesterday which really appreciate understand the state intent of the proposal although be not minded to support they over the last month have hold dozen of meeting with family survivor sufferer charity clinician and legal expert all with the aim of deliver meaningful change in this field those meeting be not so that could tell people about the bill but so that those people could shape the bill fear that if we be to pass these amendment they would upset the delicate balance of hope and aspiration that underpin the bill it be not just about the minister as the hon member suggest there be whole coalition of people who have different opinion about the bill and do not think any one person have right to change it in that way include that would be hugely disrespectful and disappointment to that coalition but understand the hon member point the minister will go through the amendment in turn so will focus on three key one the review of orphan drug be one of the hard fight thing in the negotiation with the department and charity but we find point that we could all agree on appreciate that the hon member want it to go far and perhaps we could speculate about the outcome and well prepare for it but it be much await by the charity and they be grateful for it do not want to speak on their behalf but that be what have hear from they that cover amendment and amendment be about the definition of rare cancer which be an aspect of the bill that have not speak about in any great detail so it be worth touch on here the bill set the definition of rare cancer in statute and align it with the definition of rare disease which be useful simplification in future let we hope that some condition fall out of that rare specification and need less emphasis and let we also hope that people in the department look at the treatment that be be develop inside and outside the uk it be right that there should be bit of flexibility at the edge of what the department consider rare cancer the timeline of the review be three year again we spend great deal of time talk about that for some while it be go to be much long than three year and all of we want it to be much short but that be the compromise we reach it be like goldilocks and the three bears we reach that compromise together so urge the hon member to respect our negotiation on that issue hear what the hon member be say but why do the impact assessment say that the cost be for staff for only one year if the review will take three year why be the staff fund for only one thank the hon member for that question of course the review will not start on day one after pass the bill it will take time to get up and run the exist workload of those staff member will have to be reallocate and hope and expect there to be some initial engagement with the sector both charity and pharmaceutical company so bit of flexibility be require to be honest would love more money to be spend on that review so that we can get more depth and it can have great impact be sure other hon member present would agree hope the hon member for christchurch understand my position and recognise the strength of cross party and sector wide support that have bring the bill this far regret not invite he to take part in the bill committee we would have benefit from some of these comment at that stage but some of the point that have be raise be discuss in committee it be reasonably long discussion it do not last for hour but it be not as short as some remain committed to work constructively with colleague as the bill progress beyond today let we hope it get beyond today but respectfully ask in the strong possible term that these amendment be not press if they be hope member will oppose they to your delight be sure madam deputy speaker and to the delight of the whole house especially that of the government whips be not go to speak for very long on report although be not promise not to speak for some time on third reading wish to briefly speak to amendment and table by my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope before that though congratulate the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur on the bill be generally supportive of it and think it be entirely necessary turn to the amendment my hon friend the member for christchurch be right it do concern that the word the opinion of the secretary of state be include propose new subsection of section of the national health service act as my hon friend have point out propose new subsection of section and propose new subsection of section of the health and social care act set out the definition of rare cancer and if the bill pass that definition will become law therefore think there be contradiction within this piece of legislation it contain an absolute definition of rare cancer but add some ambiguity by refer to the opinion of the secretary of state ask the minister to explain how both those thing can be true if the secretary of state decide that there be some other definition of rare cancer how can that possibly be in line with the definition that be write into the law as the hon member for edinburgh south west have say the definition that have be include in the bill that rare cancer be cancer that affect not more than in people in the united kingdom align it with the uk rare disease framework which be publish by lord bethell in the other place in it seem to that that be an effective and suitable definition so again ask the minister whether he expect there to be some other definition if he do not expect that why be it necessary to include the word the opinion of the secretary of state the bill be not even consistent propose new subsection of section of the national health service act refer to the opinion of the secretary of state but propose new subsection of section of the health and social care act talk about the opinion of nhs england as my hon friend the member for christchurch have point out nhs england be fortunately go to be abolish very soon when that happen will we have to pass either primary legislation or secondary legislation to delete those word from the bill would it not be well if we delete the word the opinion of nhs england now why will the minister not consider remove they if there be some reason why he think the secretary of state might have to change the definition why be those two clause of the bill not consistent hope hon member will see that what the hon member for christchurch and be try to achieve certainly through amendment and be to establish clear definition of rare cancer we be aim to ensure that there be no ambiguity in that definition and if there be to be ambiguity we want to at least ensure that the body or authority that be go to make any change be consistent in the legislation call the shadow minister rise to speak on behalf of his majesty official opposition in support of the rare cancers bill and to welcome its thoughtful and necessary intervention on behalf of group of patient who have be under research under represent and under acknowledge for too long commend the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur on bring this bill forward and on his ongoing dedication to the issue the case for the bill be clear rare cancer define in line with the uk rare disease framework as condition affect few than one in people be individually uncommon but collectively account for more than of all cancer diagnosis however as we know patient with rare cancer routinely face delay diagnosis limited treatment option and far few opportunity to participate in clinical research the bill do not claim to be silver bullet but it do mark significant step forward in how we think about and legislate for research regulation and datum access in rare cancer care it be focused proportionate and strategically align with the exist nhs and national institute for health and care research framework clause place duty on the secretary of state to carry out review of the law relate to marketing authorisation for orphan medicinal product that be for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of cancer it also rightly require that the review include comparison with regulatory approach in other country this be vital the explanatory note rightly observe that research into rare cancer be often commercially unattractive because of small patient population and high developmental cost if our regulatory environment create further barrier to entry patient suffer not because the science do not exist but because the system do not support it the uk current approach to orphan designation lack the pre authorisation incentive find in system such as the european medicines agency and the us food and drug administration the review require under the bill be the opportunity to ask whether we be do enough to attract the research and development that rare cancer patient deserve be not quite sure whether my hon friend be respond to the amendment or make third reading speech hope he will address the amendment have table include those that relate to clause about which he have just speak if my hon friend bear with will turn directly to his amendment it be important to first set out the context because we must understand the clause if we be to debate the amendment to they clause make crucial change to the secretary of state duty under the national health service act by state explicitly that it must include research into cancer that in the opinion of the secretary of state be rare although this matter the research agenda be often drive by number and funding scale by mandate that rare cancer be part of the agenda the bill begin to shift the culture towards inclusion equity and long term thinking particularly welcome the creation of the national specialty lead for rare cancer model the nihr exist structure of research delivery leader this individual will be task with promote and facilitate research advise on trial design and convening collaboration the success of this role will depend on it not just be symbolically support but have clear remit adequate funding and strategic alignment with the wide nihr research delivery network clause amend section of the health and social care act to allow nhs england to disclose information from cancer registry for the purpose of identify and contact potential clinical trial participant this be significant and necessary step the bill distinguish between disease registry like the national disease registration service and contact registry such as be part of research make sure that these system can speak to each other will be of significant benefit when it come to match patient with opportunity importantly the clause reaffirm that any such datum sharing must remain compliant with the data protection act as propose new subsection to the act make clear power confer by this section to process information do not authorise the processing of information which would contravene the data protection legislation this be safeguard that we must preserve not weaken if we be to maintain public trust in the system at this point turn to the amendment table by my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope he approach private member bills in the way that jeweller examine diamond with magnifying glass steady hand and absolutely no tolerance for flaw we may grumble as the clock tick on but deep down we all sleep well know that he be read the footnote this bill be no different he have approach it with rigour and thank he for his commitment to precision and improve clarity and accountability as he point out the bill be not trivial therefore it be not only right but indeed the duty of this house to scrutinise closely legislation and amendment lay before we to that end several of the amendment aim to tighten the bill draft or introduce firm deadline for example amendment would reduce the timeframe for the review under clause from three year to two amendment would require the secretary of state to set out timetable for implement any change in the law recommend by the review understand the concern that review can drift but the three year period reflect the complexity of the subject uk wide review of the human medicines regulations include benchmarke against other jurisdiction and engage multiple agency compress the timeline might jeopardise the depth or quality of the analysis likewise statutory timetable for implementation could constrain the government prematurely before the review conclusion be even know be very grateful to my hon friend for his unprompted comment he will know that the funding be sufficient to staff the review only for one year if there be only fund for one year why do it take three my hon friend know far well than not to look at legislation in isolation the government will at some point bring forward the cancer plan which will have direct crossover with the bill so it be right to give the government the freedom and space to implement the legislation if we rush it we could get it wrong which would be even more detrimental for those who suffer with rare cancer other amendment address definition and discretion for example amendment would remove in the opinion of the secretary of state from the definition of rare cancer and amendment would remove similar wording in relation to nhs england discretion at first glance the amendment may seem like matter of tidy drafting but retain discretion be important especially as regard rare cancer prevalence datum can be uncertain or lagging and flexibility allow for expert judgment about edge case in which rigid definition may unintentionally exclude patient from trial or research that could benefit they on top of that there be concern even about simple definition we be still explore the difference between for example pre cancerous and cancerous cell if someone go for smear that be what they be tell this be new area who know what will come up in the future simply define rare cancer on the basis of lag prevalence datum be risk and it be therefore right that the government and the secretary at state have discretion to direct in one way or another however would grateful if the government would answer the question which have be rightly pose of who or what will fill the role when nhs england be abolish it be not clear exactly what that will look like have ask the minister this question several time in relation to the mental health bill and other area and it be question that this house should rightly ask who will be responsible for what when and why that say amendment which would ensure that the propose national specialty lead be appoint within six month of royal assent deserve serious consideration patient have wait long enough if the government be confident that the post can be establish promptly and resource effectively would welcome that ambition be state at the dispatch box today finally must express my concern about amendment which propose to remove the data protection safeguard in clause although the provision may be declaratory in that it reaffirm exist legal obligation it none the less offer clarity and reassurance in an area as sensitive as health datum such clarity matter and the subsection removal could cause unnecessary concern even if the underlying law remain unchanged in conclusion this bill be not about grandstand it be modest in financial cost careful in its drafting and realistic in its scope but its impact could be significant for patient live with rare cancer and clinician and researcher strive to support they the bill offer real hope hope for fast access to innovation hope for more inclusive research and hope for regulatory system that work for the many not just the minority every patient matter whether they be one in two or one in as we state on second reading and in committee we support the bill and thank the house for give the chance to explain why be grateful to my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for bring this bill before the house and congratulate he on get it to report amendment allow amendment to be insert into the bill amendment would require the secretary of state have carry out the review describe in clause to set out timetable for implement change to the law recommend by the review however it would not be appropriate to presume the outcome of the review of orphan drug regulation that be outline in clause amendment presuppose that the review will recommend change the law and that there be change the secretary of state would be willing to support follow legal consultation that be not consider appropriate at this stage amendment be unnecessarily restrictive introduce wording that confine the review unnecessarily we want to ensure that thorough review be conduct and my hon friend the minister for secondary care will be work with her official to ensure that that happen for amendment the three year timeframe to prepare and publish the review and the necessary resourcing requirement have be discuss with official in my department and at the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency remind member that the text in the bill reflect the statutory deadline but we will endeavour to publish report ahead of the three year timeframe which have be put forward to be consistent with the mhra overall workplan on amendment there be different definition of rare cancer and we work with my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west to agree the definition in the bill as cancer that affect not more than one in people in the uk however level of discretion for the secretary of state be require over what fall within that definition since the fact underlie and the datum on diagnosis be constantly change the amendment would make it difficult to implement the clause in practical and operational term amendment would remove the ability of the secretary of state to exercise discretion as to how their duty would be discharge this be not consider appropriate since it make the operation of clause less workable in practice and would lack the government assessment of what in all the circumstance would be the most appropriate manner of implementation amendment would introduce specific timeframe just six month to allow the appointment of the specialty lead although agree that we will need to appoint the specialty lead promptly introduce statutory timeframe be not consider workable for practical reason there could be unforeseen delay for example recruitment process might delay the appointment beyond six month on amendment as mention previously there be different definition for rare cancer that be because the datum on cancer diagnosis be constantly change and decision on whether the criterion for rare cancer be meet will inevitably involve an element of judgment the amendment would make it difficult to implement the clause in practical and operational term turn finally to amendment it be essential that information relate to people health and care be share appropriately lawfully and in line with their reasonable expectation amendment would remove the provision confirm that any sharing of information pursuant to the power create by the bill and under nhs england exist power must be in accordance with data protection legislation that include compliance with key principle such as lawfulness and fairness that layer of assurance be essential for the protection of patient and clause be standard provision that make that explicit for those reason ask the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope to withdraw all nine of his amendment sir christopher be it your pleasure that amendment be withdraw be it possible to respond madam deputy speaker very briefly be ask whether amendment would be push to vote or withdraw so if you could alert to that it would be very useful will respond briefly to the debate in so do thank my hon friend the members for hinckley and bosworth dr evans and for farnham and bordon gregory stafford for their contribution listen for what the minister would say in response to my point about nhs england but do not hear the expression nhs england come from between his lip and wonder whether that be an oversight or whether it be leave out of his brief deliberately by official from nhs england amendment specifically deal with nhs england and my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth refer to it do the minister reluctance to intervene at this stage show that he be in denial about the policy in relation to nhs england presume that he be in such denial we have have classic example from the minister of why the civil service be rule okay because it can come forward with valid objection to every possible suggest alternative and amendment do not think that this attitude will be very helpful to the people we be try to help through the bill namely those who be suffer from rare cancer and who want we to make progress in this area will not press any of these amendment to vote but hope that when the bill get to the other place there will be more persistent probing particularly on the issue around nhs england and the definition to give credit where it be due be pleased with what the minister say about the specialty lead as discuss we do not need legislation for this anyway he say he want to have that deal with promptly but be fearful of accept an amendment that require it to be do within six month because of the possibility of unforeseen delay take it from that that he be go to get on with that aspect and let we hope that that go fast rather than slow beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment amendment by leave withdraw third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time what joy it be to say that madam deputy speaker it have be month since you pull my little ping pong ball out of the goldfish bowl and start this journey it be worth remember that part of the reason behind this bill be the death of my father in law to rare cancer type call glioblastoma be forever grateful to my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh for the information she give about that condition and how it impact so many people because have always just be focus on my father in law when the ping pong ball be pull out of the goldfish bowl get so many email many of which be about glioblastoma the reality be that someone who be diagnose that day with glioblastoma would more than likely be dead by now that be how serious the condition be they would face treatment that be out of date and their future would be dominate by uncertainty we should not forget why we be here to change that reality for people and their family this bill have resonate with many member of this house and with many people in my constituency on second reading share the tragic story of young constituent call tilly who pass away from neuroblastoma and kira who have live with the same condition for decade half of her life be proud to wear the solving kids cancer badge which kira mother aud give when last meet she today also want to acknowledge the many people from across the uk not just voter in edinburgh south west who have contact to voice their support and share their story one lady travel quite far to meet at my constituency surgery in july in tesco in colinton mains her daughter be diagnose with sarcoma in tesco next to the bleep self checkout aisle she tell about the uncertainty she have face after that diagnosis and how she have find it impossible even to understand which trial be available let alone access they could see that she have feel powerless and have lose hope the other reason she be in edinburgh perhaps the most important reason be that she be meet she ex husband to scatter her daughter ash in local park what be happen to people who face these condition be quite incredible so it be right that we seek to address they it have be incredible to hear these story and when reflect on they can see that there be three recur theme the first be frustration as thing stand our nhs be ill equip to deal with these patient awareness level be often low among clinician which lead to the scourge of late diagnosis know that will be address in the cancer plan family and patient be also frustrate by the limited access to cutting edge trial have already give an example of that as result many rare cancer patient understandably feel like they have to battle not just against the cancer but for attention the second key thing that unite these story be perseverance rare cancer patient continually push back and advocate for the change that they believe must happen often fundraise or even set up and run their own charity to help to achieve those goal thirdly each and every story conclude with an offer of help rather than ask what can do for they because often rare cancer patient know that their option be limited they want to know what they can do to help with the bill help other with the same condition and help to make this legislation reality believe that be testament to the transformational role that the bill could have and thank member who have already make that point for far too long rare cancer patient have be leave behind as medical science make significant progress in many other complex field we have not see enough progress in this one but they feel this piece of legislation could mark meaningful shift for many and turn out to be life alter perhaps even lifesave for some there be one statistic that often mention rare cancer be not really rare as they account for of all cancer diagnosis in the uk each year that equate to people if you be one of those two thing be true you be more likely to face outdated treatment and you be more likely to die the bill be about justice and create more level playing field for those patient and their family it will achieve that by place duty on the secretary of state to promote research into rare cancer include appoint national specialty lead to co ordinate effort across the sector if anybody doubt the need for that be sure my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden can talk about what have be happen in recent year the bill will also increase patient access to clinical trial by strengthen and streamline the be part of research registry and build central database of willing patient to help researcher to find trial participant more easily that be key to attract trial to the uk lastly the bill will trigger government review into orphan drug really dislike that phrase this be about rare condition to explore new pathway to incentivise pharmaceutical company to trial repurpose and innovative treatment for rare cancer together those step will reduce the barrier to research and attract more trial to the uk and ultimately lead to fast and fair access to lifesave treatment be humble person and do not want to be accuse of overstate the impact of the bill so will take the liberty of quote other if member do not mind the brain tumour charity which have be so helpful say that the bill will be transformative and help to improve access to clinical trial for people live with rare and less common cancer another helpful charity brain tumour research say that the bill could significantly improve research and treatment pathway for patient pancreatic cancer uk which have be at the core of what we be do and it turn out have be in correspondence with the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope say that if the bill become law it have the potential to improve survival rate for pancreatic cancer and other cancer that have be leave behind know the hon member for witney charlie maynard want to be here today but could not be instead his sister georgie leave message on my social medium she live with glioblastoma and be fantastic campaigner in this field she say your bill will make significant difference help ten of thousand who desperately need more research to find cure no pressure therefore for or we in the chamber today there be also strong economic argument for introduce this legislation by create the condition for more rare cancer trial to take place in the uk we can attract investment stimulate innovation and create new job in research science and healthcare this be an opportunity to give british science and institution global leadership role in tackle some of the most challenging disease of our time recently have the pleasure of visit edinburgh university researcher base in an nhs hospital the western general in edinburgh be invite along to see thing call robotic microscope it sound exciting and be look forward to get my picture take next to it but it be actually very ordinary piece of instrumentation get my picture take in the end but do not think use it it be fantastic piece of equipment and it be couple with supercomputer it do what would previously have be lifetime of analysis in just few day it be fantastic that in this house we have all agree that edinburgh university should get new supercomputer analysis that use to take few day will take just few hour move we close to find cure the united states have show how investment in this area can stimulate growth through its cancer act it would offer real step change in the uk if we could do the same will draw to conclusion because know other want to speak there be strong moral and economic argument for this bill and the progress within it be long overdue once again congratulate the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur on bring this essential bill before we and thank he for the hard work he have do to make sure we get to this place as have say many time in this house early detection save life but without meaningful progress in research we will fall behind other country make major advance in cancer care we call these rare cancer and they be rare in their individual component but have be amazed by how many constituent across farnham bordon haslemere liphook and the surround village have contact in support of the bill and to share their experience despite rare and less common cancer receive more than half of uk cancer research funding in recent year staggering of patient survey by say that they be never offer the chance to participate in clinical trial that be not because there be no public support or because the science be not there but because persistent structural barrier be in the way the bill address those barrier directly if enact the rare cancers bill will appoint national specialty lead for rare cancer within government create accountability facilitate research and collaboration and embed co ordination across nhs england while it still exist the national institute for health and care research and cancer alliance secondly it will mandate review of the uk orphan drug regulation align incentive such as marketing exclusivity and reduce regulatory fee with international good practice thirdly it will adapt the nihr be part of research platform to create dedicated proactive registry that directly link patient with relevant clinical trial let we be clear this bill aim to deploy smart system harness the power of artificial intelligence expand fair access to treatment end the postcode lottery and ensure that every patient no matter the type of cancer have the opportunity to benefit from research and high quality personalise care let we also be clear about the need rare and less common cancer account for of all uk cancer diagnosis yet they be responsible for of all cancer death that mean that more than half of those who die of cancer in this country do so from condition that receive disproportionately less investment less attention and less hope the disparity in survival be stark for some rare cancer five year survival rate languish in the single digit only of people diagnose with cancer of the pancreas brain oesophagus liver or stomach survive beyond five year by contrast the five year survival rate across more common cancer be more than this be not marginal issue this be mainstream cancer care but it be neglect our international peer be take action in country such as france germany and the usa regulatory framework be actively incentivise clinical trial for rare cancer the uk meanwhile have fall from second to in europe for access to orphan medicine we must reverse that decline we must unlock the potential of our research base and this bill give we the legislative structure to do so the nhs year plan launch with the ambition to modernise our health service be wide range document it rightly champion early diagnosis innovation and personalised care and there be no doubt that many of its pillar particularly those on genomic digital access and therapeutic innovation can benefit people with rare cancer but can be not the same as will and should be not the same as must the plan set out national goal to diagnose of all cancer at stage or by that target explicitly include rare and less common cancer that be an important and necessary ambition but as campaigner have rightly point out without specific structural action on rare cancer we will not hit that target even bad we will leave some of the most vulnerable patient behind as have say these be not fringe disease these be mainstream condition that be under research and under resource the year plan include number of relevant commitment such as the whole genome sequencing of newborn support by million of investment which could revolutionise early detection of genetic cancer syndrome of course there be some safeguarding issue around that sequence do not want to pre empt my column in politicshome on monday but please read it for more about my concern over those safeguard likewise the plan include the expansion of genomic and pharmacogenomic service in the nhs give we the potential to offer targeted therapy for rare cancer it have pipeline for advanced therapy medicinal product include car cell treatment which be already be roll out for certain rare blood cancer it also streamline the regulatory pathway through propose innovator passport to bring treatment to patient fast those be step in the right direction but let be frank the plan do not go far enough for people with rare cancer there be no dedicated rare cancer taskforce despite repeat call from sarcoma uk and the brain tumour charity there be no specific ringfence funding for rare cancer service despite the complex multidisciplinary care that these condition require there be no rare cancer specific training pathway or fellowship despite clear evidence from clinician that lack of expertise be hamper outcome the england rare disease action plan publish alongside the nhs strategy take some welcome step on collaborative network and datum integration but rare cancer be again fold into general framework rather than give the targeted attention they so desperately need be here today on behalf of my young constituent imogen and all young people face tongue cancer it be rare cancer with frightening and disable treatment option be also here on behalf of my constituent ros who lose her mother to pancreatic cancer just hour after diagnosis do the hon member agree that this house should be unite in its support for practical target reform to advance rare cancer research which be support by more than expert charity partner and which so many of our constituent desperately want to see pass into law thank the hon member for her intervention she be absolutely right hope this matter have cross party support in the house as she point out significant number of charity across the country hope that the bill will pass today as do that bring nicely on to what jane lyons the former chief executive of have say rare and less common cancer make up massive part of the cancer burden in this country they need proper structural attention not just well mean inclusion in generic plan she be right we need dedicated leadership and single accountable individual or office for rare cancer research and care we need smart datum platform such as the adapt be part of research system propose in the bill and we need clear strategy for deliver orphan drug access so that the uk become destination for innovation not detour when the nhs year plan speak of transformation we must ensure that that transformation be inclusive when we talk about prevention early detection and innovation we must be honest about who get access and who do not if we be serious about improve outcome for all cancer patient rare cancer must not be treat as an afterthought they must be recognise for what they be major public health challenge hide in plain sight the year plan give we the tool but it be now up to this house and to ministers to ensure that those tool be use equitably strategically and with urgency that be why be incredibly sadden to hear that dr susan michaelis the founder of the lobular moonshot project die couple of day ago susan life and legacy exemplify why this bill matter lobular breast cancer affect woman every single day in the uk and more than globally it be not rare in the strict legal sense more than six per be diagnose annually but due to the severe lack of research awareness and tailor treatment it deserve to be treat as such by our system susan be due to meet the secretary of state on july this come monday to discuss how to accelerate the vital five year research project she help to initiate thankfully that meeting will still go ahead the campaign will not stop the lobular moonshot project will continue for susan and for every woman still face this disease without the research back option that she deserve susan be far from alone constituent recently write to about their mother who die in just three year after her diagnosis with glioblastoma multiforme an aggressive and incurable brain tumour the average glioblastoma survival time be to month only of patient survive more than year and just live beyond five another campaigner speak movingly about the delay she face before be diagnose with rare kidney cancer initially misdiagnose postpone by covid and ultimately catch too late there be so many rare cancer and the story repeat rare cancer be not rare to those live with they they be rare only to the system accord to jane lyons the former ceo of something like of all cancer diagnosis be for rare and less common cancer but they account for of all cancer death that massive number of challenge and huge opportunity for impact sarcoma uk recent report find that one in three sarcoma patient wait more than six month to be diagnose referral pathway be frequently misapply and this delay be not minor inconvenience in cancer care it can be fatal the brain tumour charity have call the bill essential for any real hope of progress in find cure the less survivable cancers taskforce have declare that this legislation be crucial for early diagnosis and equity of access the urostomy association in its rare cancer manifesto call for urgent structural change to improve datum screening and outcome and lynch syndrome uk have speak powerfully about the opportunity to accelerate genetic lead ai inform cancer prevention if rare cancer research be properly fund believe that the rare cancers bill will help to achieve that it have three core provision first name lead for rare cancer research so that this agenda have home in government and voice at the top table secondly review of the orphan drug regulation to create well commercial incentive for new treatment and trial and thirdly patient focus datum system build into the be part of research platform so that people be no long leave in the dark about trial that could change their life this be not just about save life it be about improve they it be about ensure that family be not leave with grief and regret when well system might have give they hope today as we consider the rare cancers bill let we remember people like susan michaelis and the countless family who have campaign for change they may not live to see let we recognise that rare cancer be not someone else problem but public health injustice hide in plain sight let we pass the bill not just for the scientist and clinician but for every patient and for every parent and partner who have watch love one suffer from cancer few people can even pronounce this be our chance to correct the imbalance drive innovation and deliver real last change if we seize this moment we can ensure that every patient no matter how rare their cancer can access trial treatment and the possibility of life let we not waste this opportunity let we be clear eyed about the gap and build an nhs that genuinely serve every patient with every type of cancer in every part of this country together let we leave legacy worthy of those we have lose and transform care for those still fight rise to support the bill which will make real difference by improve the detection and treatment of rare cancer we hear really move contribution on second reading particularly from my hon friend the members for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and for calder valley josh fenton glynn with permission from my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur will take this opportunity to press the minister on research into lobular breast cancer echo the comment of the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford twenty two people day be diagnose with lobular breast cancer in the uk at around in it fall outside the scope of the bill however with uk population of million day would popularly be deem to be rare more importantly it have unmet clinical need and that be what really matter lobular breast cancer be first identify as separate type of breast cancer year ago and while breast cancer survival rate have generally improve research specifically into lobular have be rare and grossly underfunde and the basic biology of the disease remain mostly unknown that have lead to two effect first it be difficult to detect as its web like structure mean that it do not have the typical lump so it often spread before it get detect secondly there be no bespoke treatment so doctor will throw the kitchen sink at it radio and chemo and hope for the good scientist say that treatment for lobular can be develop the only reason it have not be lack of funding for research in may dr susan michaelis who have be diagnose with lobular year early launch the lobular moonshot project one of the moonshot campaigner be my constituent katie swinburne mother of three and popular local school teacher meet katie recently in her home along with susan and her husband tristan loraine susan have deteriorate since we have meet on zoom she explain that her cancer be terminal it be too late to save she but she be determined to spend she last year campaign for change we hop that she would have year to come katie however still have hope for treatment and cure in her lifetime she hop to see her child grow old and to carry grandchild this come monday as have be say we be due to meet the secretary of state to press the case for million for the lobular moonshot project which be just for every person diagnose we will still press ahead with that meeting but two day ago dr susan michaelis the founder of the moonshot project sadly pass away year after her initial diagnosis she die peacefully at pm proudly wear her lobular moonshot project shirt she be surround by her husband tristan loraine and some close friend the lobular moonshot project be the most bipartisan politically support campaign in the nation right now with mp from across all party have call on the government to fund this vital research during her year suffer with this cruel and brutal illness susan be give eight different form of breast cancer treatment but none of they be able to stop the disease progress none of the treatment she receive be base on the basic biology of lobular breast cancer because as say it have not yet be explore in the last couple of year susan and team of campaign woman who have be touch by the disease have already raise to set up the infrastructure to carry out research at the manchester breast centre lead by professor robert clarke her remarkable campaign have touch woman across the country if may will share few comment about susan as young girl susan always dream of be pilot but there be few opportunity for woman to become commercial pilot in australia at the time so she complete degree in marketing and save up the money to become private pilot after teach people to fly she finally become an airline pilot start off in the challenging northern territory of australia fly to remote community in when she be susan start fly the british aerospace and immediately notice strange smell in the aircraft the breathing air supply be be contaminate with jet engine oil decomposition product despite be tell that there be nothing to be concern about she suffer increase health effect from those exposure and three year later in she collapse after flight she feel like she be have stroke three year of exposure to complex mix of chemical include organophosphate carbon monoxide and endocrine disrupt chemical have seriously affect her health and she lose her airline pilot medical certificate she never fly as an airline pilot again two year later susan be partly responsible for the australian senate carry out year long investigation into the problem which conclude that the chemical exposure be affect flight safety and crew and public health she be determined that the aviation industry should resolve the problem so she undertake the first ever phd into the subject and later qualified as an air accident investigator she publish numerous scientific paper on the subject and brief airline oil manufacturer government and countless other on the topic in year after her first flight as an airline pilot australian senator reveal secret agreement between british aerospace the aircraft engine manufacturer and two australian airline in which large sum of money and aircraft part be give in settlement for problem relate to oil contaminate the breathing air supply on the aircraft model that susan fly after her injury sustain as an airline pilot susan complete half ironman triathlon and become the first australian to receive the british citizen award for she and tristan work on aviation safety last year the dr susan michaelis rise be launch by harkness roses at the chelsea flower show susan have appear or be portray in numerous documentary and film she will be greatly miss but the campaign that she found will live on once more thank the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for all he have do to bring the bill forward we along with thousand of family throughout the uk all owe he huge debt be proud to have support the bill from the very beginning also pay tribute to the ongoing work of the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh whose inspirational advocacy have set the example on these issue particularly for new mp like do not think need take up much time restate why the rare cancers bill matter every hon member who sit alongside in the bill committee know that already which be why we report it to the house unamende the minister also know which be why the government have repeatedly pledge their support and organisation work with rare cancer know too the brain tumour charity describe this legislation as bill of hope and pancreatic cancer uk talk of its potential to transform survival for rare cancer that potential sit with we today the rare cancers bill take concrete and common sense step to facilitate research into rare cancer to improve the speed and quality of necessary clinical trial and to help get orphan drug medicine often neglect because they target uncommon condition to those patient who so desperately need they urge the house to advance the bill and ensure that its provision become law as rapidly as possible so much depend on get this one right to that end briefly remind the house what exactly be at stake today for family include my own throughout this country when speak on second reading tell the story of group captain pip harding my brother in law who be diagnose with an aggressive stage glioblastoma in february his prognosis be such that he should not be here today pip be marry with five child he have serve in the royal air force in the indo pacific in afghanistan and in iraq be immensely proud of he not least because of his battle against this devastating diagnosis pip family friend and those who love he rally around he more than of they set up gofundme page to cover the cost of an experimental cancer treatment oncothermia which use radio frequency to target and treat malignant cancer cell be happy than can say to be able to tell the house that pip be alive and well and that the tumour have shrink from cm to less than cm as result of that treatment for pip love one of course that mean the world oncothermia be win it for he it mean that there be more time for his family and more time for more treatment to come online to get his health back it be matter of delight that the hon lady brother in law be still well and that the tumour have shrink but should say to the house and all member that that machine which my late sister campaign and raise funding for be currently situate in private hospital in london because it would get nowhere near an nhs hospital that be the tragedy of the circumstance that we find ourselves in our system be so restrictive that we can not look for new innovation within our nhs thank the hon member for all her advocacy on the issue she make an important point which be make previously rare cancer be not rare for the victim and their family that be why we need to bring such treatment into the nhs so that they be available for all not just for those who set up gofundme page that win ten of thousand of pound of glioblastoma pip say this be very sad disease of which the cause be unknown and seem to randomly strike individual it would be just amazing if the policy to support these people be change by this vote and be personally so grateful to all of you who be so kindly drive this forward his successful story and the challenge of access oncothermia underscore equally the importance of the legislation in sum innovative new treatment for rare cancer must be bring to patient as fast as possible my constituent in esher and walton particularly those whose life have be scar by cancer also feel that very deeply in the last few day many have write to about the legislation to share why its success matter so much to they one tell of his very young son who be diagnose last year with rare brain tumour that have turn their life upside down one tell about his own battle with brain cancer the excellent care that he have receive in the nhs and the fundamentally limited treatment option available to he base on the current state of research and drug development and marketing another constituent whose daughter have glioblastoma offer an important reminder about our work today when they say that every important issue or gain have to be fight over fiercely before anything be achieve they be absolutely right will take this opportunity to highlight some other people who have fight and for whom the bill be vital my constituent kate ford have be campaign for the lobular moonshot project since she be diagnose with lobular breast cancer two year we have already hear how research for that disease have be entirely insufficient and how necessary that project be right now be proud to be one of hundred of mps on both side of the house call on the government to support it as we have hear like the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford and for bishop auckland sam rushworth be deeply sadden to hear of the death of dr susan michaelis the project founder this week my constituent kate be now carry forward susan torch and will be at the meeting with the secretary of state for health and social care on monday call on the government to answer susan call and finally back the project while have the government attention will raise one more important issue pip be an raf helicopter pilot there be grow number of veteran who serve as aircrew on military helicopter and be expose to exhaust fume during their time in the force and who have now be diagnose with rare cancer include blood cancer that issue have be raise in recent month by hon member on both side of the house include my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan and the hon member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham understand that the ministry of defence be currently work to test engine exhaust emission and to develop clear understanding of the health challenge face veteran include rare cancer relate to their service those be welcome step but they be insufficient although be conscious that the mod do not unequivocally recognise the link between exhaust fume and such cancer and that be not address the minister for veterans urge the minister to do all he can to accelerate the collation of veteran health datum which be an essential project that could otherwise drag on and to support the development of cancer screening programme for veteran who may be at risk due to their record of serve this country cancer can touch any life it can come unexpectedly and it can come cruelly the bill offer hope to all those whose cancer have be neglect and disregard in drug research and clinical trial but have upend their entire life it offer we the chance to say to all those people you be not alone and you be not forget win the battle against rare cancer require we to advance on many front at once so gently push the minister even as he support the bill become law to consider the vital call from the hon member for mitcham and morden to improve outcome for brain cancer patient which have show too little improvement for too long will the minister commit to target of get glioblastoma patient on to promise new clinical trial every year will he engage with the private sector to urge pharmaceutical company to more rapidly make their drug available for those trial will he consider mandate training in brain cancer specific oncology for all doctor seek to become medical oncologist will he also ensure that all neuro oncology multidisciplinary team have as core member medical oncologist able to contribute their expertise to patient care finally even as we advance the bill today we must not lose sight of the need to do far well by patient with cancer rare or not one of the most reassuring aspect of this bill have be its cross party support but while be here want to ask the minister whether he will listen to liberal democrat call and turn the current target of start treatment within day of an urgent cancer referral into an iron clothe guarantee will he also consider our call to expand the capacity of the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency as another way of ensure that innovative drug be not snarl up in red tape and that they reach patient fast there be much work leave to do but today legislation be real step in the right direction take note of the humbleness of the hon member for edinburgh south west so will speak about the reach of the bill and his work good politic change

of lords when meet my hon friend to berate he about why he should take up this issue do not know about his father in law but have to say how proud his family must be of what he have do here mention that point because it be motivator for all of we when we understand the true desperation of face these problem it can often be the driver to make we work hard for achievement be delighted to say that day ago with the kindness of mr speaker we launch the first glioblastoma drug trial in memory of my late sister it will be run by dr paul mulholland who be regrettably too well know to many member he be europe lead consultant on glioblastoma base out of university college london and the trial will include patient at university college hospital who be newly diagnose they will have have no treatment and no surgery and will be treat with immunotherapy we be excited and delight by the trial it open last friday and dr mulholland meet the first recruit last monday this could be the start of great thing but it be the start of journey it be journey that be incomprehensibly difficult and require wonderful set of circumstance europe lead consultant at big teaching hospital in london next to world lead university group of my sister friend who campaign tirelessly to raise fund raise over million in the last year the trial will cost something in that order and secretary of state for health and social care who give we excellent support and intervene to help we to get to the point of start the trial those effort be not available to everybody we need to change thing to get more trial without trial there will be no progress and know from my own experience that there will be no progress even with this brilliant bill unless we all as member insist on progress and keep an eye on it be so thrilled that so many people on the labour benches and in all party across the house be unite in their commitment to see progress on glioblastoma we want to see hope not only for glioblastoma victim but for the victim of all rare cancer by start with glioblastoma we start with the bad we will not cease our campaign until everybody have fair chance of cure it be great pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and thank she for everything she have do on this issue also thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for take up this bill and get it to this stage as suspect many member do rearrange my diary at short notice to be here because we think there might be risk of the bill not go through but be glad that that do not appear to be transpire be here for three reason one be obviously the merit of this bill which recommend themselves entirely to all side of the house the second be the excellent whipping by my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden think most of the london parliamentary labour party be secrete around the building just in case they should be need thirdly and above all it be because of my experience of what constituent of mine have go through and be sure that go for all member here the email be ping in yesterday say you need to be there tomorrow want to briefly mention two case the first be that of my chiswick constituent rob king will read few word of his because he say what need to be say more eloquently than could during early my wife marie feel extremely tired we think three child busy life week later she have diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and we be face with no treatment option beyond chemotherapy to possibly extend her life by short while we do know timeframe but she have just six month of life remain the chemotherapy be brutal relentless she die aged in october just day off her birthday what she endure nobody should have to endure how she endure this be still beyond my comprehension what this miss be the impact on those around she the parent in their who lose their daughter the sibling leave without sister without an auntie for their child her husband leave deal with thing never plan never envisage in life and most importantly three little child age at the time one and half five and seven have the conversation to say mummy be never come back will haunt forever explain to an infant what be rare cancer and why it can not be fix because there be no treatment the impact of this roll on as they get old rare cancer be not rare they hugely impact

his parent go to extraordinary length to get drug deliver almost on daily basis we be monitor the pharmacy and hospital ensure that he have treatment he do get the treatment and it do prolong his life but sadly alex pass away on january this year age just there be many more case like marie and alex and it be for they that the bill have be bring forward it be not the only thing that need to be do

that that incidence be increase be grateful that the bill allow for some flexibility because if bile duct cancer be to pop over that cut off of one in it would go into different category that flexibility be appreciate guts uk state that the cause of bile duct cancer be unknown in six to seven out of patient it be rare cancer that be increase in prevalence often with cause unknown and nearly people year die from it would it not be well therefore not only to prevent this cancer from increase in prevalence but to make it even rare and more curable the bill open the door to that it will allow for more focus on rare and less survivable cancer research be crucial in tackle cancer and be hearten by this government commitment to tackle all cancer type national cancer plan be due to

we can get the pharmaceutical industry to find it in its financial interest to start trial we will not make any progress thank my hon friend for her intervention agree with everything she say there be no doubt that for patient and their family an additional challenge of rare cancer be navigate the system themselves many of which be not build with rare cancer in mind know from conversation with resident and organisation in huddersfield just how isolate that can be be tell that you have rare form of cancer and struggle to get answer or the standard of treatment that other receive be really difficult this bill will play part in extend the life of people face cancer and it will help their family get target research and clear care pathway will be really important and have no doubt that

that most important of all we will get the government cancer plan let we hope that it will not be on the slow burner we be promise it before the end of the year and hope it will be near this end of

the bill continue support hope that it will pass today as have be outline when it hopefully reach the house of lords it will be in the safe hand of formidable woman have great confidence in she first and foremost thank resident in edinburgh south west for elect and give the chance to bring the bill forward do not know it at the time but without their elect would not be stand here to champion the bill look forward to it receive support today and to continue to champion it as it move to the other place question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass secure to academies bill consideration of bill not amend in the public bill committee clause secure to academies funding impact and consultation beg to move amendment page line leave out subsection with this it will be convenient to discuss amendment to the title line leave out from academy to end some people may be unfamiliar with the detail of the bill because it do not receive second reading debate it go through on the nod on may it then go into quite truncate public bill committee on wednesday july and it have now come back to the chamber on report table amendment to highlight my concern about the consultation arrangement propose in subsection amendment be consequential amendment as people will have notice in the bill long title it state expand secure to academy and to alter the consultation question require when it be propose to establish or expand secure to academy if amendment be successful the long title would need to be amend and in anticipation of that table amendment as ever be most grateful to the public bill office for have ensure that be on the right line with that and that such an amendment could be table amendment arise from the fact that section of the academies act state that before enter into an academy arrangement the provider must carry out consultation on the question of whether the arrangement should be enter into clause would insert into that provision an exception that where the educational institution if the arrangement be enter into be to be secure to academy the person be not require to carry out consultation on that question in other word it be an exemption from the requirement for consultation on the question of whether the arrangement should be enter into do not see that as reasonable thing to do in the short debate on this matter in the bill committee there be bit of misrepresentation when it be state that secure school do not compete with other school official report secure to academies public bill committee july that may be true but they can compete with other institution particularly those provide alternative provision clause add to section of the act that for secure to academy the person be not require to carry out consultation on that question but must instead carry out consultation on the question of how they should cooperate with potential local partner in connection with the establishment and carry on of the academy those local partner be describe as potential local partner mean person exercise function of public nature think the bill have in mind organisation such as the health service the local education authority councillor and so on and so far as not fall within paragraph proprietor of educational institution with whom the person carry out the consultation think it appropriate to cooperate again that discretion be leave with the person carry out the consultation do not understand why we be abandon the much more fundamental issue of the consultation there might be no competition between secure to academy and an ordinary school but there may well be competition between that secure academy and another such academy that be already in existence or that may be propose the legislation on secure academy be introduce in the previous parliament at the time nobody think there be any problem with have the same arrangement for secure to academy as for other academy this short debate on amendment will give the minister an opportunity to explain why that change be necessary how it be justify and why there need to be deletion of the exist consultation arrangement rather than an addition to the exist arrangement of be subject to consultation which be the subject of propose new subsection to section of the academies act as in subsection while it be quite short point think it be important what be previously think to be useful in term of consultation be now regard as be of secondary importance it seem to that propose to establish or expand secure to academy be big decision big step and that it should be the subject of the consultation as originally set out in the academies act the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope focus on the specific question of why this change should be make it be very much technical change we have one secure school the oasis academy in kent which have visit these secure school be for young people who be sentence to custody they join the rest of the youth custodial estate which include three young offender institution and secure training centre as well as yoi in wales and some secure child home it be very discrete landscape there be no competition with alternative provision or any other provision locally because it would be inappropriate for young person who be sentence to custody to go into alternative provision as they have to go to secure provision that is young offender institution or one of the other secure provision one of which be the secure school it be bit of an oversight in the original legislation to use the term consultation about whether it should go ahead because there be no competition in the locality more useful consultation would be about how because there be issue about work with other partner include partner that might provide alternative provision and that be the most appropriate way of do that welcome the fact that my hon friend the member for cramlington and killingworth emma foody have bring this bill before we today it seek to make more sense of the legislation so that it will be more effective for these particular young people and these particular place be so grateful to the minister what breath of fresh air that minister have actually answer my challenge and give an explanation in the light of those circumstance beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment amendment by leave withdraw third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time be grateful to hon member for their contribution and to the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope for table the amendment in the interest of time commend the bill to the house now have the chance to talk about the bill do not have chance on second reading because the bill go through on the nod and be not on the bill committee be the loser as result be not invite the hon member for cramlington and killingworth emma foody steer it through committee quickly and now it have come back to the house and she do not feel the need to expand on it in any way will take up one particular challenge because my hon friend the member for spelthorne lincoln jopp ask question in committee and the minister say thank the hon member who have contribute so far on the issue just raise by the hon member for spelthorne they be for the bill as it make progress assume that it do progress however be happy to write to he with an answer to those point as they be pertinent official report secure to academies public bill committee july do not know whether such letter have be send but if so have not see the content as be not committee member when the minister respond in his usual helpful way hope that he will share his answer to my hon friend question that be relatively detailed point my great concern about the bill come from be great supporter of academy and what they have do to transform education provision in our country by remove that provision from the dead hand of so many local authority speak as someone who early in my political career succeed in persuade margaret thatcher to abolish the inner london education authority which be one of the great success story of my campaigning the police crime sentencing and courts act deal with this issue and set out the secure academy can not understand whether it be an oversight that the legislation be not change then to ensure that there be guarantee of only two year funding under the academies act an academy be guarantee seven year of funding after be set up and if that be curtail there would essentially be compensation for the academy more importantly set up an academy be an expensive job as know from the setting up of what become parkfield school as an academy in my constituency it transfer from free school that start in bournemouth and do not have premise it be basically on the third floor of an office block it could not get planning permission because of hostility from the local education authority which do not relish the prospect of competition it then find some premise in my constituency that already have an educational use because they be the training school for nats the national air traffic service in christchurch the cost of convert those facility into premise suitable for an academy be significant it be time consume and critic of the academy system use the fact that so much money be be spend on this provision against the then government it be time consume and critic of the academy system use the fact that so much money be be spend on this provision against the then government however it be make more secure by the fact that there be guarantee that the academy could stay in place for seven year be sorry to say that at the end of this term the academy know as parkfield school will no long exist because the academy trust that take over the running of it have decide to pull out the original notice be give year ago and last year the school deal solely with people who be wait to complete their gcse the building there will now revert to the department for education what will happen to they who know the investment be there maybe it will be use by the local authority for alternative education provision maybe it will be use as secure to academy the point be that an academy would never have be able to get start in the premise at parkfield school have it be give only two year lease of life member of this house who be elect one year ago this month think that five year duration be pretty short they can not really get their foot under the table and invest to be fit for the future if they have guarantee existence of only up to five year if we be talk about premise take on staff and everything that go with that even more so if we be talk about secure premise can not understand why the minimum notice period under funding arrangement will be reduce from seven year to two the argument put forward be that two year termination period will enable the government to prioritise value for money for the taxpayer and have more flexibility should there be need to terminate funding agreement with secure school provider that have not be expand upon in any of the debate that have hear or in the explanatory note it be just statement and mere repetition of it can not be substitute for justification of it how will lower the termination period to two year prioritise value for money it may well mean that short termism prevail because the academy say that it can not do this or that and invest for the future because it have only two year potential lifespan in articulate the government case the hon member for cramlington and killingworth go on to say in committee reduce it to two year strike balance between avoid lengthy exit period in which government would be commit to continue fund the secure school long than necessary this be exactly the system for academy if an academy fail there have to be an exit period as have happen in parkfield school while ensure that secure school provider have the certainty of funding to avoid issue with recruit and retain the specialist staff require to work in this environment official report secure to academies public bill committee july would suggest that have only two year contract be hardly encouraging for potential member of staff do not think the number of people aspire to be member of parliament would increase if the knowledge be that there would be an election every two year and they might find themselves retrospectively on two year contract the hon member for cramlington and killingworth then go on to justify the disapplication of section of the academies act in this bill that be not the subject of an amendment from but she say that it would remove the requirement that the secretary of state consider the impact of enter into new academy funding agreement on other educational establishment in the area for secure to academy although it be important that secure school be establish as academy in order to ensure they mirror good practice in the community they be fundamentally different as secure school do not compete with other school they do not compete with other school but they could potentially compete with other organisation the hon lady then say as such we do not expect they to have an impact on the viability of other local mainstream school that be fine do not expect that but what about school that be not mainstream that be use as an argument to say that this bill would disapply that duty for this particular type of school to help any future secure school open with minimal delay official report secure to academies public bill committee july come to this bill in slightly suspicious state of mind because we know that the government be not really enthusiastic about academy the minister will correct if be wrong but if the academy programme will not call it an experiment because it have succeed have be in position to have be bring forward under labour government do not think they would ever have do it this labour government be reluctant and realise that they can not really abolish academy but be concerned that what be propose in this bill may be the starting point of facilitate the making of academy less financially viable and their wither on the vine by remove that all important seven year guarantee of funding or indefinite funding with seven year notice which have to be give under the legislation those be my concern the fact that this bill seem to have consensus across the house make even more concerned when we look at lawmaking in this house we see that many of the bad law be those that be introduce with cross party consensus the hon member for cramlington and killingworth refer to the issue of time there be no constraint on we be able to debate this bill today which be what we be do this be the last sitting friday that have be allocate by the government but be assure by the government whip who deal with these thing that this session of parliament be likely to continue well beyond the autumn and that there will doubtless be far sit fridays if there be far sit friday and some of the business on the order paper today be not reach we will be able to reach it on the next sitting friday choose as you will know madam deputy speaker although there be limit of day for private member legislation where session of parliament have be extend significantly there have by convention be an addition of sit fridays to compensate for that in the same way that additional time be provide for opposition day by convention otherwise strictly speak under the standing orders there would not be sufficient opposition day be not suggest we go on debate this bill into the next friday but hope that when the minister respond he do not feel that he be inhibit by time constraint impose by the whips because those time constraint be artificial in the extreme and can be alter look forward to have my concern address be open to be reassure and look forward to the minister pursue such course call the shadow minister rise to express the opposition support for the bill thank the hon member for cramlington and killingworth emma foody for bring it forward note that my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope be not so keen for to make the most of the time available so do not intend to as be note during the early stage of the bill this legislation largely mirror previous bill introduce before the election by my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson my office neighbour as it happen although the previous bill do not complete its passage pay tribute to her dedication and clear commitment to improve outcome for child in custody she lay the ground work for the bill we be debate today and have no doubt that she will be pleased to see it return to the house with the support of the hon member for cramlington and killingworth secure to academy also know as secure school be new form of custodial provision with education and rehabilitation at their core they represent much need shift in how we support and care for young people in custody the last conservative government introduce the first secure school oasis restore in medway the evidence show that small unit that focus on education health and the root cause of offending be the most likely to reduce reoffende by help these child and they be child to turn their life around we can make sure that everyone be safe in the long run secure school be not typical educational institution and it be both appropriate and necessary that different legal and procedural requirement apply to they the bill make number of change to funding and consultation requirement which be all eminently sensible although we agree with the bill provision we would welcome reassurance from the government that the school will be properly fund and support and that appropriate step be be put in place to ensure that young people in custody be properly support to reduce their reoffending if secure school be to succeed where other part of the youth estate have historically struggle they must be properly resource effectively lead and root in strong local partnership we would be interested to hear more in due course about the government long term vision for the youth estate what further plan do they have if any to open any new secure school what future role do they see young offender institution and secure training centre play how will the government ensure that partnership with health and education provider be strengthen to maximise the impact of this reform would be grateful if the minister could make some remark along those line this be practical and proportionate bill the opposition support it and look forward to see its progress be very grateful to my hon friend the member for cramlington and killingworth emma foody for the excellent work she have do in bring forward this important bill and navigate we to this point be also grateful to the shadow minister for his support and for his comment assure he that we will take forward the issue he rightly raise in due course in answer to the welcome scepticism from the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope can confirm that write to the hon member for spelthorne lincoln jopp and indeed copy in the rest of the committee point out that oasis restore have agree to the rationale for reduce the notice period from seven year to two and for this change to be apply to their funding agreement as result there will be no financial impact on the taxpayer pick up exactly the point that the hon member for christchurch rightly raise it have be deal with academy be first introduce by the government of sir tony blair but the issue raise by the hon member for christchurch about academy generally be matter for the department for education rather than commend the bill to the house and thank my hon friend the member for cramlington and killingworth for bring it forward with the leave of the house thank you madam deputy speaker and member across the house thank the clerks the minister and the shadow minister for their support and the contribution and welcome challenge from the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope it be brilliant to see such consensus on this important issue also want to say quick thank you to my team for the work they have do to support in bring this bill forward in my first year in the house along with official from the ministry of justice without their support would not have be able to do so look forward to hopefully the continued support of hon member for the bill as it progress through further stage question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass court remote hearings bill consideration of bill not amend in the public bill committee clause amendment to legislation about court hearing beg to move amendment page line leave out subsection this amendment would exclude an amendment to paragraph of schedule to the local government finance act it would reduce the bill from cover four area to cover only section of the family law act section of the anti social behaviour crime and policing act and section of the policing and crime act why be concerned about remove provision relate to local government well have be instrumental in discuss in the house and elsewhere the cost and burden of council tax ever since it be introduce consequent upon the failure of the legislation for community charge be privileged to help take through this house that legislation on the community charge in the late still meet people who think it be big mistake to abandon the community charge which would have ensure that everybody in receipt of local government service if they be over would have make contribution that be all history it be change we introduce council tax and with it council tax administration and enforcement regulation it be those regulation that would now be alter by clause of the bill instead of what be already set out on the ability of the court to deal with council tax administrative and enforcement problem it be suggest that those court hearing should be able to be hold remotely in other word there would not be any proper ability for people to see what be go on in my view the deterrent value of such hearing would be lose because they would be remote hearing rather than in person hearing in the local magistrate court let also mention the extent of the problem we already have with the enforcement of council tax arrear they be now in the order of billion as the minister will know some billion in council tax arrear think almost of that total be attributable to just four local authority it will not surprise hon member to know that those local authority be liverpool birmingham manchester and brent between they those four local authority be responsible for more than of the billion in council tax arrear at the moment what be we do why be we try to reduce the pressure on council tax payment miscreant by enable they to hide behind remote hearing instead of have to face the music in proper court of law where justice can not only be do but be see to be do why should council tax debtor not be require to attend court hearing in person the court can then make inquiry about the person and discuss mean of payment it can all be do with witness the magistrate can see aspect of the demeanour of the defendant in person and take those into account most importantly of all they can ensure that the court process act as deterrent against people think that pay their council tax be essentially voluntary activity real debt crisis be build in this country and not just on council tax serve on the energy security and net zero committee we have hear evidence that the arrear on energy payment be now billion or more why be we seek in this bill to reduce the pressure on people who almost make pay council tax seem voluntary why do we not put more pressure on the local authority responsible for lot of the council tax arrear be lucky enough to live in the new forest district council area it be in the council tax arrear league table that amount to about per council tax payer by contrast in liverpool the arrear be which mean that for every council tax dwelling be owe what be be do to put pressure on liverpool city council to do something about the situation the same apply to other council include in the area that be privileged to represent bcp council be in the league table with more than million of council arrear amount to per council tax dwelling dorset council in the other half of my constituency have million in council tax arrear amount to per council tax dwelling have table the amendment to ask the minister this why we be propose to facilitate remote hearing for issue relate to council tax the council tax administration and enforcement regulation enable council to issue reminder notice and final notice if the debt remain unpaid for more than day after reminder notice be send the council can apply to the magistrate court for liability order there will then be hearing and if the magistrate find that the taxpayer have fail to pay council tax they will order the taxpayer to pay the outstanding sum as well as the council cost that be set out in regulation once liability order be grant the council can use several different enforcement method to collect the debt it can instruct an employer to deduct money under an attachment of earning order it can make deduction from benefit it can take control of good or it can issue charge order in extremis the council can even initiate bankruptcy proceeding and ultimately it can apply to commit the taxpayer to prison if bailiff have be unable to find good belong to the taxpayer that cover the debt give that local authority possess all those power under the council tax administration and enforcement regulation why be they not be use effectively why do we think that create remote hearing be go to improve matter that seem absolutely ludicrous to if ever there be good use of magistrate court time it be to ensure that conscientious payer of council tax in the area cover by that court do not have to subsidise people who do not pay their council tax result in the enormous arrear to which have refer that be why be concerned about this proposal remote hearing be introduce during the pandemic and have be use in other circumstance but the consequence of remote hearing be that the press and the public be in the dark one of the good deterrent to council tax non payment would be for people who be in receipt of liability order in the local magistrate court to have their name and address publish in the local paper that be go to be make much more difficult if the bill contain reference to council tax when it become law so on behalf of all those people who be suffer as result of the more than billion owe in council tax urge the government not to proceed with this particular part of the bill that be why have table my amendment the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope raise important concern but this bill be not about reduce the pressure on miscreant it be about deal with they as effectively and efficiently as possible the bill do not mandate the use of video it allow the court flexibility instead of the police be use as taxi driver move people around when they should be deal with other miscreant case will be able to be deal with in much more effective way when magistrate or judge need to be find at short notice can assure the hon gentleman that this measure will benefit justice and will assist in deal with the miscreant that he and be both concerned about the current situation make it more difficult to do that thank the minister for his response perhaps the logic of what he say be that instead of my amendment to remove the provision relate to council tax we should add to the bill provision about shoplifter and fraudster so that they be subject to remote hearing on the basis that this will assist in the administration of justice be too slow to table amendment to such an effect in order to draw out the minister far but it be implicit in what have say that do not accept the explanation he have give be that explanation to be correct urge he to add category to the bill when it reach the lords so that justice can be do as he would see it beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment amendment by leave withdraw third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time we cover the bill extensively in committee and there be fairly wholesome debate about amendment on report this be sensible and proportionate bill it be slim and sophisticated and ask the house to approve its third reading madam deputy speaker it will not surprise you that in the light of the minister response to my amendment be very unhappy about the bill unamended it incorporate the provision on local government non payer that describe on report can not get my head round the argument put forward by the minister and it be replicate in the explanatory note on the bill which say this bill create more efficient process for handle these matter remove the need to move people from police cell to court and for judge magistrate to travel to attend court in person to hear the case at the weekend or public holiday that certainly do not refer to case involve local government debt it may well apply to some case relate to other aspect of the bill the explanatory note also say the use of remote link in criminal proceeding be relatively common and have deliver significant benefit it be also common in civil and family proceeding in those proceeding the appearance of defendant by remote link be permit at the direction of the court include case of far great sensitivity or gravity of course family proceeding be in camera anyway so joe public of the local daily echo will not get access to that be not suggest that they should but if they can not access information about who be in council tax arrear and be be bring before the court that will become much more difficult the explanatory note go on to say the lack of legal power to order that these case be hear by remote link mean that all arrest defendant must be transport from the police station to court early go through all the stage that people have to go through before they find themselves threaten with imprisonment for debt if they go through all those stage surely it be important that they should be bring to court and we should not be concern about the fact that they will have to be transport from the police station to court or that the judge may have to travel to court of course all that have be make more difficult because we have close so many magistrate court that the travel distance be long indicate assent see that the minister agree we have so few court now compare with before that people have to travel far with all the inconvenience that that lead to the explanatory note continue this lead to delay in deal with the case and be not an effective way of use resource just do not think that that apply in the case of the council tax provision if there be sunset clause and we could see whether put more pressure on council to take action against those who do not pay council tax reduce overall arrear then we might be get somewhere thank the hon gentleman for his consider contribution to the debate will be brief he be make some reasonable point but he be answer his own question we currently have bottleneck in the court system and by be against the measure in the bill he be probably inadvertently make it easy for these people not to be see by the court system the bill be reasonable and small as have say if we can release some pressure in that bottleneck the point he make about council tax debtor and other be quite right more debt will be recover and more miscreant will be see in the criminal justice system and that be always good thing he be make reasonable point but he be answer his own question through the explanatory note be grateful to the hon gentleman for make that point but be not sure that agree in essence the criminal justice system be there to ensure that there be level playing field that everybody be equal under the law and that the rule of law apply the figure that have give show that the rule of law be not be consistently apply across the country when it come to the duty to pay council tax and quite lot of enforcement authority seem to be rather cavalier about enforcement just do not think that allow remote hearing will suddenly rectify situation in which council tax arrear in birmingham and three other authority amount to well over billion indeed some of the area where council tax arrear be high be the area where we have see complete failure of administration birmingham city council be one such example as direct result of birmingham city council failure to operate effectively the government have to intervene put the council into special measure and essentially allow the council to increase council taxis far in excess of the threshold that normally apply the same be true in croydon and thurrock if the hon member for burnley oliver ryan look at my list of local authority and council tax arrear he will see that failure to deal with council tax arrear be very good indicator of local authority failure although have yet to do the work on link that proposition with the salary that the chief executive of those local authority pay themselves do not believe that those large inflexible authority will be motivate by the bill to have remote hearing when they be not even prepared to use the exist structure it may well be this point support the hon gentleman that small council like new forest district council be quick on those who do not pay their council tax or do not pay it promptly the possibility of have remote hearing instead of those council have to issue court summons might save administrative cost and save the burden however in my submission that potential small benefit be more than outweigh by the problem have be describe it would have be so easy for the government to put forward this bill on the basis that it would not apply to council tax have say that section of the family law act require that person in breach of an occupation order where that order contain power of arrest must be bring before court within hour of the arrest that be why the argument be make that court have to be available over the weekend and so on as be so often the case when we be face with legislation like this it would perhaps be sensible to change that provision so that the person do not need to be bring before court within hour of arrest if that period include saturday or sunday that would be much more direct way of deal with this issue in my submission again it be an easy cop out for the government to say that because the person have to be bring before court within hour we have to go for remote hearing if we do away with the need to bring the person in within hour if it be the weekend we would not need this bill section of the family law act state that the court can remand person in breach of non molestation order who have be bring before court pursuant to warrant for arrest and the matter be not dispose of forthwith that be another example of where this situation apply section of the anti social behaviour crime and policing act require that person arrest follow breach of an antisocial behaviour injunction where that injunction contain power of arrest must be bring before court within hour of arrest why be we not amend section of that act to ensure that in the circumstance that the arrest take place over weekend the hour timeframe do not apply similarly section of the policing and crime act require that person arrest follow breach of gang relate violence or drug deal injunction must be bring before court within hour of arrest again that could easily be amend to avoid the need for these remote hearing which be what we be concentrate on in this bill be lawyer by background as you know madam deputy speaker when be at university do my law degree or my jurisprudence degree to be precise can remember our law class go to the local assize when rape trial be take place as one might imagine there be lot of interest from these embryo lawyer in what be happen in that rape trial remember it to this day the defend counsel get up and ask essentially that the house do sit in private the high court judge put his foot up on the bench in front of he and say really he be speak to the law student who he know be in the gallery that justice must not only be do but must be see to be do that be message that learn very early on as law student and still think it apply remote hearing could be justify during the covid crisis fine but now they be be use as an excuse we already have some example of where they be permit but the bill go too far in extend that the hon member for burnley who introduce the bill may feel it be rather sad that it be be pick at by member of the house not member just one well do not know be sure that speak for many the hon gentleman have make some reasonable point throughout the debate when do my graduate diploma in law we do similar exercise and go to court to see big trial but that be not what the bill would cover it be for small mass case that as have be mention deal with thing like council tax arrear as the hon gentleman be aware we be short on time so will quietly throw myself on his mercy and ask he whether we can get to the end of this before half past the bill would be of great benefit to the legal system he will know from his day as lawyer in the system that some modernisation be require it be not always good thing but believe that this be measured approach if we can please get through to the end of the debate by half past we can make some progress the hon gentleman have disarm smile and approach dare say it be almost seductive may put to he an alternative proposition he be in position to influence the government whip to ensure that extra sit fridays be provide because his bill be on its third reading assume that its third reading be not complete today it would take priority over other bills when additional sit friday be put on the fact be that we have not yet even have an announcement about the sit day for next year year ago after the general election the leader of the house give we the sit day for the whole period through to the end of this july and congratulate she on that at the time she have not do that in relation to next year but understand it be likely that this first session will go on perhaps even beyond christmas in the meantime we could have another sit friday where the hon gentleman bill could be deal with on third reading the question now arise as to whether should reflect on the point that the hon gentleman make in his intervention or just rely on the minister and my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle dr mullan on the opposition front bench to put in their three pennyworth recognise that unfortunately we be always time limited and regret that so many of the report stage fridays be take up with one bill we be deal with the consequence of that today we be now debate the fourth bill of the day on report which if one look at the record be pretty good strike rate for report stage friday we be now in the middle of debate this important bill which would affect lot of people do not see any reason at all why this important debate should not be able to continue on the next sitting friday one have very little power in this place as back bencher but one thing one do have be power over the time we want to come on to another important bill about control drug be sure the power that be will know that if we be to get on and discuss the hon member for burnley bill and the controlled drugs procedure for specification bill we will need an additional sitting friday at the same time we would then be able to deal with the bill on homelessness by the chairman of the committee my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman which go through unopposed at second reading but have be block by the government ever since that be intolerable the debate stand adjourn standing order no order that the

valley regional park protection motion make and question propose that this house do now mather it be an honour to be here on one of the warm fridays of the year to enjoy and extend our time in the house for the final adjournment debate of the week be delighted to discuss the colne valley regional park which straddle london slough buckinghamshire windsor and maidenhead so many different constituency its importance for infrastructure and as strategic geographical location be second to none which be why secure this debate the beautiful south bucks village of denham fulmer richings park iver heath and the ivers be all part of the colne valley regional park its national significance be mainly due to its geographical location it be in proximity to heathrow high speed go right through it and we have all the motorway it provide the lung of london and the vital break of green belt between london and the county outside it we get zero benefit from the ultra low emission zone the mayor restriction on how we can go in and out of london or from transport for london all we have be bit of green space that give we buffer between london and buckinghamshire that be true for all the county that straddle london along west london and the our issue be that that little bit of green belt some of which madam deputy speaker be as small divide as the area between the two side of the house which be our last remain bit of green belt and which separate we from london be under attack it be under attack from overdevelopment the expansion of heathrow and motorway expansion the proposal for third runway at heathrow would take acre of the regional park directly not to mention the indirect consequence include colnbrook and horton in my constituency which would be irreparable do my hon friend condemn the chancellor press the panic button and inflict this irreversible damage on the colne valley park thank my hon friend who have long be champion of the colne valley regional park and the green belt in that area it will impact we in such negative way have fight to stop the third runway at heathrow and to champion and protect our green belt the problem be we have very little green belt there and the expansion would increase the impact on that green belt both with car come into heathrow and plane take off the amount of green belt that would be consume would be devastating to my area as be sure it would be to my hon friend this be time for the government to do something incredible they can preserve the green space of the colne valley regional park which provide the vital lung for london while allow their infrastructure to flourish around it it be important that this green belt land be preserve that be what must happen now there be no protection of this because it be an area whose ownership have pass between london buckinghamshire and slough over the year there be part of it that have be own by london council and then by buckinghamshire council and vice versa it have be go on for quite some time right now there be no additional protection it be not common land or an area of outstanding natural beauty it be simply land that be green and that provide vital green corridor for wildlife and farmer and for wildlife conservation across the west london and buckinghamshire area all that be under threat from overdevelopment today want to focus on the wonderful landscape and countryside diversity that be at risk in the word of the colne valley regional park itself our countryside be in crisis the team at the park have set out call for action and in this debate want to set out my unwavering support for that call be grateful for all the community support for the colne valley regional park have see across denham iver iver heath richings park and all the south bucks village give its proximity to london it be one of the most pressurised green belt area it be the very epitome of the lung of london but it also epitomise why we must take action now an avalanche of development be be propose across the park which would divide it and cause the closing of the wildlife corridor they would cause detrimental impact for wildlife and for those who use and access the park all that be happen while the park sit between two of europe big infrastructure project and the expansion of heathrow all that development be happen while the colne valley regional park lack any of the protection of an aonb this be cross party issue because the park cross into london buckinghamshire windsor and slough and into labour lib dem and conservative constituency it touch many political party because it impact so many constituency across the west london area the hon member for slough mr dhesi could not be here but he want to show his support for the colne valley regional park as do my hon friend the member for windsor jack rankin who be rightly in his place to support it today and my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds who have long be champion for this area many other mps would have like to be here today they tell to pass on to the minister that this issue matter across the party it be not political issue but it be an issue that many member from across this house care about deeply without plan the development will happen around the park and vital green corridor will be lose forever the colne valley regional park have set out five point plan to influence local planning restore the landscape reform national planning establish its status and protect nature will focus on two area that explicitly matter to this house and the government and will touch briefly on funding since arrive in parliament have be advocate for strong protection for the colne valley regional park there be real and urgent need to look at extend the chilterns aonb to include the park if there be not an extension of the chilterns aonb specific designation for the park itself need to be progress will the minister work with to explore that opportunity urgently the colne valley regional park also represent an opportunity to show how we can plan for green space around the edge of city any big infrastructure project will require the input of green space please will the minister make sure that the green space that be require for any such infrastructure expansion be put into the colne valley regional park so that we can work in tandem to provide what the resident and wildlife need while the government be still able to put in their infrastructure project where they choose at the moment our approach to national planning do not address the strategic risk opportunity and problem that face the colne valley regional park we have unique opportunity to address that the colne valley regional park span many local authority yet be of national importance for the reason set out we have to think beyond boundary and integrate area such as the park which lack national park status or aonb protection into our national strategic planning will the minister explore use the colne valley regional park as case study and test case to explore just how we might do that we have an opportunity to plan strategically for our countryside in our national planning policy for major development around the colne valley regional park and area like it the park should be an integral part of the planning process not treat as something for side consideration we can plan how green corridor for people and wildlife can sit alongside the major development of infrastructure and housing that be plan around the london area will the minister consider how the national planning framework can be develop urgently for just that purpose finally will touch briefly on funding the colne valley regional park rely on local authority grant and the generosity of corporate donor to fund its operational cost hope that have set out clearly how effectively those resource be use for the good of our landscape biodiversity and community but give the strategic development challenge that the park face to its very existence it need fund support to enable plan and to develop response will the minister consider way in which body such as the colne valley regional park can be well support financially in the context of dramatically change planning landscape will the minister speak to the mayor of london to see whether some of the ulez contribution be make by driver could be use for the park upkeep and protection the park be very much impact by infrastructure project that be happen in london but receive no funding from london so will the minister speak to the mayor about some of those resource be reallocate to the park there be many more point that time have not allow to cover so will the minister agree to meet the hon member for slough my hon friend the member for windsor and other from across the house to discuss the issue of colne valley regional park in depth the colne valley regional park matter to and my constituent it have importance nationally for our wildlife and as case study for how green space can exist alongside our major city it mean something that matter to we all it be time now to listen and act before it be too late congratulate the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey on secure this important debate she and disagree on many aspect of politic and policy but no one can doubt the strength with which she speak on behalf of those she represent the government recognise the vital role that the colne valley regional park play in provide access to countryside and green space for the million of people who live in close proximity to it we appreciate fully that it be highly value by local community we also recognise its importance for biodiversity as the hon lady know the park contain part of one special protection area part of one national nature reserve site of special scientific interest and seven local nature reserve assure the hon lady that share her desire to ensure that the colne valley regional park be protect for current and future generation to enjoy and hope that can reassure she today that the government commitment to deliver the housing and infrastructure growth that our country so desperately need be not at odd with safeguard the park for future generation it might be useful for to set out the protection already afford by exist national planning policy as set out in paragraph of the national planning policy framework the purpose of the planning system be to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development include the provision of home commercial development and support infrastructure in sustainable manner the framework make clear that sustainable development should be pursue through both the preparation and implementation of local development plan and the application of policy in the framework achieve sustainable development mean that the planning system have three overarch objective economic social and environmental to support its environmental objective the nppf set out that planning policy and decision should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by protect and enhance value landscape and site of biodiversity or geological value in manner commensurate with their statutory status as the hon lady have make clear the colne valley regional park do not have such status at present or their identify quality in the relevant development plan to support its social objective the nppf set out strong safeguard to prevent the loss of open space make clear that such space should not be build on unless there be clear evidence that it be no long require unless equivalent or well provision be secure in suitable location or unless development of the site be for alternative sport and recreational provision the benefit of which clearly outweigh the loss of the current or former use turn now to green belt policy an issue on which the hon lady have strong view which she have express forcefully in the past the government be commit to preserve green belt which have serve england town and city well over many decade not least in check the unrestricted sprawl of large build up area and in prevent neighbouring town from merge into one another as the hon lady mention the colne valley regional park occupy the inner green belt on the western edge of london be well aware of how important the designation be to its integrity and future it be important to note that this government have not change the five purpose of the green belt set out in paragraph of the nppf and we do not propose to alter its general extent nor be green belt policy alter in any way by provision in the planning and infrastructure bill which be currently in the other place we do however act quickly to replace the piecemeal and haphazard approach take by the previous government to green belt designation and release with more strategic and targeted approach emphasise that minister do not determine what if any green belt land be release in any give local planning authority area it be for local planning authority themselves to determine whether exceptional circumstance justify do so and we expect they first to demonstrate that they have fully examine all other reasonable option for meeting identify need for development include make as much use as possible of suitable brownfield site and underutilise land optimise the density of development and work with neighbouring authority to assess whether identify need might be sensibly accommodate elsewhere national planning policy and our recently publish guidance on green belt assessment be clear that release of or development on green belt land should not fundamentally undermine the ability of the remain green belt across the area of the plan from serve all five of the green belt purpose national policy make it clear that where it be necessary to release green belt land for development local development plan must take sequential approach first prioritise previously develop land and then low quality grey belt land that have not be previously develop before consider other green belt location under our revised approach the sustainability of green belt site must be prioritise and local planning authority must pay particular attention to transport connection when consider whether grey belt be sustainably locate it be because we recognise the value that the public place on the green belt that we have take step to ensure that any necessary development on land release from it must deliver high level of affordable housing the provision of new green space or improvement to exist green space that be accessible to the public and the making of necessary improvement to local or national infrastructure our new golden rule which be the mechanism by which we will deliver that public gain will apply where major housing development be propose on green belt land release through plan make or subject to planning application although the hon member for beaconsfield do not mention it want to touch briefly on the planning and infrastructure bill which be pertinent to the environmental issue that she raise when it come to development and the environment we know that we can do well than the status quo which too often see both sustainable house building and nature recovery stall as she will know part of the bill will introduce new nature restoration fund which will unlock and accelerate development while go beyond neutrality to unlock the positive impact that development can have in drive nature recovery environmental delivery plan as propose in part of the bill will address any potential negative effect of development on protect site and specie whether locate in national park national landscape or elsewhere edp can be put in place only where the secretary of state be satisfied that the delivery of conservation measure be likely to outweigh the negative effect of development where that be not the case exist environmental obligation include those arise under the conservation of habitats and species regulations will remain in place in addition edp and the conservation measure they propose must be evidence base and properly scrutinise before be put into place edp may include back up measure that can be deploy if monitoring show that the environmental outcome be not be deliver policy safeguard relate to the protection of national park and national landscape include those set out in the national planning policy framework and relevant national policy statement remain in place have listen the hon lady contribution think that the bulk of her concern stem from the fact that colne valley regional park do not have any statutory status that be not something on which can give she commitment from the dispatch box today she will know that in other case such as the lee valley park specific act of parliament bring forward statutory status however be more than willing to sit down with she and other hon member take the point that there be cross party value attribute to the park to discuss far how we can ensure that it be protect for current and future generation to enjoy although have note the concern that the hon lady have raise will reflect on they and look forward to that meeting be clear that appropriate protection be in place to safeguard the country park and green space and that the planning and infrastructure bill will unlock win win for the economy and nature house adjourn
