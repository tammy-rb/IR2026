clearly what the government have say only last week the prime minister say at the dispatch box that he would give the security force the power that they report october vol if he be to fulfil that promise urge he to get up to speed on this issue and implement the scheme furthermore parliament intelligence and security committee have warn that british university be increasingly rich feeding ground for china to exert political influence over we that be why we pass the higher education freedom of speech act with new power to help to defend university from that threat but the new education secretary have since block it can the prime minister tell we how without that tool the government will prevent chinese influence over our university really do not think that party political point on

recognise the remarkable contribution that the uk million unpaid carer make to society and the huge financial challenge many face note with deep concern that ten of thousand of carer be unfairly punish for overpayment of carer allowance due to the week earning limit believe that carer should not be force to face the stress humiliation and fear cause by demand for repayment of carer allowance condemn the previous government for fail to address this scandal call on the government to write off exist overpayment immediately raise the carer allowance earning limit and introduce taper to end the unfair cliff edge and far call on the government to conduct comprehensive review of support for carer to help people juggle care and work it be great honour to open the first full liberal democrat opposition day in year assure the house that we will not waste our precious debate on the sort of political game playing to which opposition day often fall victim instead we will use they to focus on the thing that really matter to ordinary people and to tell ministers directly about the real problem that our constituent face that bring to our first motion on unpaid carer or family carer as prefer to say they be people look after relative friend or neighbour and they do remarkable and important job look after someone they love can be rewarding and full of love whether they be parent of disabled child teenager look after terminally ill parent or close relative of an elderly family member but it be far from glamorous care for family member can be relentless and exhausting as the house know have be carer for much of my life but more importantly have also have the great privilege of meeting and hearing from thousand of carer in my constituency and across the united kingdom have some understanding of the challenge that carer face every single day the worry the exhaustion the lack of break and the financial difficulty too britain carer deserve our support hope that the right hon gentleman will take this as friendly intervention as he know what be go to say he talk about family carer and mention teenager who support love one which be important but do he agree that we should recognise the role of young carer have work with they know that they can be as young as five year old and support love one or family member the hon member be absolutely right include young carer indeed be member of the all party parliamentary group on young carer and young adult carer and invite he to join we it be chair by well establish labour member young carer be very much part of our thinking but for some who will not be young order may say to the hon member for reading west and mid berkshire olivia bailey please do not walk in front of member when they be intervene please can we think of other for carer who can receive carer allowance which do not include young carer it be lifeline carer allowance be the main financial support available but frankly as the main way that we support family carer it be not fit for purpose commend the right hon gentleman for his endeavour in the debate which we support and on his compassion for carer give his own experience someone who care for their parent all day and then work couple of hour in the evening be preclude from receive carer allowance do the right hon gentleman agree that those people who do not get car allowance because they happen to work few hour should qualify be grateful to the hon gentleman for that point that should certainly be part of the review but one or two other issue which will talk about be critical to reform probably even before that at just week carer allowance be the low benefit of its kind for someone do hour of care week the minimum period for eligibility that be just an hour it be not just the low rate of the carer allowance that worry but the fact that the eligibility rule be inflexible and very badly design chief among they be the earning limit of week even for someone on minimum wage that be just hour and minute week the earn limit operate like cliff edge as soon as someone make week they lose the whole carer allowance every penny of the it act as significant barrier and major disincentive to work it mean carer on low income can not work bit more to help make end meet so it be bad for they bad for the person they be care for bad for their employer and bad for the economy but here be where thing get bad there be ten of thousand of carer who go slightly over the earning limit mostly without realise it maybe they pick up an extra shift happen to get an end of year bonus or understandably do not realise the way carer allowance operate in such daft way even though the department for work and pensions get regular alert from his majesty revenue and customs when people go over the earning limit it have not be tell carer and it keep pay carer allowance until one day out of the blue the carer get hit with demand to repay those overpayment which may have build up over month and year due to the dwp own inaction back in july tell the prime minister about one of my constituent andrea who live in chessington she be full time carer for her mum back in andrea decide to go back to work part time in charity shop mainly for her mental health she tell she inform the dwp at the time and it continue her payment five year later it write to she and say that no she now have to repay andrea say she feel harass bully and overwhelmed she now do just six hour unpaid work month to avoid go over the earning limit and get into more debt she say the whole thing make she want to give up work and give up care the right hon gentleman refer to mental health romi taylor be year old who care for her mother who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease romi recently win an award at the bbc radio lancashire make difference award you be there mr speaker many carer find care for love one to be lonely place this be year old taking care of her mother and not have time with her friend do the right hon gentleman agree that carer need to be recognise and that the support they require beyond benefit include mental health support should be order may just say to my constituency neighbour that intervention be mean to be short have list so if you want to make speech be more than happy because these contribution do matter but try not to make speech through intervention do follow mr shannon he will mislead you laughter thank you mr speaker the hon gentleman be of course right and pay tribute to his constituent who be lucky enough to be present the award by mr speaker he be right about the mental health of carer nhs datum show that the mental health of carer be twice as poor as it be for the population at large because of the isolation so that issue be absolutely part of this debate rise will let the right hon gentleman in but then do want to make some progress before the right hon gentleman resume his narrative he speak with huge authority on this subject can he underline what he tell the house before the previous intervention this be case where someone report what they be do be wrongly tell it be okay to proceed and be then hit with bill for thousand of pound retrospectively surely that be incompetence and maladministration be there not any way for that person to have recourse to justice the right hon gentleman make exactly the right point and as her mp be pursue that line of argument but we need change of culture and attitude at the dwp to be able to proceed with these case on behalf of our constituent she tell that the whole thing make she want to give up care and give up work that be how affected she have be who be it help when carer feel like that be sure that someone somewhere in the dwp or the treasury think this sort of penny pinch save the government money but they could not be more wrong it be million of carer like andrea who save the government money billion year accord to carers uk through the vital work they do for free when badly design government policy fail to support carer and instead push they over the edge the real cost an enormous cost be to taxpayer and the economy there be so many story like andrea government figure suggest that more than people have outstanding carer allowance debt some go back year accord to the dwp own figure last year alone there be overpayment due to the earning limit we have hear how carer have even be threaten with prosecution this be terrible scandal ten of thousand of carer become victim of system that be suppose to be there to support they although the story we have hear in recent month have be truly shocking they be not new the work and pensions committee launch an inquiry into this issue almost six year ago back in the national audit office publish its own report in the last government should have act then but they do nothing raise it with the last prime minister he do nothing conservative ministers fail to tackle it for the entirety of the last parliament they just pass it on to the new government as yet another part of their legacy raise the matter therefore at the new prime minister first oral question in july although he be non committal be genuinely pleased and grateful that minister have now announce review at least into the scandal of carer allowance overpayment whether that be in response to our motion will let other decide hope the minister will say lot more about the review when she speak and how the government be think about that hope the debate can be see as the first input to or kick off of that review certainly hope the minister will make it clear that the review will not be repeat of the type of review we have in the last parliament when conservative review be set up primarily for delay and kick issue into the long grass as hint at during today question time my concern about the review be that the evidence to make decision be already well found with two recent select committee report and mountain of evidence immediately available from organisation such as carers uk or carers trust and the national audit office carry out its second review in just five year over the last four month ask the secretary of state therefore to reshape the review that she have announce because it be self evident that the vast majority of overpayment of carer allowance should be write off immediately accept that there may be few case of genuine fraud in which that would not be appropriate but the dwp should not be persecute ten of thousand of carer whose overpayment be cause by the crazy cliff edge in the current carer allowance system and by the dwp own incompetence in fail to notify they of overpayment immediately some change could be make to the rule that be just common sense make it easy for carer to juggle work and care and thus boost our economy such as raise the earning limit and replace the cliff edge with taper there be change that do not need long review there be decision that can be take now or at least very quickly however as our motion say we need to go far for carer than these obvious and relatively simple decision the government should conduct full scale review of all support for carer so that we can make it easy for they to carry on care and to juggle care with work that will be well for they well for their love one and well for our economy urge the house to pass the motion let we not allow carer to be forget and ignore any long beg to move an amendment to leave out from society to the end and add believe it be essential that carer be provide with the support they need at the time they need it condemn the previous government for fail to address the scandal of demand for repayment of carer allowance and welcome the government review into how these overpayment have occur what good can be do to support those who have accrue they and how to reduce the risk of these problem occur in future let begin by pay tribute to the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey it be excellent that he have bring this subject to the house hear what he say about family carer as oppose to unpaid carer and while do not want to get involve in big linguistic debate think he make an important point that will be recognise by many carer up and down the country when we be make policy we should always listen to those with direct experience think that the right hon gentleman make his point on behalf of million of people and it be good that the house have hear it many people will be personally acquaint with this issue there be million carer in the uk and about million people be receive carer allowance so this debate be extremely important accord to the late census just under one in people in england and wales provide unpaid care but the subject of carer be not at the top of the political agenda nearly as often as it should be when be clinician people do not even realise that they could be label as carer and could apply to be carer and be unaware of the gateway that that would provide might the government consider do some work to make more people aware that they be undertake caring responsibility so that they can then obtain the support that be actually out there if they only know that be very good point and the hon gentleman experience as clinician be welcome the secretary of state have considerable experience of work with carer and will alert she to his comment because think she would appreciate what he have say we must never think this be not an issue that do not affect we all many of we will become carer if not now at some point in our life this affect all of we and everyone life be different support for family carer need to be tailor so that it work for the individual and take into account the different circumstance that people face when you be care for someone that be huge part of your life and it never stop even if you be work you be still think about that person for whom you be care day in day out it be not just physical job it be mental intellectual job and that be why the issue of stress and how carer be treat be so important join the minister in pay tribute to the million of carer in the country include those in my constituency do she agree that when someone be juggle the daily stress of life it can be difficult to remember to notify the dwp of change in circumstance which be require under the current arrangement will come to the review that we will be conduct but let make the general point that we in the government ought to be able to understand the reality of life and take that into account the position that have describe make the dire situation we have inherit all the more shameful family carer be be push to breaking point they have too often be force to quit job that they want to keep and could keep with the right support which isolate they and shrink our workforce with the right support we could help carer and help our economy as well to rub salt into the wound we have inherit system whereby busy carer already struggle under huge weight of responsibility have be leave have to repay large sum of overpaid carer allowance sometimes amount to thousand of pound it seem as though what be suppose to be safety net design to catch those in need be instead design to catch they out for some time constituent of mine have find that they be due to repay an overpayment always ask they whether they remember when they make their complaint all telephone conversation with the department be record so there be way of make it clear that the fault lie not with the applicant but with the department be there also way of ensure that those who have be penalise unfairly for follow the department advice should not have to pay that money as the hon member know the department be not responsible for the delivery of social security benefit in northern ireland but be sure that northern ireland department for communities will be keep close eye on the debate and will want to take his point into account this problem be one of the numerous way in which our social security system be fail the people of this country with million leave out of work because they be unwell and more than million child grow up poor and we have therefore move fast to fix the foundation of the dwp that include our set up taskforce to tackle child poverty extend the household support fund for six month and hold the first meeting of our new labour market advisory board the board expertise and fresh thinking will help we break down barrier to work such as an inability to balance pay work with family care this government have talk about duty of candour can the minister give an assurance that if people work at the dwp have information about maladministration and poor management of the service that they have witness and wish to come forward with that information they will be protect as whistleblower obviously whistleblowe be very important the hillsborough law that be be introduce be not my responsibility so the hon lady will understand that can not go over it extensively but will say as someone who work on the hillsborough issue for many year that it be very important to personally these problem be significant and give the scale of the challenge we will not be able to solve all of they overnight but we have take important first step include tackle the issue of overpayment of carer allowance relate to earning we have all hear the story of some of the thousand of carer who have be affect we have all hear and know about the stress and anxiety that it have cause they and we all want hope to establish the fact to address this problem we must first truly understand what have go wrong that be why the dwp have announce today an independent review of overpayment of carer allowance that have exceed the entitlement threshold the review will investigate how the overpayment have occur what can well be do to support those who have accrue they and how to reduce the risk of such problem occur in future we be delighted that liz sayce obe have agree to lead the review my colleague the minister for social security and disability my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms and the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend the member for stretford and urmston andrew western have already meet representative of carers uk along with carer themselves to discuss their report on overpayment and we will consider the finding of that report alongside the independent review on that point do the minister agree that there should be failsafe system if an overpayment be make and the receiver be not notify they should be allow not to pay back any of the money thank the hon member for his intervention be sure that many member will want to provide their view to the review which be welcome will come to some of the step we have already take to try to address the problem in moment it be vital to move quickly to understand exactly what have go wrong so that we can set out plan to put thing right right now we want to make it as easy as possible for carer to tell we when something have change that could affect their carer allowance we will continue to look at improve communication and we be now review the result of test of text alert to claimant who may be at risk of build up overpayment in response to the point that the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey make about the need for review assure he that we be not wait for an extensive review in order to act we have act already our pilot involve texte claimant to alert they when we be tell by hmrc that they have breach the current earning limit go forward we want to make the good use of earning datum already hold by hmrc in order to reduce the burden on busy carer which also respond to the point make early will the minister give way in moment if the result of the pilot be positive that will be the first step towards address the overpayment problem know that we need to do much more and there be many other issue but it will be good start be grateful to the minister for what she have just say but will she confirm that the remit of the review will go far into the structure of carer allowance many of we think that the earning limit be way too low and the whole cliff edge structure have to change can she confirm that the review will look at that thank the right hon member for his question go through the detail of what the review will look at just moment ago but there be wide problem with support for carer the right hon member will know that the department be currently look at whole host of area and we need family carer to be much well support both in work and when they be not work so we will look at the wide issue the review be about do that as have say but that do not mean that we be not fully aware of all the issue that carer face as be say address overpayment be only part of the action we need to take to ensure that unpaid carer get the support they need and deserve will the minister give way will make bit of progress we be look closely at how the benefit system currently work and it be right that the government focus on address overpayment of carer allowance as be just say we have set up an independent review but we have hear the concern about the broad system include the earning limit and the lack of taper as member will know early this year the work and pensions committee which be then chair by my right hon friend the member for east ham raise number of issue with carer allowance not only overpayment but the need for modernisation more generally as the right hon member for kingston and surbiton will know we have give the committee recommendation the detailed consideration that they deserve and we will respond later in the autumn order may gently say to the minister that she should look towards the chair when speak struggle to hear when she be constantly look the other way we operate in the third person which be why member should always speak through the chair otherwise struggle to catch the word apologise mr speaker you would think that after year would be able to get it right fourteen year yes year it just go to show that every day in this house be school day thank you mr speaker always welcome your suggestion can not pre empt the secretary of state decision but she will shortly start her uprating review of carer allowance follow the release of yesterday earning datum and today inflation figure and the outcome of that review will include the new weekly rate of carer allowance from april will the minister give way apology but feel that should keep go means test benefit can help where appropriate universal credit for example pay an extra year to unpaid family carer do not underestimate the challenge within the universal credit system and we want to ensure that carer who need it get that support as be say to the right hon member for kingston and surbiton moment ago we be look at different aspect of the system include by review universal credit to ensure that it do the job we all want it to do we will set out the detail in due course pension credit can also be pay to carer at high rate than what those without care responsibility receive and over carer receive an extra amount of pension credit because of their entitlement to carer allowance however we think that as many as pensioner who be eligible for pension credit be not receive it which be why the government have already take action to drive up pension credit take up last month we start national campaign to encourage eligible pensioner to check their eligibility and apply we be ask local authority to support that and as the house will know the secretary of state and the deputy prime minister write to they in august follow that we have see increase in application for pension credit since july with almost application in just eight week in november we will write to around pensioner in receipt of housing benefit who may be eligible but be not currently claim pension credit and encourage all family carer to check that they be receive all the support to which they be entitle the website have lot of information on carer allowance and of people claim online although traditional paper form be available for those who want to claim it that way know that organisation such as carers uk and citizens advice be also on hand and do fantastic job of give advice financial help for carer be really important but it be only one pillar of proper support system all of we need balance in life and that be important for carer too most carer of working age want to consider work in some form and not just for financial wellbeing but to enhance their life and the life of the person for whom they care we want to help family carer combine their caring responsibility with pay work where they can we will review the implementation of the carer leave act which give employ carer right to time off work for the first time and we will explore the benefit of pay leave while be mindful of the impact of any change on small employer through the employment rights bill we will ensure that flexible working which can play such an important role in help carer to balance their work and caring responsibility be available to all worker except where it be genuinely not feasible the government will carefully consider the finding of lord darzi independent review of the nhs which be very clear about the need for fresh approach to support family carer caring be demanding role in which no one can function at their good without ever have break and the well care fund include money that can be use for unpaid carer support include short break and respite service for carer as mention at the beginning of my contribution we will ensure that family carer voice be hear as we develop plan to create national care service as part of our reform to adult social care every day unpaid family carer step up when love one need their support without the contribution of family carer our country would not function the pressure on social care in this country be already unbearable without unpaid family carer it would become completely untenable for all the talk of billion black hole the value that carer give to the economy be billion do the minister agree that it be an absolute scandal that many carer be struggle financially our country be in very serious financial situation indeed as say at the beginning of my speech anyone who think that the issue of care ought not to be right at the top of the political agenda be labour under serious misapprehension this be an important subject which be why be proud of the first step that this government have already take to improve support for carer and to address the overpayment of carer allowance which have cause so much distress for thousand of people this show our commitment to recognise and value the vital role that carer play in our community of course there be much more to do so it be my hope that as we deliver the fundamental change that we need we can work together with carer organisation and with carer themselves with renew sense of purpose to ensure that carer get all the support they need to carry out the incredible work of care and to live full and fulfil life call the shadow minister welcome this debate on this important matter there be unanimity across the house that carer up and down this country do an extraordinary job often in very difficult circumstance we owe they huge amount and not only for the compassion and social value that their work bring but for the financial and fiscal benefit as carers uk have identify because of the cost that the taxpayer be not require to pick up recognise the experience that the leader of the liberal democrats have in this area through his campaigning and his personal experience think he say that it be good that the liberal democrats have bring forward motion today that be devoid of any politic but be not sure that entirely agree with he the motion of course contain much that we can all agree on but the relevant poisonous pill within it will ensure that when we divide later confidently predict that the motion will fall only the liberal democrats and perhaps few other minority party will go through the aye lobby they will then be able to crank up the risographs so that their leaflet can say that only they care about this particular matter that be far from the truth my party the official opposition care very deeply when we be in government we bring forward number of measure to ensure that we support those carer the level of carer allowance have increase by since in it be my party that bring in the statutory entitlement to one week per year of carer leave it be only last year that we through the well care fund provide million to those in desperate need of respite from their caring duty the care act of this year increase the right of carer and also the duty place upon local authority be also pleased to tell the house that even more recently my hon friend the member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies the shadow minister for women and equalities attend an event here host by carers uk so that we could continue that really important dialogue hope that the right hon gentleman will correct the record because the unpaid carer break be bring in by the private member bill of my hon friend the member for north east fife wendy chamberlain it be not bring in by the conservative government think the right hon gentleman will find that that measure be support by our no no most private members bill be not support by the government of the day and therefore make no progress we be happy whatever legislative vehicle be available to ensure that that important measure come into effect on our watch let speak for moment about the complexity of carer allowance because this be really important it go to the heart of many of the assertion that have be make in the chamber today this be how it work it be per week we expect somebody who be in receipt of that benefit to be provide care for hour or more to one or more individual there be an element of trust in the way the benefit work because the department for work and pensions can not establish exactly what individual be do up and down the country and therefore there be an earning limit which be proxy for the amount of pay work that somebody be do rather than the amount of time they be spend look after love one that be the purpose of the limit complication which have not yet be raise in this debate be that someone income have to be adjust in order to determine whether they be above or below that limit there be adjustment for example they can reduce their declare income in this respect by of any pension contribution they may make they can adjust the amount of income that they compare to the limit for any equipment that they purchase in respect of their caring obligation there be also travel cost if someone be self employ various business cost can also see reduction in the level of income this lie at the heart of why there be challenge in notify people of whether they be above or below the earning limit because it be impossible at the centre to determine the answer to that question for the reason that have give the right hon gentleman espouse the benefit of cross party work in an interesting way whatever adjustment be make to the earning limit will he join those on the liberal democrat benches in ask the minister to allow high level of earning that be the crucial factor that prevent so many people who badly need carer allowance from get it the hon gentleman make an important point and of course the motion state that there should be an increase an unspecified amount but it be there none the less think the answer to his question be that it be balance because the high we put up the earning limit and the more generous we be to carer which of course be something we all want to do the more people can earn and the long they can work potentially therefore if this be act as proxy for the amount that people be work they might not have the real time to spend hour week care for love one so it be inevitably balance certainly accept that this be worth review and note that the minister for social security and disability the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms when he chair the work and pensions committee call forcefully for significant increase in the level of carer allowance the right hon gentleman have obviously set out number of the adjustment that need to be make but in do so he have outline just how complex the system be and therefore exactly why we have have the scandal in the first instance do he agree that we should be ask the minister to ensure that in the carer allowance review we simplify this process can assure he that many unpaid carer be not do hour week indeed what we want ideally be system that be as simple as possible the motion suggest that we bring in taper but that would be complication of the system will come to why there be problem with that it be easy to suggest these thing but the detail often make they really quite complicated the last government make it clear when someone apply for this particular benefit exactly what the arrangement be when uprating occur every year we write to everybody to explain the uprating and to inquire as to whether any change in their circumstance or earning might impact their entitlement to benefit and it be we not this government who in our may update to our fraud plan bring in the pilot for texte to alert those on carer allowance that they may say may because the department will not know be close to exceed the earning limit be pleased that the minister have indicate that the government will continue with our fine work but let we be very clear who it be that start those particular measure on that point would the right hon member therefore accept that the department for work and pensions be in complete mess and that unpaid carer in our constituency be have to pay the price and bear the brunt of that because the system be clearly not work for they no would not be not rule out the possibility that it may yet become mess but certainly on our watch it be never mess in fact it dispense about billion worth of transfer payment both to pensioner and through the benefit system and by and large it do remarkable job in do that efficiently want to pay tribute to all the official and civil servant that work in that department they work incredibly hard and for the vast majority of their time produce outstanding result none the less of course we can always point to element of the system where thing break down and we must always strive to get well that be why welcome the government review the suggestion that the government should not seek the repayment of overpayment be absurd we can not go that far if someone go over threshold we can not say do not worry about it we might as well not have the threshold in the first place by all mean change the threshold that may be perfectly legitimate thing to do otherwise the threshold should be remove altogether some member will perfectly legitimately raise failing in the system but when be secretary of state there be example of fraud for instance one individual be work hour week as taxi driver while apparently still have the time to spend hour week look after love one to my mind that be clearly fraud so we can not write off absolutely everything the department do the right thing by look at this issue on case by case basis if carer receive bonus from their employer for do good job and it take they over the threshold should they lose their carer allowance quite possibly not which be why the department operate on case by case basis that be the correct approach rather than blanket approach that say it do not matter if someone go over the threshold as say if there be never go to be requirement for repayment we might as well not have threshold at all in some case go over the threshold be egregious the government know this and they will have to take it into account when he be secretary of state do the right hon gentleman ask what proportion of overpayment be due to egregious fraud and what proportion be due to be small amount over the earning limit it be difficult to give precise answer what do the right hon gentleman mean by small amount over the earning limit we know that for the vast majority of the thousand of people in this situation it will almost certainly be small amount include some very small amount none the less fraud and error be significant challenge across the benefit system and need to be address any responsible government will take that approach simply to say we have problem so we should take off the brake and have no limit we should let people claim what they like whatever it might be even if it be fraud as suggest by the leader of the liberal democrats be not viable will the right hon gentleman give way will give way but invite the right hon gentleman to explain how he would deal with fraud when he be push for none of the overpayment to be return make it very clear in my speech that there could be example of fraud so ask the right hon gentleman to check the record could not have be clear and we have talk about this at length in other forum indeed we make it clear at the general election be afraid that the right hon gentleman have show to the house that he fail to get grip of this issue when he be secretary of state he recognise that the vast majority of overpayment be small amount often because the dwp in which he be secretary of state do not pass on information to hmrc be afraid that he be dig hole for himself regardless of what the right hon gentleman may or may not have say in his opening remark the text of the motion can not be dispute on the point of whether anyone should be expect to repay the motion say that this house believe that carer should not be force to face the stress humiliation and fear cause by demand for repayment of carer allowance to that suggest everyone the motion go on to say that the government should write off exist overpayment immediately it be clear and obvious that that would include any fraudulent payment it may be that the earning limit could be increase but there would be fiscal cost indeed the liberal democrat manifesto reform would cost about billion which be significant we would have to take account of the balance between be more generous to carer and respect the hour rule if that remain finally whenever there be cliff edge it be suggest that tapering will solve the problem but that neglect the fact that it introduce complexity which be the very thing that universal credit for example be design to iron out the system be like spaghetti and nobody could quite understand how it work in the tax system for example the personal allowance taper away after many people just stop work far when they reach that level of earning because it be not worth their while give the marginal tax rate there be an interplay between universal credit and carer allowance because people who earn more will end up have their carer allowance withdraw there be already taper within carer allowance to make sure that work pay so that as people earn more their benefit be reduce but not sufficiently to make they bad off under the system advocate by the liberal democrats there will be two taper in two interact benefit which do not think would well serve anybody least of all carer madam deputy speaker be seek my conclusion welcome this motion and like other party in this house we stand four square behind our carer who do an extraordinary job wish the government well with their review which we will consider seriously and objectively as we be all on the side of carer stand by our record in office of which be proud very much welcome the minister opening comment it be clear that she be fully cognisant of many of the issue that be about to raise also welcome the announcement of the independent government review of carer allowance overpayment which hope will be carry out urgently hope it will consider write off substantial overpayment where it be clear that carer should have be notify soon on the wide issue face by unpaid carer start by read out an email from constituent care for my mother who have alzheimer and vascular dementia plus severe osteoarthritis for several year at the time of this if the person require care be deem capable of perform any self care task only part of the carer allowance be pay my mother would occasionally wipe flannel over her face and be therefore deem to be capable of self care despite all other evidence care for someone be not to job it be often hour job as in my case with no break for the carer as few be ever tell about respite care those who manage employment outside the home be also overburden as they have no time to decompress from their pay employment before have to spend their time at home care for someone due to the nature of be carer the carer physical and mental health often decline and go untreated as they often have no help with their situation from the authorities or should they have they sibling that alone can impact the carer own physical and mental health but carer go unnoticed until there be crisis to only receive the paltry current carer allowance which will barely cover utility and council tax ignore food and clothing be an insult to people who be work far hard than most but remain unseen as it be not deem to be real job and be consider easy only those who have care for another adult know this be blatantly untrue sadly my constituent feeling be not rare many people care for their love one out of love and all too often it impact on their ability to work result in many live in poverty new report from carers uk and wpi economics find that million unpaid carer be live in poverty while one in of all carer be in deep poverty it be not hard to understand why as carer allowance be the low benefit of its kind currently just week and it be available only to carer who can prove that they provide more than hour of unpaid care week do my hon friend agree that the evidence show that it be disproportionately woman who be carer and therefore woman who experience those level of poverty because of the low figure she mention welcome my hon friend comment and agree with they to solve the crisis care uk modelling suggest that an immediate uplift an increase in the earning limit and an earning taper would lift huge number out of poverty however number of brutal loophole already highlight by the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey need to be address urgently include the rule on young carer and student many people do not know that carer allowance be not pay to those study for more than hour week number of young carer in salford have tell that that mean they be often exclude from any support the pressure on they to study and care for their love one be immense all while often live in extreme poverty sadly many feel they have no option but to leave education age far if carer be look after more than one person for cumulative amount of hour week the carer be not eligible to receive carer allowance if two people share the care each provide hour week only one person can claim car allowance support the sentiment that we need more funding and support for carer more finance more money but the email the hon lady read out powerfully show that it be not just money that carer need they need much broad support to give respite and relief and to allow they to address their own mental health concern that arise from their job as well as support to stay in education long as she mention although money be important do she agree that carer need the much wide community support that charity and other local group can give the hon gentleman make an important point unfortunately the ability of local authority to reach out to carer who be struggle and directly offer they the respite care they should be entitle to have be hamper certainly in the past to year the burden of step in have be leave to many charity for those who live in an area with large charitable presence that be fantastic but unfortunately not lot of unpaid carer live in such area that be an issue that the government must grapple with another brutal issue which be relatively unknown be that of pension as far as be aware carer allowance do not get pay to those in receipt of the state pension unless the state pension amount be low than the weekly value of carer allowance as with the pension credit threshold at the moment huge number of people be just over the cusp of eligibility they live in poverty but can not access the help they need there be another brutal loophole for pensioner receive care the government website currently state when you get carer allowance the person you care for will usually stop get severe disability premium pay with their benefit or an extra amount for severe disability pay with pension credit that leave one of my constituent whose daughter provide care but do not live with she in situation where she be not entitle to the top up in pension credit that she should be entitle to which she need to survive and to deal with her daily living cost as severely disabled person want to highlight those point but will bring my comment to close as many colleague want to speak welcome the encourage comment make by my hon friend on the government front bench encourage they to address the loophole that have be mention urgently and as be sure they be do already to encourage action from the chancellor at the upcoming budget so that we can provide the financial and social support our unpaid carer desperately need rise order this be heavily subscribe debate and be determined to get everybody in so this be fair warning after the next speaker back benchers will be limit to three minute and maiden speech will be limit to five minute these will be hard limit to ensure everybody get in after our next speaker wendy chamberlain who have unlimited time declare an interest as be in the process of join the board of fife carers in an unpaid capacity it be privilege to join the organisation have work with unpaid carer throughout the past few year as constituency mp for north east fife and through the passage of my private member bill that become the carer leave act if hon member want to learn more widely about carer they may wish to read my adjournment debate on the subject which take place in the first few week of this parliament where talk about the need for strategy on carer to ensure that carer get the cross cut governmental and departmental support they need will not touch on the overpayment scandal specifically but welcome the announcement of the review after month of campaigning by my dear friend the leader of the liberal democrat party my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey as well as by the liberal democrats carer charity and journalist however want to raise some point about the carer allowance more generally recently ask the minister responsible for carer allowance the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms write question about review of how car allowance be work the response say this government will keep eligibility criterion and process of carer allowance under review to see if it be meet its objective that response pose more question than it provide answer what be the government objective for carer allowance be they ever review how do they know if they be meet they what metric be be use what would happen if it be find that the objective be not be meet assume that the objective of carer allowance be to keep unpaid carer out of poverty give the additional barrier they face to work and the additional cost they face through their caring also assume that we want to help unpaid carer to stay link to the workplace if possible through part time work or training on any assessment carer allowance be fail these objective it be failure when third of household in receipt of carer allowance be class as food insecure compare with of household as whole when carers uk research from find that people per day who be care be give up work and when the rate of poverty among unpaid carer be high than among non carer one immediate remedy that could be consider as be set out in our motion be an increase in carer allowance it may not seem much in the big scheme of thing but during the pandemic we see the impact of the uplift to universal credit which deliver an immediate and marked fall in food bank use we must do all we can to support people into work and to stay in work so that they be not rely on carer allowance to get by that point refer to the earning allowance which stop carer from work more than hour week on the minimum wage before lose carer allowance as have already be discuss there be no taper rate so as soon as carer earn penny more the allowance go bizarrely yearly increase to the allowance be not peg to change to the national minimum wage historically people could work for hour before they lose carer allowance some of the scandal we have see could be because people have continue to make those assumption we need to take the complexity out of the system it be completely reasonable for people to assume that if they be earn national minimum wage and receive carer allowance in one financial year they can continue to do so in the follow financial year as long as they do not increase their hour but that be not how the system work the national minimum wage go up by this year but the earning allowance do not go up at all that sound to like system set up to make people fail should we not be enable people to take on more hour and to progress in their job if they can we know that often people especially those who be below or near the poverty line as too many unpaid carer be be scared to risk lose their benefit in case that do not work out one of the unseen outcome of the scandal be that people be simply not look for work or to get into employment because they be scared about the consequence many young carer have high level of absence from school and there be barrier to they access education potentially if we do not help they to claim carer allowance when they be entitle to do so they will never go into work and be able to make contribution fife young carers in my constituency support people up to the age of we want to encourage young carer to complete their education so they have the good possible option later to return to my cross cut strategy the department for work and pensions may think that it be for the department for education to support young people however as the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey say under the rule do vocational qualification could preclude somebody from receive carer allowance as level be one of the qualification that fall into that trap she be right that we need to think about how we be potentially inhibit those young people in employment and training from move forward we need to ensure that we improve young people outcome the minister will know that employment among unpaid carer be about more than just benefit we welcome her reference to the carer leave act in her opening remark and the fact that the government be look for that leave to be pay which have long be party policy of the liberal democrats however do have to express my disappointment that there be no sign of pay leave in the employment rights bill because there be real opportunity there to move the matter forward would appreciate it if in her closing remark the minister provide an update on the likely timescale in relation to the carer leave act be concerned that since the implementation of the act we do not actually know what the take up of carer leave be be hear worrying anecdote that six month after the legislation be fully implement some company be still not aware of or properly record carer leave part of that be because the communication from the then government be not good enough unless somebody be start small business or actively look for these detail they would not find anything on carer leave would like to raise one final point with the minister again the hon member for salford highlight this be often contact by constituent who be upset to find that have retire they have lose their carer allowance or in scotland the carer support payment because they be claim their state pension we know that female pensioner be more likely to be in poverty because of the work life that they have have or not have as result of raise their family and that unpaid carer be more likely to be female and old would like the minister to pick up on that point because too many pensioner be in poverty this winter as well as carry care responsibility call gill german to make her maiden speech be delighted to make my maiden speech in this debate today dw mor falch fod yn sefyll yma be so proud to be

to make it the very good it can be for our family for our community for all of we colleague have outline the scale of the crisis so shall focus on story of one of my constituent in carshalton and wallington she be tell that she have to repay more than in carer allowance payment this constituent already make huge sacrifice to keep her family afloat while care for her disabled son she give up her full time job to take on caring responsibility and have limit her part time hour to ensure that she remain qualified for carer allowance it make so angry to hear how meticulously she try to manage her pay cheque each month only to have it throw in her face she turn down pay rise turn down overtime and turn down christmas bonus to ensure that she stay under the limit her employer agree to keep she on an advance rota to help she plan her earning despite her diligence she receive no notice no warning and no forgiveness when one day the payment stop and the bill come in for over two grand here be the bit that really get the repayment demand that she receive be for the entire entitlement for each occasion when she earn too much that mean that the small indiscretion come with the heavy of consequence in one month it be because she earn too much in another it be it get bad one november she be over the limit not even an hour work in london finally and most depressingly she once dare to earn too much she owe the whole of the allowance back for each of those period and then fine to boot from the department for work and pensions this be nothing short of national scandal and the dwp should be ashamed of itself today the liberal democrats be call on the government to right this wrong to stop pursue hard work carer for these innocent overpayment and then to fix the system that let this scandal emerge in the first place we need to taper the allowance raise the earning limit and treat carer with the compassion they deserve be conscious of time so finally welcome and be encourage by the minister comment about the review however for it to be successful carer need to play big part and have full input we also need to make sure that carer now in debt distress get some immediate reassurance and support and do not have to wait until the end of the review call dan aldridge to make his maiden speech be honour to make my maiden address during this debate on carer allowance we all know people who be work tirelessly to care for love one indeed make life well for those who sacrifice so much be one of the main reason make the decision to run for election to this place in weston

commission on the future of social care in england we listen to unpaid family carer who tell we that they be stretch to breaking point they give selflessly but at huge cost to their own wellbeing and as we have hear in the debate they make financial sacrifice as caring can affect their ability to work they must fight every day to get care and support for their love one they do so with support from fantastic organisation such as carers resource in my constituency in the care and support reimagined report we propose new deal for carer to ensure that they be value and can give out of love and not necessity however as we have hear they be be punish for try to juggle care and work some million carer be try to do that but find that they be inadvertently breach the earning threshold with the result that they face the issue of overpayment as have write to the minister for social security and disability my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms it scandal that the last government know about that there be nao and select committee report on their desk but do nothing so welcome this government have seize the issue and set up the independent review and look forward to

go and see my wife every morning look after she and see what need to be do they be fantastic people and owe they such big debt this be where might try the patience of the house slightly madam deputy speaker because want to mention an aspect that be not help those carer the remuneration that they receive for mileage in scotland carer get per mile for the first mile and after mile they get per mile that be not good news give the vastness of my constituency half the size of wales they tell and the mileage that carer have to cover lot of those wonderful people be say enough be enough pack up and call it day in north west sutherland and wester ross in particular we have an age population that desperately need that kind of support but carer be just give up and go it be not because they do not care for the people they be help but because they simply can not afford it the cost of run their car be far great than what they receive for the vast mileage involve my husband be full time carer for his mother who have have three stroke by look after people in their home and save life long term carer make very large saving for the nhs give how much carer save the nhs in long term out of hospital care provision we should as cross party endeavour reconsider the compensation for mileage the hon lady make very wise point that demonstrate the interconnected nature of unpaid carer and professional carer because the good solution come when they work together will conclude with this we have problem it be perhaps not pertinent to the minister who be before we today but hope that the treasury will consider the issue of remuneration rate for mileage perhaps with the scottish government those rate have not be revisit since and since then we have have about inflation we can see what be wrong let we sort the problem thank the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey for bring this debate today pay tribute to my hon friend the members for clwyd north gill german and for weston super mare dan aldridge and to the hon member for torbay steve darling for their maiden speech first put on record my thank to carer across bexleyheath and crayford and to fantastic local charity include bexley snap bexley voice bexley mencap carers support bexley crossroads care evergreen care mind in bexley and irish community services for all they do to support community in my patch be carer be often unexpected we all see people who come to we when love one be diagnose as refer to in my maiden speech my wife and know at day when one of our child be diagnose with cerebral palsy day to day we see what it mean to be carer in the support we have to give she have think today about the pressure that exist not just the mental health and caring pressure but the pressure of manage the bureaucracy such as apply for and renew your freedom pass and blue badge deal with the administration of appointment at four different hospital in our daughter case the constant appointment and call to ensure your child wheelchair be work to support they organise and constantly chase for the correct equipment at home reapplye for disability living allowance every three year try to find the respite to allow you break and the ability to work and explore the minefield that come with apply for disabled facility grant there be also the complexity of be an employer under the direct payment system arrange shift issue contract run payroll every month pay insurance calculate your staff holiday and ensure the support be there just to get in our case eight hour care per week have twice exhaust the complaint process with our conservative local authority through stage and stage complaint on one occasion they do not pay our carer for six week on another occasion they do not make those payment at the national minimum wage that all add to the burden and pressure on carer in our case we do not claim carer allowance but know at first hand the pressure of have to battle the system when it be not work for you hope that the review set up today will look at the issue of overpayment and at other issue that really need to be resolve for those on the frontline as have say previously will carry on press the government to create sustainable national care service that work for unpaid carer sector partner and carer organisation as part of that process will be support the government amendment today as the first step to make thing easy for carer in the year ahead praise hon member for their excellent contribution and maiden speech unpaid carer be the hidden backbone of our social care system whether they be parent or grandparent care for child with special educational need or disability individual support spouse or sibling or those step in to care for relative in need those carer provide tireless support with little recognition or help we have already hear from my hon friend and from member across the house about the scandal of the carer allowance overpayment and their devastating impact on family up and down the country in my constituency countless carer be do extraordinary work often at great personal cost many be struggle to balance their caring responsibility with their own health their financial stability and for some even their job the weight of those responsibility can be overwhelming especially without access to proper support service such as respite care we need statutory guarantee of respite break for carer because those break be essential for give carer the time to rest and recharge so that they can continue provide vital care at the same time we can not ignore the financial pressure that carer face carer allowance be simply not enough to live on it be the low benefit of its kind and it be unacceptable that carer many of whom be unable to work due to their caring duty be leave struggle to make end meet we need to see fair increase in carer allowance and an uplift of the threshold which would make real difference for family in my constituency ensure that carer be not force into poverty while look after their love one if you will allow madam deputy speaker also want to raise the issue of care provide by young people in stratford on avon many young people in full time education be balance schoolwork and study with care for parent or sibling often without the support they need to succeed in both role would like young carer voice to be hear in the government review of carer allowance no young carer should be leave behind simply because they have take on the responsibility of care for their love one the government must set an urgent timetable for review carer allowance and simplify the system to show carer that they be value for the essential work they do in today britain for million of unpaid carer in west brom and around the uk life be hard enough they be the backbone of our care system yet they be woefully under support and under recognised take care of someone be the most generous act of human kindness but the former government repay those act of service with hostile interview and demand for repayment and by fight carer in the court welcome this new government independent review which recognise the invaluable contribution that carer make the review will investigate the payment of carer allowance how it be allow to happen in the first place and more importantly how we can make sure it never happen again know what it be like to witness the care that one person can show to another whether that care be pay or unpaid my grandmother my nanny as we call she be look after in the final year of her life in care home the team there provide tender care hour day and they make life fun my nanny be irish and even into her she be very partial to half pint of guinness which the care home always provide they always make st patrick day good fun that care do not stop when she finally pass away when the car go past the care home on the day of her funeral all the staff be line up with irish flag to wave her goodbye this labour government be go to give pay and unpaid carer the recognition right and pay that they deserve and create sustainable national care service and be very proud to be part of that in my borough of sandwell as whole the percentage of people provide over hour of unpaid care week be well above the national average and for many people in my constituency care for their love one be more than full time job those who be able to go to work find themselves have to restrict their hour for fear that they will inadvertently overstep the earning limit during the election meet woman in west bromwich who be in exactly that situation she work as clean in addition to care for family member she be really struggle to make end meet but feel trap for fear of the penalty she would incur if she go even few penny over the earning limit the motion table by the liberal democrats be right to condemn the previous government for fail to address the scandal of repayment lot of carer be not even notify that they have exceed the earning threshold for some their allowance be stop without warn cause severe financial difficulty other will spend year repay with the anxiety and stress that that bring on top of all the other responsibility that unpaid carer take on for their love one they have be make to feel like criminal can you imagine as such support the government intention to quickly get to the bottom of carer allowance overpayment and consider how we provide support for unpaid carer many of whom have be push to breaking point just for look after the people they love sophie clare oliver and wendy be some of the most resilient people know they be all eastbournians they would all do anything for their family and they be all carer they be among the carer in eastbourne and promise they that would use opportunity such as this debate to recognise their resilience and give they and their family voice today strive to do exactly that strive to do it particularly with respect to the need for wide support to carer which the motion mention sophie ticehurst and her family care for sophie year old brother jack who have autism and be non verbal they rely on the linden court day centre which support people with learn disability for jack care but also for their respite but the centre face closure after year of conservative underfunding and it would be devastating for they if that go ahead as would the propose closure of milton grange day centre particularly for people with dementia again down to the conservative county council that place serve as essential respite to clare whose year old mum benefit from its amazing care where be the care for the carer we urgently need the government to intervene to properly fund our local authority so that these essential care resource can be protect also pay tribute to oliver davis young carer in my constituency he be year old eastbournian and since the age of eight have care for his mum who live with significant cardiac issue and the long term effect of stroke his mum say that he never complain about be young carer oliver do we all proud in fact he also win bbc make difference award for be young carer across surrey and sussex and he also do the local charity care for the carers proud which he work with to advocate for young carer like he lastly want to mention wendy turner different type of family carer kinship carer whom you

foster allowance that need to change where be the care for the carer our carer do so much to lift people up but time after time our system wear they down enough be enough so say to the government dignify their experience with action honour their story with reform and never take our carer for grant do not want to be see be too kind to fellow sussex mp but kinship carer be indeed visit here

have share such powerful personal testimony my hon friend the members for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis and for west bromwich sarah coombes warmly welcome the fact that the liberal democrats choose to provide this opportunity for we to discuss this important issue pay tribute to the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey for share his personal experience as carer and rightly move this issue up the political agenda pay tribute to the minister for social security and disability my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms whose previous work chair the work and pensions committee do so much to highlight the injustice of the overpayment scandal be pleased to see he in his government role able to put into action all that work for the past year carer have be woefully let down by the conservatives and they have be let down today by their completely inadequate defence of the overpayment scandal after decade of cut too many be on the waiting list for local authority care and local authority service have be call upon time and again to do more with less carer like shirley islam one of the register unpaid care in the city of london who meet to highlight her experience as carer have bear the brunt of that failure as have carer from westminster rethink mental illness who also speak with recently look forward to work with local resident on this issue nowhere be the previous government failure to administer basic service more evident than when it come to carer under the previous government the department for work and pensions saddle thousand of carer with unnecessary financial burden at time when they have more than enough on their plate include the carer who receive fine of up to so today they need to hear these word we be sorry for the injustice and indignity you have suffer under the previous government we will do everything that we can to put they right thank you for your work and service at the election the prime minister promise politic that tread more lightly on people life so be glad that in today announcement the department have scrap the plan replacement of cash payment to carer with voucher we should not be tell carer how to spend their own money eagerly await the announcement of national care service as promise in our general election manifesto and know that my constituent do too look forward to the publication of the government review and the delivery of much need and long await justice commend my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey for introduce this debate echo his call for an end to unfair overpayment claim as result of the earning limit and for comprehensive review of support for carer will now share some story about carer who have meet over the year or who be in my constituency as volunteer for the motor neurone disease association have see the toll that that terrible disease take on family and their carer many of the people who get mnd be elderly and they see their life change from relax retirement with their partner after many year of work to one person have mnd and their spouse become carer that be very challenging for people who have lead self sufficient life and lose their mobility and independence it be also important as my hon friend the member for stratford on avon manuela perteghella say that we consider the experience of the next generation of carer sometimes motor neurone disease can affect much young people one person support be single parent with four year old child see the impact that care responsibility can have on child and young carer even where really good care arrangement be in place there be still the physical and emotional toll of be an unpaid carer in oxfordshire we have young carer the be free young carers charity support around of they it have be estimate that family that have young carer earn more than those who do not have young carer but while contribute huge economic benefit young carer be one and half time more likely to have long term illness or special educational need child be call katie register with be free young carers in march she care for her twin sister who have autism in april katie attend one to one session that enable she to open up about how she be feel and the support she need to continue her schoolwork later that year katie dad be diagnose with ms which add further pressure and lead katie sister to try to take her own life after such series of event many child would have struggle but katie have cop and be do well she have attend respite trip over the past two year include the young carer festival and have lovely group of friend she be also member of the charity youth panel she have speak about the be free young carers charity on local television news it be vital that we support all carer include young carer such as katie commend the motion to the house as have already mention few time in this place carer play significant role in my journey to this chamber work at first hand with young carer for two and half year until be elect really welcome the use of the term family carer in this debate because the charity work for be call action for family carers always welcome an opportunity to speak on this issue recognise that young carer be not eligible for the allowance that we be talk about but beg this chamber permission to mention the subject in this debate and at every opportunity in my job support specifically young carer see every day the toll that care take in day to day life recognise that all carer have be give raw deal push to their limit their breaking point in look after people they care about and love since be elect to this place have hear from carer who have suffer massive amount of anxiety due to the pressure put on they because of the overpayment scandal people whose life have change who have give up career to become carer for their love one and of course young people who do not even consider go on to high education because of the anxiety leave their cared one behind would cause this can not go on the situation be not only untenable but unworkable and above all it be damaging to those who we rely on in our most vulnerable moment that be why welcome wholeheartedly the government announcement today that they will launch an independent review of the carer allowance overpayment lead by an expert in the matter this review will cut through the mistake make under the last government lie bare what we can learn and help we to avoid these mistake in the future there be no simple solution to improve the situation for unpaid carer but this announcement show clear commitment to find the good way to improve it for as many as possible for as long as possible will say it again carer be unsung hero and we owe it to these unsung hero whose contribution be often understate and unappreciated to do this carer be the backbone of our society and this review be an important step in repay our debt to they carer in my constituency have tell how they feel undervalued and invisible they provide essential care to their love one yet their contribution be rarely recognise there be carer such as harry resident in my constituency who provide care for his son who feel that the work he do be take for grant harry care for his son because he want to be there when his son need he but he be not give the recognition he deserve he receive week in carer allowance but when harry hour be extend at work by just minute week to allow one of his colleague to get to work on time after they have finish the school run something that harry be of course happy to agree to he have no idea that despite inform the dwp and be tell that it be all okay he would be accidentally overpay carer allowance then the threat of fine and prosecution come from the dwp to say that it add unnecessary stress to harry life and his son life be really large understatement the health and wellbeing of carer be critical issue for we and many carer experience physical and mental health issue due to the demand of their caring responsibility there be carer such as margret in my constituency who care for her year old son with learn disability with her caring responsibility she be no long able to work she find the balance between her pay job and her unpaid job too much to handle margret tell how she rarely get out of the house without her son she have lose her network of friend and now feel isolate carer such as margret struggle to access the respite care they need due to high cost and the lack of availability the liberal democrats believe that every carer should have access to regular and high quality respite care and we want to introduce statutory guarantee of regular respite break for unpaid carer because carer be the backbone of our society they provide essential support to their love one often at great personal cost and the liberal democrats want to ensure that they receive the support they need when they need it thank the liberal democrats for use this opposition day for this important issue also thank durham county carers support for the work it do across the county this topic be very personal to because be parent carer for my daughter maria for year the whole of her life in fact maria live with severe cerebral palsy and need round the clock care also have two young child so totally understand the issue of exhaustion stress and fear as well as the tremendous joy of look after love one the north east be region of unpaid care with of the adult population in the census provide unpaid care for more than hour week as we have hear it be woman who be do the hard graft the women of the north report which encourage the minister to read if she have not already do so state that many woman who support family or friend do not even identify as carer they just get on with it regardless of the effect it have on their health and wellbeing woman in their be provide more unpaid care than the national average in fact they be contribute billion worth of unpaid care to the british economy each year again this be high than the national average make the carer allowance scandal all the more infuriating reflect on my own experience when maria be and her sibling be eight and nine we decide that would go to university must have be mad know that be for my own personal development and in the hope that would get decent job in the future unfortunately that mean be not get car allowance any more the course be class as full time but there be actually only nine hour of contact time so have plenty of time to look after maria as well not only be not earn but lose that tiny allowance be try to better myself for the future and it be struggle we go into debt it be something we really could have do without therefore welcome the comment by the minister and welcome the fact that the government will work collaboratively with those on the frontline because that would have mean an awful lot to have one final comment want the government to crack on with this policy as soon as possible because unpaid carer can not wait minute long especially those in the north may begin by express my appreciation of the family carer in the bishop auckland constituency accord to helpful researcher in the commons library one in seven of my constituent provide at least an hour of unpaid care each week and over half of they be eligible for carer allowance nationwide as we have hear our army of family carer be the equivalent of second nhs agree with the criticism make by the shadow secretary of state that we must not risk open the door to fraud and it be precisely because believe in the welfare state that think it must always be watertight and widely perceive as fair however be concerned that in huge number of case be inclined to believe that it be the majority of case overpaid carer allowance be the result of inadvertent error as other have say this be complicated benefit and when so many stressed family carer find themselves have to pay back large sum of money there must be some onus on the government to take responsibility this issue be so widespread that think every mp in this place will have be contact by constituent face hardship these be decent honest people who work hard who serve their family and community and who ask for little and they feel as though they be be treat like criminal while the government have become the nation big debt collector if may will briefly raise specific issue that two of my constituent have raise with they be be require to pay back thousand of pound because of inadvertently earn just above the earning threshold however as they have point out to carer allowance be count as income in universal credit claim so have they not claim it they would have receive more in universal credit gently urge the minister to consider this point as part of the review as people be not only be push into hardship due to be make to pay back overpayment but may actually be bad off on aggregate than if they have never claim my hon friend rightly point out that this be huge cause of stress to people not only that but carer be actually leave work limit their hour and not take on additional responsibility will he join in call on the shadow secretary of state to apologise to the carer who have outstanding carer allowance overpayment to total value of million this sit among the many injustice that the new government have to deal with and think an apology be in order in conclusion welcome this government review think there have be some excellent contribution from all part of the house with some really serious issue raise such as student lose their eligibility to claim my constituent point about universal credit and the point about respite care and young carer and do not think anyone have even mention kinship carer hope that this review will take account of all these thing so that we can deliver fair deal for britain army of unpaid carer thank the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey for secure this important debate have almost constituent in barking who be unpaid carer provide vital and caring backbone for the community my constituency have one of the high number of carer in the country and we know that if those individual stop care and deliver their vital role our overstretch care system would crumble and the economy grind to halt perhaps most importantly the most vulnerable people in our community would stop receive the care and compassion that they get from their relative and friend but carer do not stop because they care about their friend or family member who need that support whether it be young carer look after parent or daughter or son look after their elderly parent such care be vital in our community instead of system that provide they with safety net to help with the additional cost that come with care for someone the system the government have inherit be real mess we be in situation where our constituent face bill from the dwp landing on their doorstep the current carer allowance system be cruel with punitive cliff edge that force unpaid carer to choose between earn basic income or care for their love one it mean that if carer go over the earning allowance by or indeed by as we have hear in number of speech they be force to pay back the full amount that they receive which could be figure in the thousand instead of system that understand the need for flexibility give the nature of be carer and the reality of try to fit pay work around that often with zero hour contract and earning that change from week to week the system penalise carer and threaten they with criminal prosecution it be just another broken system leave by the previous government that this government have to sort out and another part of the foundation of our country that we will fix to rebuild britain as stand to speak on this important topic think of the carer in my constituency vital work will now progress and hopefully it will be conclude swiftly by the government so that carer never have to choose between earn proper income and care for love one the secretary of state for work and pensions be on the radio this morning and listen to she on the bbc describe how the benefit system can have real impact on whether you incentivise or disincentivise work hear from she that this new government intend to incentivise work and in that we wish they well wish to highlight the case of constituent of mine amanda jennings from ottery st mary who reach out to plead for support she be mother and full time carer for her adult son who have severe autism amanda be recently notify by the department for work and pensions that she owe almost date back to due to carer allowance overpayment to compound that stress civil penalty be impose her problem be that she have be receive wage slip give an hourly rate and the payment be process by an external payroll agent so she do not have reliable monthly income like we do despite raise query and assume that the dwp be receive up to date information she be accuse wrongly of misreporte her income the consequence for her family have be severe her son who have re enter education after year of disengagement have drop out and her own health have deteriorate she be not alone more than people nationally face similar financial penalty for minor income discrepancy the liberal democrat stance be plain carer should not be punish for minor unintentional breach of income threshold the current system be rigid and punitive with cliff edge that do nothing at all to incentivise work early hear the former secretary of state talk about the business of clawback and whether it could be do retrospectively look to the past perhaps he need to be remind that with the furlough scheme the previous government fail to claw back million and million of pound indeed the public accounts committee reckon billion that be incorrectly pay to employer whose employee continue to work while they be receive furlough money it be just like the former government to go after the people at the bottom of the pile who be most in need when it be the people who have be describe today who most need the support hope that the government will make the most of the independent inquiry that be glad they have set up and ensure that any change incentivise work and make work pay this have be an extraordinarily interesting debate pay tribute to everybody who have speak and thank the would be official opposition for have secure it in my constituency of chelsea and fulham we have nearly unpaid carer quarter of whom provide more than hour of care week know many of they and know what vital tough job they do for their love one as well as the value that carer bring to this country economy many speaker have touch on that also know that carer deserve to be treat with kindness but instead have be treat with cruelty my hon friend the member for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis touch on the local cruelty that he have experience from his conservative council but nationally through mixture of official incompetence and political indifference carer have be treat cruelly let we be clear the department for work and pensions cock up here and cock up badly when carer tell official deal with universal credit that they breach earning limit official do not necessarily pass that on to those official deal with carer allowance when carer allowance official be alert to breach they do not act in many case for month they do not look at their email so payment be allow to build up as have be remark on to as much as then the department for work and pensions swoop in threaten prosecution and penalty and in many case do not listen to perfectly reasonable explanation it bring in technical solution that fail to sort the problem out why because it be woefully under resource those at the top of the department for work and pensions have never properly apologise for the cruel system that they allow to be maintain for so long why do they not do that it be simple they take their cue as people in the civil service do from those above they from their political master the ministers the shadow secretary of state be ask by the would be leader of the opposition whether he have ever ask official how much overpayment be fraudulent from his response suspect it be question that he never ask why do he not ask that and why do he fail to publish the dwp report from on the overpayment crisis until just before the election suspect the answer be that he be more interested in cover up than in find out what be go on and sort out the problem be delighted that the labour government be now sort this out the review be start as many member have say there be much more to be do to support unpaid carer but they will no long be hang out to dry by cruel incompetent indifferent government and that have to be good thing there be many honour in this role and one be to be able to take part in important debate such as this and hear the expertise and passion of hon member across the house will start by pay tribute to the many carer who do incredible work in my constituency at time of immense need they step in day after day support family member and make such an important contribution to those they love and to our community our country simply would not function without they and their contribution and wish to share my immense gratitude to those carer from my area and beyond their selflessness and dedication make this scandal all the more unfair with carer push to breaking point and stress pile on stress sadly like too many issue this crisis be totally ignore and leave to grow by the previous government at wirral carer week early this year meet carer who have be impact by this issue and know the anxiety it have bring they as they have have to juggle their caring responsibility with the uncertainty it have bring stability be long overdue carer need to know that lesson will be learn and that the mistake of the past will not be repeat welcome the secretary of state announcement that she will launch the independent review into carer allowance overpayment lead by the disability right expert liz sayce we all wish she well with that important review also welcome the announcement by the minister for employment of the launch of pilot to support carer far with these step truly hope that carer feel value and listen to that the issue they feel be important be bring to light and that there be support for they welcome today announcement and hope that with it our brilliant carer know that this government be on their side we get everybody in who want to participate so well do we now come to the front benchers call the liberal democrat spokesperson start by congratulate those hon member who make their maiden speech this afternoon the hon member for clwyd north gill german give brilliant description of her time teaching and the inspiration she provide to her pupil as someone who grow up in gloucestershire say to the hon member for weston super mare dan aldridge that his town be our destination of choice for seaside day out my hon friend the member for torbay steve darling represent another seaside town and he and the honourable jennie be both dear to the liberal democrat group pay tribute to the work of my hon friend the member for north east fife wendy chamberlain in bring forward her private member bill in the last parliament on unpaid carer leave we be truly proud of her achievement in bring that into law as the carer leave act also thank my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey for all his work on care and carer and for bring this debate to the house today the carer allowance scandal have be overlook for year it be astonishing that it have take liberal democrat opposition day for this critical topic to finally receive the attention it deserve the fact that we have have to bring this debate today late in after change of government and five year after mps look into the carer allowance scandal and conclude that there be no evidence of mass fraud be shameful and stain on the legacy of the previous conservative government the conservatives fail to take the action need the conservatives fail to tackle the cultural problem at the dwp the conservatives fail to care about carer today member from across the house have give voice to unpaid family carer whom we should be thank rather than punish we have hear about how the dwp action leave people feel insult bully harass and crush that be not right we should be lift up these people we should be thank they not hound they for the love and care they give to their love one the population of my mid sussex constituency be old than the average across the country the population be age we can not shy away from the fact that we will as society increasingly rely on carer just because care often happen in home in private and behind closed door that do not mean that it be not important or that we can ignore it welcome the government announcement on commission an open and transparent report to review the carer allowance overpayment but question remain will the minister stop the shameful attempt to recoup overpayment will there be an amnesty on pursue past overpayment will they consider taper carer allowance will they consult on whether hour of care week be the right threshold for claim carer allowance how will they set about change the culture of the dwp so that people never feel like criminal simply for care for their love one while try to work to pay the bill it be disappointing that the government be seek to amend our motion to delete what carer be cry out for after year of conservative neglect we can not afford yet more dither and delay as my hon friend the member for chichester jess brown fuller say unpaid carer save the taxpayer an astonishing billion year the government financial worry would stretch far beyond the current billion black hole be it not for those unsung hero that be not just statistic it represent profound debt of gratitude that we owe to those who provide care the social emotional and financial value that unpaid carer bring to our community can not be overstate this afternoon member from all part of the house have make that point loud and clear carer be not just caregiver they be lifeline give support that our healthcare system would struggle to replace there be however danger in view care as merely transactional care be far more than just fulfil basic physical need it be about enable individual to achieve their potential and live fulfilling life live that they deserve to enjoy family carer support love one in way that help they thrive not just survive close by thank the government for their response today and for engage so constructively in this debate thank the charity that advocate for carer for the vital work they do most importantly thank the million unpaid carer across the country for all that they do day in day out with love and compassion they be the very good of we we see what carer do we hear what carer be say and and my liberal democrat colleague will continue to speak up for they in this place call the minister be pleased to be able to respond to this vital debate which in both tone and importance have be one of the good have hear in my two year in this place also add my thank to the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey for bring forward the opposition day motion today because this issue be clearly of concern to many member and they be right to be concern the right hon member be one of many right hon and hon member to have make important contribution and speak with great passion on this crucial issue the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey and for carshalton and wallington bobby dean my hon friend the member for hertford and stortford josh dean the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins my hon friend the members for wirral west matthew patrick for harlow chris vince and for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter the hon member for stratford on avon manuela perteghella and for maidenhead mr reynolds and other rightly speak about the important role that million of family carer play in provide support for disabled or elderly relative who need care at home echo those comment and add my own tribute to all family carer much of their tireless work go unseen and unrecognised like other member be privileged to witness glimpse of carer dedication through my correspondence and through event attend in my constituency run through today debate be an underlying and understandable anger at the position we inherit from the last government whereby family carer try to do the right thing have be leave with staggering overpayment often run into thousand of pound as my hon friend the member for birkenhead alison mcgovern set out early we be make sure that we understand precisely what have go wrong so that we can put the system right for the long term our family carer deserve no less many member include the hon member for eastleigh liz jarvis and for north east fife wendy chamberlain my hon friend the members for shipley anna dixon and for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis and the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone and of course my hon friend the member for city of durham mary kelly foy and the right hon member for kingston and surbiton speak about their own experience as carer or the work they do locally to support organisation help family carer grow up watch my grandmother care for my grandad struggle with parkinson disease before later see my mum one of the many hidden carer up and down the land care for her mother my nana in her final year battle alzheimer disease none of we in this house be blind to the work that carer do they be fortunate to have some wonderful advocate those include their mp as we have see today but also organisation such as carers uk the carers trust and the learning and work institute to name but three the minister for social security and disability my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms and have already meet delegation of carer and carers uk and he will be do so again shortly he will also meet separately with the carers trust and the learning and work institute because we be determined to ensure that the voice of family carer and the organisation support they be at the heart of everything we do also want to pay tribute to the hundred of dwp staff largely base in the north west who provide financial support to million family carer through carer allowance day in day out the government will spend record amount to support unpaid carer real term expenditure on carer allowance be forecast to rise from billion in to just over billion year by turn to some of the other point raise during the debate with apology that time will permit to address only some of they let take the opportunity to congratulate and pay tribute to my hon friend the members for clwyd north gill german and for weston super mare dan aldridge and the hon member for torbay steve darling on their excellent maiden speech they paint vivid picture of their constituency and feel certain that they will go on to make significant contribution in this place on the wide point will begin with the question of the adequacy of carer allowance set as it be at per week carer allowance will be increase in april by the consumer price index to help ensure that it maintain its value as well as carer allowance carer in low income household can claim income relate benefit such as universal credit and pension report october vol correction those can be pay to carer at high rate than to those without care responsibility through the carer element and the additional amount for carer respectively for example over carer household on universal credit can already receive an additional year through the carer element that say the house should be aware that issue beyond the scope of the independent review announce today be not be ignore this be merely first step towards progress the government be also look at the broad question of how to provide the good possible support for family carer although do not want to pre empt that work today let turn to the question of taper which be raise by number of right hon and hon member at the moment introduce taper in carer allowance would significantly complicate the benefit with award have to be adjust manually on weekly basis for some of those declare earning that would add to administrative cost and could mean more fraud and error those also receive universal credit would need to have that adjust if their payment of carer allowance change because of an earning taper rate taper could be introduce only follow significant change to the it system that support payment of carer allowance for the moment therefore it be not possible on the potential writing off of overpayment which be at the heart of many of the excellent contribution that we hear an overpayment can occur through fraud or through claimant or official error the secretary of state have an obligation to protect public fund and ensure that wherever possible overpayment be recover but determine what good we can do to support those who have accrue overpayment be within the scope of the independent review as be how such overpayment occur and what we can do to ensure that we take all the step we can to reduce the risk of such incident happen again let turn briefly to the comment of the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for central devon mel stride he list the many intervention that the last government supposedly make to improve the lot of carer seemingly include the private member bill of the hon member for north east fife but after year of conservative government we see carer who find themselves in heartbreaking situation have rack up huge overpayment however the right hon gentleman correctly set out the incredibly complex nature of the carer allowance system with allowance for legitimate expense pension contribution and so on and why resolve this matter be therefore not straightforward that be why the independent review be the correct mechanism and next step to fully understand what go wrong and why and how we can put thing right welcome his support for the review many colleague refer to the role that family carer play in ease pressure on the social care system and indeed in support our economy and they be entirely right to do so acknowledge everything that carer do they be hero we appreciate how much society rely on unpaid carer we recognise the challenge they face and we understand the need for change support carer be both moral and an economic imperative so we will help carer stay in pay work we be spend record amount on carer allowance and we will sort out the overpayment scandal we inherit that be why we have announce the independent review today so that together we can rebuild the trust that have be lose and ensure that those who offer comfort dignity and support to the one they love be give all the help they need in return hope right hon and hon member will acknowledge that work today by support the government amendment question

add question agree to main question as amend put and agree to resolve that this house recognise the remarkable contribution that the uk million unpaid carer make to society believe it be essential that carer be provide with the support they need at the time they need it condemn the previous government for fail to address the scandal of demand for repayment of carer allowance and welcome the government review into how these overpayment have occur what good can be do to support those who have accrue they and how to reduce the risk of these problem occur in future access to primary healthcare inform the house that have select amendment table in the name of the prime minister call helen morgan beg to move that this house regret that the nhs have be plunge into crisis by year of neglect by the previous government leave far too many people wait week to see gp or unable to find an nhs dentist and child and adult waiting month or even year to receive the mental health care they need believe that everyone should be able to access high quality primary care service when they need they and where they need they condemn the previous government for preside over fall in the number of full time equivalent fully qualified gps and nhs dentist in the last parliament far regret that the government have not yet set out plan to invest in primary care at the level need to meet demand call on the government to boost access to gps nhs dentist and community pharmacist and far call on the government to give everyone the right to see gp within seven day or within hour if they urgently need to and to guarantee access to an nhs dentist for everyone need urgent and emergency care it be real honour to open this debate on the liberal democrats first opposition day for year primary care be the front door to the health service but for too many people at the moment that door be close whether they be wake up and deal with the am call frenzy to get gp appointment frantically ring every dental practice in their area for an nhs dentist or turn up at their local pharmacy to pick up prescription for their love one or themselves and find it unexpectedly close or the medicine out of stock primary care be in terrible trouble and it need fix urgently that be not only to make life well for the people who be suffer because they can not access the primary care they need but to allow the nhs to function more efficiently accident and emergency be not decent substitute door to the nhs be an asthmatic and as young person have quite serious asthma can remember when primary care be absolutely there for in the middle of the night on lot of occasion when need help my dad do not have to take to the hospital in an ambulance somebody come to with nebuliser and get sort out within couple of hour and then we all go back to bed now that be not an option for lot of people the nhs be in crisis and that be cause pain and suffering unnecessarily the crisis be also cost far more than we can afford it be costly because early intervention and deal with people in their community or at their home be so much more efficient than take somebody to hospital even if that be in private car and it be costly because it cause people genuine pain the bbc report that in oswestry in my constituency this year man remove his molar with pair of plier because he could not find an nhs dentist but it be also costly because people be unable to access work and that be cost the economy polling commission by the liberal democrats show that one in four people have be unable to go to work while wait for primary care appointment that be not good for an economy that urgently need to grow we need urgent investment in primary care in doctor dentist and community pharmacist to save people from have to go to hospital on pharmacy new report from healthwatch england reveal worrying picture of pharmacy closure and reduce hour hit old people and rural community the hard nhs norfolk and waveney integrate care board which cover much of my constituency have report the high number of hour lose per pharmacy do the hon lady agree that we urgently need national evaluation of pharmacy funding include the size role mix and distribution of the pharmacy workforce that be an important point in my constituency carer who go to pick up prescription medicine be find that the pharmacist be not there because they be rely on locum the pharmacy funding problem need to be address as matter of urgency and will say more about that later grow the economy be so important that we need to get people off the waiting and referral list and back into work liberal democrats believe that people should be in control of their own life not chain up at home unable to get out of bed because they have no access to healthcare they should be able to get the help that they need when they need it in their own home and community let we start with gps the liberal democrat manifesto it be well receive which be why there be so many member sit behind on these benches call for the right to see gp within seven day or hour if the situation be urgent and for those aged over or with chronic health condition to have access to name gp those right be extremely important people who go to the same gp for more than year have low chance of die than those who have see new gp in the last year primary care network tell that their inability to deliver continuity of care because of the shortage of gps be one of the problem that worry they most my hon friend be make brilliant introductory speech be she aware that perhaps only third of those leave medical school and seek to go into general practice be able to find job partly because the additional role reimbursement scheme which do exist can not be extend to enable some of those would be gps to be recruit be it not mad that although we be create enough potential gps through medical school we can not give they job because of the funding mechanism that this government inherit from the last one we be lose they from general practice and in some instance lose they from the country altogether my hon friend be entirely right believe that the government be take step to address that but he have make an important point about the need for flexible gp funding general practice may have money to spend on professional and need more fully qualified doctor to deal with its patient list but can only spend that money on another pharmacist or another nurse that be ridiculous situation and be pleased that the government be deal with it will the hon lady give way no will make some progress people do much well if they have access to continuity of care but more gps be need to deliver the right that we lay out in our manifesto we do not shy away from the fact that that be an ambitious objective and we accept that it can not be achieve through training and recruitment alone we need to retain and incentivise our exist workforce as say early see people in their community avoid hospital admission and save money unfortunately although the conservatives promise we more gps in we end up with few that be why people be so frustrated accord to the finding of research carry out by the house of commons library gp funding have fall by million in real term since as result not only be people struggle to gain access to basic care in their community but there be postcode lottery when it come to availability of that care in the area where live which be cover by nhs shropshire telford and wrekin the number of fully qualified gps fall from in to in despite an increase and increasingly age population with much high level of demand while of patient be wait more than day for non urgent appointment the darzi report show that the number of people wait for long period for appointment be rise throughout the country it be national issue we know that from our own doorstep conversation member might ask where be you go to get more gps from that be big number apart from train new one we should value greatly our experienced one recruitment and training programme be one idea and as my hon friend the member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron point out use the dentist we have train properly be extremely important but we also need to focus on retention and incentivise our exist gps to ensure that we hold on to valuable experience and valuable patient continuity let move on from gps to local pharmacy pharmacy first be great idea of the previous government be willing to give they credit but pharmacist be under huge strain accord to the darzi report some have close since and spend under the community contract have fall tomorrow be go to visit green end pharmacy in whitchurch in my constituency which write to as an independent pharmacy we unable to keep on absorb cost with loss on dispense the pharmacy be struggle because it be make loss on the drug that it give out on prescription give that it be small independent pharmacy it do not have massive shop from which to make profit to subside that work in community pharmacy england warn of systemic pharmacy funding cut of at least in real term since that have lead to postcode lottery of access and to many pharmacy be unable to have full time pharmacist and rely on locum which have lead to really poor and insecure level of service that be impact on people who just need to go and pick up their prescription and get on with their day the nhs be devolve in scotland but the uk government have responsibility for continuity of supply of medication have constituent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who have be wait for up to year to secure that continuity of supply do my hon friend agree that we need to see more action from the government who should be proactive in that regard that be really important point lot of people in my constituency have contact for help with drug for example to deal with adhd people need to be able to access important medication readily we must not forget the dentistry element of primary care generation of child be at risk of poor oral health because of the mess in which dentistry have be leave by the previous government tooth decay be the big cause of child be admit to hospital with over admit since that be totally unacceptable some million child have not be see by an nhs dentist in the last year accord to the house of commons library dentistry be really important for child they have to keep their tooth for the rest of their life but this issue affect adult too my constituent ron kelly who be be disabled and live in market drayton member who have be around while might know that it be not easy to catch bus to anywhere from market drayton he have not be able to find dentist since and my caseworker have ring every nhs dentist in our constituency none of they be take on new patient so even if he be able to use the bus he would not be able to find an nhs dentist in north shropshire at the moment office for national statistics datum release last week show that in the midland of people who do not have an nhs dentist and who be try to find an appointment can not access it be just unbelievable in modern country in the century my hon friend mention the challenge that many of our constituent face when try to get access to nhs dentistry be think about some of my own constituent who have talk to and indeed show their home dentistry result hon member urgh yes do my hon friend agree that we should learn from good practice that be take place across the country my hazel grove constituent be struggle to find dentist but because of some reallocation of exist funding in greater manchester new appointment have be make available do she agree that we should look at good practice to learn what can be deliver elsewhere across the country flexibility of contracting be critical and learn from good practice elsewhere in the country will help to address the problem want to highlight how silly it be that people can not find an nhs dentist when they need one because nhs dental funding be actually go unspent in shropshire telford and wrekin the area know about million be claw back in because dentist be unable to spend the money allocate to they they do not have enough staff to work the contract with they meet someone last year who have not have day off work we be in october by that point and he have to hand back his contract the government have propose golden handshake but have hear on the ground that they do not work certainly in shropshire we need reform contract flexible commissioning proper statutory requirement for workforce planning and the ability for dentist to use their funding to manage their own practice in way that allow they to make bit of money out of treat patient on the nhs also want to highlight the public health grant cut by the conservatives and how important it be to reverse they be it be complete false economy to cut programme that help with oral health and prevent poor tooth and future dental problem when we could spend the money up front so that it would cost far less in the future will the hon lady give way will make some progress now if that be okay because be conscious that lot of people want to get in and make full speech we have call for guarantee for urgent and emergency dental care check up for those people who be already eligible and those need check up before thing such as chemotherapy and surgery be also in our manifesto it be only go to be possible to offer those guarantee if we deal with the issue in the dental contract and the flexibility of commission primary care be the front door to the nhs as mention at the beginning and lord darzi point out in his report that that be where we should be invest at the moment money be flow to secondary care to hospital yet most people experience of the nhs be with their doctor or dentist we must ensure that that first point of call be good point of call and reduce the number of people go to that be so much more cost effective but it be also so much well for those people who could manage their health condition without crisis and without ever have to go near hospital we should also think of the knock on impact on those hospital we all have horror story of ambulance queue up outside hospital because so many people be in and so few people can flow through the hospital the issue around that be complex and they link in to social care as well but the reality be that if we can treat people in the community we will save the life of people who need emergency care this be absolutely fundamental we need investment in our gps and in dental and pharmacy contract because we can not afford not to do it in addition to pharmacist and dentist would like to mention my profession optometrist can really play role in reduce the strain on primary and secondary care thank the hon gentleman for his intervention that be an important point and apologise for not make it in my speech optometry be really important and as somebody who spend their whole life look for their other glass can absolutely appreciate his point should ve go to specsavers laughter other optician be available other optician be available but do the liberal democrat manifesto suggest solution to these problem and they have be well receive as mention before we have record number of mps and that be because we put this issue front and centre of our election pledge urge the government to reverse the catastrophic state that the nhs have be leave in by the conservatives to take our idea on board and to invest in primary care as soon as possible rise order before call the minister must respectfully point out that huge number of members wish to speak and that intervention from member will only eat up the time available to colleague and in some instance themselves call the minister karin smyth to move the amendment beg to move an amendment to leave out from parliament to the end of the question and add welcome the urgency with which the new government commission lord darzi to conduct an independent investigation of the nhs in england recognise that within week of take office the government invest million to recruit newly qualified gps note the government commitment to tackle the dental crisis by provide urgent dental appointment and recruit new dentist to the area that need they approve the government commitment to expand the role of pharmacy and well utilise the skill of pharmacist and pharmacy technician and welcome the government commitment to far reduce unnecessary bureaucracy as care shift from hospital to community recognise that many people want to speak so will be as brief as possible begin by thank the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan for start this debate think she speak for we all when she say that she spend lot of time look for her glass recently decide to go for the varifocal option just to avoid that problem she also speak for we all when she say that we all know how great it be when primary care be there for we be proud to have work with primary care across the piece in south bristol for many year although the hon lady and be on opposite side of the chamber think we can agree that the last government break primary care at the same time as they be break the nhs throughout my time in opposition and in my first three month in government simply have not meet or speak to gp pharmacist dentist or indeed anyone else work in primary care who have say everything be go swimmingly my patient be happy and this be exactly what sign up for lord darzi review tell the same story and set out an enormous charge sheet and we still have not hear whether the conservative party agree or indeed whether it will apologise the list be far too long to repeat in full hospital workforce and budget have shoot up yet full time equivalent gp number have be allow to shrink by over over the last seven year promise to shift resource to the community have be repeatedly break and our primary care estate be not fit for purpose shockingly one in five general practice building be old than the nhs itself the minister may be aware that lobby health and treasury ministers in the previous government for the good part of year and half to review outdated treasury rule that prevent gp practice that want to move from stay within city centre the outdated rule force they to move to ring road location away from the population they serve will the minister look at this issue with fresh eye with her new glass and work with treasury colleague to review these outdated rule thank the hon lady for her assiduous work in opposition look at the capital estate be one of my favourite new responsibility and our commitment to neighbourhood service mean that we need to bring service together we need to look at this across the piece to make sure that primary care be provide where it be need we often hear about hard to reach group but do not think they be that hard to reach frankly service be sometimes locate in the wrong area one of our key commitment be to shift service into community and the neighbourhood service programme be part of that just three in nhs dentist be accept new adult patient and geographical inequality be vast more than pharmacy have shut their door for good since again the record speak for itself public satisfaction with general practice have fall from in to just last year if there be any reason why the conservative benches be empty it be because dissatisfaction with access to primary care be so stark as we learn in july general election it be absolutely clear that primary care be break but nhs staff work in primary care do not break it the last government do they cut funding for the community pharmacy contract they fail to incentivise enough dentist to perform nhs work and they pursue disastrous top down reorganisation of the nhs with which we be still live the last government might have break the nhs but it be not beat nhs staff remain as passionate dedicated and skilful as ever and this government will work in lockstep with they their counterpart in social care and local partner across the country to fix the nhs will the minister give way be tempt but know that many of the hon lady colleague want to speak and be sure she be on the list fix the nhs will take year of discipline and hard work and we be in this for the long haul however we must first clean up the mess we inherit and that work have begin in earnest we have find the funding to recruit an extra gps this year as our first step towards fix the nhs front door and make the system more flexible will the minister give way yes as that will be one from each side of the aisle one of the key to delivery be the gp partnership model which be the mechanism by which they be set up the secretary of state who be now in his place say in that he want to phase out the gp partnership model although he later renege on that position it would be interesting to hear what the government now perceive to be the good model for deliver primary care as that be really important for gp partner wish the hon gentleman well with his own access to gp at the moment we be commit to work with the profession on the good way to organise primary care the critical point be that primary care however it be organise in neighbourhood be there for our constituent when they need it it be not there now the model be not work and have not work over period of time it have merit as we have say and we be continue to talk to people have work in the sector for number of year so understand the point the hon gentleman make on that point will the minister give way no want to move on will take one more intervention from the government benches at some point and then it be all fair but want to allow time for hon member to speak in our first week we pledge to increase the proportion of nhs resource go into primary care and in our first month the government make down payment on that pledge provide gp practice with their big funding increase in year but we be not just increase funding we be also cut the red tape that stop many staff do their job some gp practice currently have to fill in more than different form to refer patient into secondary care service they be spend as much as of their time on work create by poor communication with their secondary care colleague that be totally nonsensical in and it have to change time spend do needless paperwork and bureaucracy mean appointment lose for patient which be why we have launch red tape challenge to bulldoze bureaucracy and free up gps to deliver more appointment it will be lead by claire fuller and stella vig establish leader in primary and secondary care they will check with staff what be work well and what need to change so we can take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs initiative like consultant connect in south london allow gps to talk to mental health consultant in real time reduce the number of referral they have to make by deliver across the country such scheme could save thousand of hour of time and create thousand of new appointment that be what our red tape challenge be all about we want to help patient see specialist fast start in november online will pilot directly refer woman with worrying lump to breast clinic that mean fast diagnosis for cancer patient and more gp appointment free up which be well for patient and well for gps on dentistry as the hon member for north shropshire outline we inherit an nhs dentistry system in disrepair thank to year of chaos failure and neglect as we have to keep remind conservative members it be national scandal that tooth decay be the lead cause of hospital admission for five to nine year old we all see that in our constituency the last government break their relationship with the british dental association as they break so many relationship during the election campaign we pledge to meet the bda immediately upon take office to start rebuild the relationship and that be exactly what we do the bda be right that the last government dentistry recovery plan do not go far enough we be keep part of it that be the right solution include the golden hello and some other measure but we want to go far to deliver an nhs rescue plan that get dentistry back on its foot we be work around the clock to end the truly dickensian tooth decay that be blight our child as well as our additional urgent appointment for all age we will work with local authority to introduce supervised tooth brushing for three to five year old in our most deprived community we will see the difference get they into healthy habit can make protect their tooth from decay and end the national scandal the last government preside over on pharmacy previous government dither and delay fail to find sustainable and long term funding solution nhs england be work with the sector to assess the cost of provide pharmaceutical service and we look forward to see its outcome consultation around this year funding and contractual arrangement with community pharmacy england do not make it over the line before the election be call so we be look at that as matter of urgency we want to continue to make it easy for pharmacist to take referral and support people with common condition use prescribing skill to treat wide range of condition and patient pharmacist be highly skilled people in our community allow patient to get the care they need in the community save time and free up gp appointment by use the skill of pharmacist will be really helpful for the wide system those be our first step primary care be central to the three big shift that underpin our ten year plan to make the nhs fit for the future take it from analogue to digital from sickness to prevention and from hospital to community we will soon begin public consultation that will be the big listening exercise in nhs history look forward to take part in that and urge all right hon and hon member their constituent and staff across primary care to tell we what be work and what need to change we will use their response to take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs and build neighbourhood health service technology will help doctor dentist and pharmacist meet demand for same day appointment give patient digital front door to end the am scramble big datum will end the cruel postcode lottery of health inequality so that we can take screening check and care directly to the community that need it most intervene early to prevent ill health and deterioration we want colleague from across primary care to come together with their partner in social care and mental health to work in lockstep as one team to treat patient in the comfort of their own home which be where those patient want to be that be the neighbourhood health service that we want to build that be the future that our constituent want to see in the interest of time madam deputy speaker will conclude our constituent be let down by the previous government they be let down by broken promise underfunding and failure to listen to patient and staff we will repair the damage we have already begin invest in gps and pharmacy to fix what be break we will cut the red tape speed up treatment and build neighbourhood health service that work for everyone the nhs may be break but it be not beat we be determined to rebuild it for our people our community and our country as doctor myself wish to start by recognise the substantial work ethic and expertise of my primary care colleague and thank they for all that they do say what be wrong with the nhs be very easy solve problem take much long and be far more difficult rather than the next few hour be fill with constructive idea expect that we will simply hear complaint about the challenge face by the nhs perhaps some party political jibe and wish list of promise and the thing that people want to see but no concrete plan on how to deliver they beyond more money hope that be wrong about that but suspect that be not our nhs be face significant challenge we have an age population with more complex health need rise demand for service and rapidly grow population we also have the legacy from the pandemic which many be quick to forget although we be the first country to deliver vaccine there be many persistent problem stem from the pandemic let give the house an example before the pandemic in there be woman who have be wait more than year to see gynaecologist but due to the reduction in elective activity during the lockdown by the time the pandemic be over that number be more than this be of course replicate across other medical specialty although my secondary care colleague have be work extremely hard to reduce those number and indeed they have fall the individual concern will on average visit their gps more while they be wait and that inevitably put more pressure on primary care service the simple truth be that we give the nhs more money than it have ever have and as result it have deliver more clinical activity than ever before but the age population the rise demand for service and the legacy of the pandemic have mean that in place that have not be enough many people be not be see as quickly as we would want they to be the previous labour administration do not do enough to train new doctor and the reality be that we can not train one overnight the conservative government build five new medical school and the graduate of those medical school have recently start work the secretary of state say that he will double the number of medical student that be an item on his wish list with which agree but do have few question will he build new medical school expand the old one or do both if he be go to build new one where will he build they interruption the minister for secondary care be talk about primary care believe that doctor be part of primary care the ucas deadline to apply for most medical school place to start next autumn be yesterday so when do the secretary of state expect these new place to be available and those new student to start on the broad primary care workforce we expand the number of primary care professional in gp practice such as dietitian and physiotherapist and we deliver million more gp appointment last year than in we also see the launch of pharmacy first which deliver more care in the community while ease pressure on gp appointment be pleased to hear the liberal democrat spokesman acknowledge the success and the benefit of that programme have few question for the secretary of state the conservatives produce the first nhs workforce plan can the right hon gentleman say whether he will proceed with those plan or write new one what be the timescale for his plan in the spring budget we have the nhs productivity plan with billion to improve nhs productivity do the right hon gentleman still intend to follow that the minister for secondary care say that she be recruit gps can the secretary of state tell we how many have be recruit so far the secretary of state and also agree on the ability of technology to improve nhs service as new member be learn how this place work so be interested to see how much you expect the labour government to have achieve in day why be it after year that you leave the country with the long waiting list ever and small child have to get their rotten tooth see at what can you say that be helpful to we in understand why the failure of year of conservatism take place and do you feel any remorse about that order before call on the shadow minister to return to the dispatch box apologise madam deputy speaker use the word you instead of the hon member yes several time it be not have never be health minister reiterate that intervention will have to be short will be impose time limit as we have to hear from an enormous number of member this afternoon thank the hon gentleman for his intervention have talk about the challenge the nhs face will come shortly to the achievement of the labour government so far in the department of health and social care turn back to technology be say that agree with the secretary of state on how technology can improve nhs service over the last few year in my professional capacity have see improvement in make communication between primary and secondary care and within secondary care much more efficient as patient have use the askmygp service which be an excellent way to communicate with gp particularly for work people have also use the nhs app which million of people have download and which have huge potential hope he intend to build on that potential and harness the benefit of ai for diagnostic in particular the secretary of state and also agree on the importance of prevention it be vital to make the nhs accessible to those who need it but it be even well if people stay healthy in the first place before the election he be supportive of measure to protect child from the danger of vaping measure campaign for actively in fact he be quite critical that it have not be do soon as in some respect be give that the legislation have already be write and that it pass both second reading and committee stage with the support of his friend on the labour benches why be it take he so long to produce tobacco and vape bill can he guarantee that he will deliver it like present in time for christmas for clarity be hop for this christmas have you be naughty or nice have be good girl thank you secretary of state furthermore can the secretary of state explain how cancel dozen of new hospital will reduce pressure on general practice can he explain how cut the winter fuel payment for million of pensioner will help the nhs the end fuel poverty coalition predict that labour winter fuel payment cut will result in an additional pensioner need nhs treatment because they be cold result in great deal of suffering and million of pound of additional cost to the nhs do he agree with that assessment have ask repeatedly in both oral and write question if the government will conduct proper impact assessment of the policy on the nhs and on the wellbeing of vulnerable old people will he commit to produce and publish such as report far on the issue of prevention the right hon gentleman will know that folic acid supplementation can prevent neural tube disorder such as spina bifida and anencephaly the previous government bring forward regulation on the matter what conversation have the secretary of state have with the department for environment food and rural affairs about ensure that that work be continue our approach to dentistry be also underline by prevention we introduce the health and care act which give the secretary of state the power to introduce water fluoridation scheme those power have since be use to extend exist scheme particularly in the north east of england do the secretary of state intend to continue that work and exercise the power the previous government give he he know that be passionate about dentistry have raise the issue many time in the house include by secure an adjournment debate on dentistry in lincolnshire it trouble greatly that child be come to hospital for multiple dental extraction due to rotten tooth it be worth note that the issue be not shortage of dentist overall or as the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan say shortage of money but shortage of dentist do nhs work rather than private work specifically the previous government be encourage dentist to take up nhs work with range of measure include golden hello for dentist in underserved area dental van go out to rural community and tie in for new dental graduate we be also in the process of broad contract reform after small change in the unit of dental activity rate when we go into the election let we look at labour run wales in comparison wales be deliver only of pre pandemic dental activity it be burden with the high proportion of nhs dental practice not accept adult patient and the long waiting list in the uk one in four welsh resident be currently on waiting list the new secretary of state for wales have say that the government will take inspiration from labour run wales on dentistry give their woeful record in office sincerely hope that that be not the case before the election when listen to the secretary of state for health and social care say that labour have plan to reform and modernise the nhs believe he but in monday debate on the lord darzi report we uncover that his plan be not really plan at all but list of desire outcome and proposal to make plan if he get into office it be unclear how long this plan will take to develop the minister for secondary care say that it be listen exercise like we have never see before but how much will that cost and have labour not be listen already why do the previous government shift funding from secondary care to primary care despite say that they would do the exact opposite essentially because there be more clinical acute need in primary care hospital give the choice with one amount of money between save life and prevent problem for later it be inevitable that money get shift towards acute care that be where the pressure be but agree with the hon gentleman that we need to work hard to prevent people from become ill in the first place on that point will the shadow minister give way no will not give way again because know that you will give eye if do madam deputy speaker labour have spend year in opposition the secretary of state have have plenty of time to consider what he would do if he gain office so far to the intervention of the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman what have the government achieve in week to help the health of the nation will tell you madam deputy speaker they have open the department door to their labour mate they have award an inflation bust pay rise to junior doctor without negotiate any modernisation or productivity reform in return they have oversee gps enter industrial action and nurse reject their pay offer they have scrap the social care cost cap they have produce report of select statistic with no policy recommendation they have break their manifesto pledge to deliver the new hospital programme they have take the winter fuel payment from million of vulnerable pensioner they have even stop the child cancer taskforce that dire record underline by the labour legacy in wales fill with huge trepidation for the future of the nhs hope that when the government plan eventually come it be good one for all our sake hear from many constituent in aylesbury who be struggle to see their gp for some this be frustration repeat one for other it be tragedy sit with constituent who share heartbreaking story about miss cancer diagnosis because it be impossible to get an appointment the reason for the challenge be clear as the minister set out in aylesbury two additional factor be create particular pressure first many new housing development have be build in the last year without the necessary service to accompany they for example the promise gp surgery in kingsbrook that be never build add pressure to other surgery such as poplar grove secondly there be high level of deprivation in part of aylesbury the well document link between poverty and ill health lead to patient have increase and complex physical and mental health need that gp surgery be not fund or equip to meet let we be clear about the cause of these challenge which be not the fault of patient who like all of we be just try to stay in good health or of gps who often work incredibly long hour in system that let they down and wear they down the problem be the broken system that this labour government have inherit after year of conservative government let turn to the solution the early step that we have take be clear signal of our intent the ending of the junior doctor strike the red tape challenge that the secretary of state launch with nhs england and the measure that we take within week of be elect include find million of additional funding to enable the immediate recruitment of more gps know from the gps be in touch with that that have make real difference there be still much work to do will highlight three area of necessary focus first we must expand the range of care available in the community gp surgery waste time refer patient to hospital lead community service when they know that they could treat those patient directly but do not have the funding or permission to do so meanwhile patient tell that they have have to go to for minor issue because there be no support close to home our ambition for an expand range of support and service through neighbourhood health centre be absolutely right and we be get straight to work on that secondly on technology hear time and again of gps spend hour try to make referral to and from the hospital battle it system that be not intuitive and do not speak to each other meanwhile patient tell that they can not fathom why there be not well system for book appointment there be great pilot scheme that could be roll out more widely at the gp surgery in edlesborough in my constituency for example carefully design ai chatbot answer patient question where it can and help gps to prioritise which patient to see thirdly we need firm emphasis on prevention in public health by drive up public awareness of health risk on recent visit to the main mosque in aylesbury for example see stand with information about diabete that be exactly the right way to get the right information in front of people once public health risk be identify we must empower patient to manage their own health as good they can as vernon sharples mental health nurse in my constituency say to there be too much prescribing too much emphasis on be ill and not enough emphasis on be and stay well to take public health include mental health seriously and build society that understand and promote wellbee to keep people healthy before they need to seek treatment with gp be what good preventive approach look like achieve that vision will take long time and change can not come soon enough for people in my constituency who so desperately need to see their gp today or tomorrow but we have start as we mean to go on and we will not stop until we have achieve the change that we so desperately need rise before call the chair of the health and social care committee inform the house that there will be time limit of three minute on back bench speech and six minute on maiden speech the challenge face the nhs be no secret in my new role as chair of the select committee have begin to meet key stakeholder the list of thing that we need to consider be enormous pay credit to those who stand for the committee and welcome those who make it on understand that conservative member have be choose but do not yet know who they be ask they to forgive if they be here look forward to crack on will start by highlight to ministers few of the report by the previous committee which urge they to look at one be on dentistry and another on pharmacy and they be from and so they be extremely current there be note of frustration in the dentistry report as it point out that it make the same recommendation that the committee have make year prior hope that this government will take our committee recommendation extremely seriously such cross party recommendation be make thoughtfully we be here to help today will focus on the gp crisis another committee report from october for which take no credit it be do by the previous committee so credit should go to its previous chair and member point out what we already know gps be overstretch and patient be frustrated the british medical association report that single gp now manage an average of patient significant increase on figure know that there be even more acute number across the country that have lead to long wait time and difficulty in access care one of my constituent write to about his wife who be struggle to book gp appointment the surgery do not even take phone call or at least that be what she think it open an online form for few minute at am and as soon as the appointment be go it close the form we then call the practice which point out that patient could ring although it seem that that message be not get across to those patient that experience be be feel across the country but do not blame the gps because they be try their very good the royal college of general practitioners find that over of gps might leave within the next five year with stress be key factor and the crisis in general practice affect the entire nhs when patient can not see gp they often turn to worsen pressure on emergency department gps play vital role in manage long term condition and co ordinating social care at both end of that flow of patient without function general practice system the entire healthcare ecosystem suffer so what can be do the committee make four main proposal which hope ministers will include in their year plan first we need to urgently increase the number of fully qualified gps in the system that mean more than just train they retention be also key secondly we must embrace and improve digital health solution undertake full review of all primary care it system from the point of view of clinician and patient we also have to accept that for some people digital just do not work be member of that committee and help to author that report one of the key thing that we want to see from the clinical perspective be the ability to join up the it side so have place to share technology be really important for example every gp practice suffer with the question of how to set up its appointment system yet bizarrely if want to set up as gp on my own there be no centre of excellence to say what be the good way to do so do the chair of the health and social care committee agree that it would be valuable if we have single point of expertise that each practice could ask what the good solution that you ve see elsewhere in the country thank the hon gentleman for his work on the previous committee the gps have speak to point to that report as describe what they would like to see do so all credit be due to the idea that have come out of it the third area wish to mention be prevention which be at the heart of the darzi report that report make it clear that focus on prevention and early intervention will relieve pressure on the nhs in the long run finally want to talk about continuity of care which be key theme indeed an entire chapter in the darzi report it make it clear that see the same gp over long period lead to few hospital visit low mortality and less cost to the nhs this be not about some sort of nostalgic hark back to the way thing use to be if we want to solve what be in my view the big thesis question in the nhs today the productivity issue we need to be look at intervention such as that continuity of care within gp practice understand the whole person and the whole family be one of the way the report identify of make gps time more productive the challenge be immense but not insurmountable we owe it to our healthcare professional and most importantly the patient to fix this crisis and look forward to work collaboratively with my new committee member to help the government do so some of we newly elect or return mp have only just get our accommodation and office sort out so commend the government on the speed with which they have get surgeon back to work resolve the doctor strike review and assess the crisis and make announcement for decade of national renewal they have also affirm the view that our nhs should be treat not as shrine or beyond question but as something that must be return to deep service to our country and play its part as health and economic public service lord darzi review for the government highlight the critical issue in the nhs and the state we be in and particularly the underfunding of primary care it have be neglect in favour of creep trend towards hospital service under the fail principle of leave it late the crisis mode set that apply across our public service under the last government by design people end up in because of failure to plan for gp and primary care with few gps than other high income country the review also point out significant health inequality with deprive area historically receive insufficient resource in bury north child poverty be up to densely concentrate in just three of our nine ward life expectancy for those live in bury north range enormously the difference in life expectancy between north manor and east ward be five year for woman and nearly seven year for man public health intervention cost only quarter of the amount that clinical intervention do to add an extra year to life expectancy so do my hon friend agree that the reduction of the public health grant be an appalling false economy and should be restore as soon as finance allow to at least level of funding my colleague make valid point defer to her knowledge of the public health system the distance of mile or so have huge impact for the man and woman live in east bury urge those carry out the government review to see how in constituency like mine specific intervention could address those deep health inequality and identify the work we need to do to resolve that impoverishment in densely populate area and that ingrain health inequality urge the government also to adopt multidisciplinary care model and shift care close to home to address these issue sentiment that know ministers share take wide view the funding formula be outdated and an update be long overdue that update should take into account the weight of funding pressure for area such as mine with mix of economic and demographic inequality include the fact that so much of the revenue that our local authority raise be immediately swallow up by adult care and the disastrous special educational need system symptom of the crisis mode mentality under the previous government the government have waste no time invest million to recruit thousand newly qualified gps and address the dental care crisis with urgent dental appointment the government also aim to expand the role of pharmacy measure hugely welcome to reduce the burden on our gp and hospital care and crucially also for those live with chronic illness or condition boost to the engagement patient can have with health decision maker via the nhs app and an improved trust status for healthcare professional will boost this too and reduce the bureaucracy in our caring system there be well know say in good hospital the good hospital keep people out of they and get people out of they this principle strike at the heart of what have go wrong in recent year the problem in emergency service and waiting time stem from failure over the past year to design by this doctrine the key to resolve those issue lie in primary care prevent people from need hospital service in the first place and enable fast discharge when they do that be where the focus must be today speak as chair of the all party parliamentary group on eat disorder eat disorder be national emergency hospital admission have rise by in the past five year while more than sufferer be stick on waiting list while their condition get seriously bad eat disorder be treatable but the treatment must be timely and appropriate if sufferer be to make full recovery early diagnosis be crucial accord to the charity beat approximately million people in the uk have an eat disorder and be sure that many of my colleague have either friend or family member or know about constituent who be suffer from an eat disorder the soon person with an eat disorder access the right treatment the more likely they be to recover when eat disorder be leave undiagnosed or poorly treat they can be killer eat disorder be the mental health disorder with the high mortality rate and there be still stigma surround they there be still too many who think that have an eat disorder be choice what terrible thing to say about people who be suffer from an illness that it be choice only of people with an eat disorder be underweight yet some eat disorder service and gp service still only offer treatment to patient depend on their body mass index many eat disorder sufferer be tell that they be not thin or not thin enough other be tell once they return with an even low bmi that they be too sick or their condition be too complex to be treat that happen only because too many sufferer be leave untreated when full recovery be perfectly possible will my hon friend give way would rather not because too many people want to speak nhs waiting time be one of the big barrier to treatment at the end of more than child have enter treatment for an eat disorder but of those be make to wait over three month for treatment three time the target for routine referral miss the target waiting time standard can severely harm the progress of child recovery even more shockingly an access and waiting time standard for adult do not even exist will continue to work tirelessly to improve eat disorder care in particular by fight for improved access for treatment and for more suitable treatment option for individual patient we on the appg have commission an inquiry and hope the government will carefully listen to the recommendation in no one should be condemn to life of illness nor should anyone die of an eat disorder rise order before call the next speaker be go to give some helpful guidance to members still wish to speak intervention be only go to eat up your own time and that of other and may well see you put to the bottom of the list be glad that this debate have be call across the house story of failing in primary care be too familiar and frankly too distressing the darzi report make it clear that since the announcement in the late of the so call left shift the shift from hospital care to care in the community we have see the number of people treat in hospital rise indeed of the nhs budget be now spend on hospital compare with in the late as darzi say there be no left shift just right drift let we be clear gps work hard and do fantastic job just few week ago visit the fantastic hebden bridge group practice in my constituency the doctor conduct about appointment week and while they be fantastically efficient that be take its toll the general medical council national training survey use to be proud to work on that report every year find that of gp trainer say they always feel wear out at the end of the day this be simply unsustainable we see the impact of the unsustainable model and the underfunding in our constituency every week in my constituency the calder community practice in todmorden close with over patient on its book because there simply be not anyone able to take it on the darzi report make it clear that we need to prioritise primary care and care in the community the left shift must not be slogan but create real action it can not be right that last year patient each day be admit to hospital for something that could have be treat elsewhere and close to home look forward to support the government amendment and to work across the house week in and week out to make sure that we rebuild the nhs and get it the support it need the darzi report make it very clear that our nhs be fund overstretch and too hospital focus that have also be focus of today debate so far welcome what hear from the secretary of state in last week debate on the darzi report about investment and reform and shift from hospital to community and from sickness to prevention we all want those thing but they will not happen without more investment and without crucial reform in the way the nhs be fund we have see drift towards an increase focus on acute service and on hospital service at the expense of investment in preventive healthcare and the primary service that we all recognise be so needed and that my constituent in north herefordshire so desperately want they want to be able to see gp and they want to see the community frontline service that will save their health and will save the nhs money in the long run can the minister assure that she and her colleague have be do everything possible to urge the chancellor to make available the billion of pound of investment in the nhs that be necessary to bring we back up to scratch in comparison with our peer darzi say that we be underfunde in comparison with similar health service will she assure that the government be consider put in place some sort of mechanism to protect funding for primary and community care and indeed to ratchet it up over the year the way thing happen at the moment be that hospital constantly overspend and those overspend be constantly plug which be why the money be go more and more into hospital and less and less into primary care will we get the billion of pound of investment in the budget that we need and will we get that protection and ratchet mechanism for primary care funding that be the only way to ensure that the extra doctor extra appointment and so forth be deliver there be an old irish saying your health be your wealth and all the money in the world and all the nice thing mean nothing if we do not have our health too many people in my constituency do not have good have diabete which be high than the london and uk average and the rate of preventable death be almost high than the england average time and again when knock on door across ealing southall people tell three thing they can not get gp appointment when they need it they can not see doctor face to face and if they be lucky enough to see doctor they never see the same one twice with long term condition such as diabete not see the same doctor be damage the health of my constituent they be get sicker and they end up rely more on expensive hospital service in southall emergency hospital admission be high than the england average why can my constituent get to see doctor for starter there simply be enough north west london have ratio of one gp for every patient lot bad than the uk average we have have year of the conservative party run our nhs and it be clear that it have run it into the ground it start with big bang approach and the disastrous top down reorganisation of the nhs that cause so much damage that even they recognise it in the end and they have to dismantle many of the change few year later but not before the rot have set in since then their approach have be like move the deckchair on the titanic all they can come up with be piecemeal tweak and small pilot that never seem to amount to anything in the meantime the nhs ship be slowly sink lord darzi independent and honest report find that patient have never be more dissatisfied with the service they receive can only take the empty conservative benches as proof that they be finally embarrassed about it we must also ask why conservative members have be happy to preside over year of decline in our nhs be it because they want it to fail or to replace our nhs with privatised american style insurance system the mask slip during covid when they fast track their private healthcare mate and hand they multimillion pound contract for often dodgy personal protective equipment be that the future they have in mind for the nhs that be not what the public want and it be why the public vote they out my constituent in ealing southall be already impress by the new government approach they know that the damage to the nhs be so deep that it can not be fix overnight your health be indeed your wealth madam deputy speaker the last government fritter away that wealth give it to their private healthcare mate and squander it on damaging and costly reorganisation this new labour government will turn the page on over decade of tory decay and help we all to live long healthy life call ian roome to make his maiden speech have spend most of my work life in the nhs but speak for the first time in the house must start with confession as some of the northerly member will recognise from my voice be not bear in the west country

to north devon would probably turn out to be an adventure confess to the house that do not think this place be quite what he or have in mind first want to thank my family friend and all my supporter over the year especially my two year old grandson clayton who probably win one or two vote as without they would not be here my constituency be fortunate to be famous for its stunning landscape and area of outstanding natural beauty with beach moor farmland and forest that draw countless visitor every year farming and tourism sustain many of our rural community with historic market town such as south molton set in roll countryside give way to stunning seaside destination such as woolacombe instow and braunton chivenor where be so lucky to be post all those year ago be now home to the royal marines commando logistic regiment and my area have proud military history now famous surfing beach such as woolacombe and saunton sand be once use as training ground to prepare ally force for the normandy landing behind the natural beauty the challenge that my area face be stark like many rural and coastal constituency it suffer from low wage which be nearly week less than the national average and an acute housing shortage that price young people out of our community or prevent they from start family in north devon as do even in the part of my constituency still face real deprivation in some part of ilfracombe for example the proportion of young people attain level qualification be barely above while life expectancy be year low than other part of devon out of uniform join the nhs start out as mental health nurse at north devon district hospital the most remote acute hospital in mainland england visit patient across unique community such as combe martin and lynton and eventually lead the campaign to build chemotherapy and day treatment unit my area suffer from shortfall in important medical service such as pharmacy nursing and in particular dentistry our hospital now have intensive care unit and operating theatre that be approach year old and be desperately in need of investment from the new hospital programme however have be astonish by the possibility on offer in my constituency numerous coastal seat across the south west mine include stand to benefit massively from investment in float offshore wind in the celtic sea clean energy an extended supply chain and high pay job could be shot in the arm for the economy of the great south west pay tribute to my predecessor selaine saxby who be absolutely right to identify that as massive opportunity that

countermeasure system to the royal navy thank to its hard work and some innovative engineering on an industrial estate in my constituency young people will be keep safe as they serve their country in uniform my constituency be one of hide opportunity around every corner we must seize they it be an immense privilege for to be north devon voice in this place and intend to do it justice it be privilege to follow that powerful maiden speech be certain that the hon gentleman will do his constituent proud as he do in his time serve in our armed force welcome this debate after year of conservative government our health service be in critical condition in my constituency the drive from the centre of hatfield to welwyn east take about minute but the difference in life expectancy between the two area be now year the responsibility for the crisis sit not with our wonderful healthcare professional but squarely with the previous conservative government have spend as much time as can with our nhs hero and recently see the professionalism of our paramedic at first hand after join shift with daisy and jake in the east of england ambulance service they be credit to their badge and be pleased to say that get through blue light okay but gps be battle backlog in my constituency more than people have be wait more than month for local appointment dentist be withdraw from the nhs include in peartree ward in welwyn garden city and invariably the most vulnerable be the most seriously impact as the darzi report make clear people experience homelessness attend four time as often as the general population and be eight time more likely to need in patient care all at immense cost to they and the overall nhs budget we will only rescue our health service if we reform primary care and that be why this debate be so important despite rise demand few nurse be work in the community in september than in september the nhs confederation be clear that spending in primary and community setting have superior return on investment compare with spending on acute hospital service and darzi be clear that it therefore make sense that there should be fundamental strategic shift to the community innovative work be out there in my constituency the hospital at home service run by east and north herts nhs trust be particularly powerful for those over who need rehabilitation and care but for whom the good place for that be their home and not the hospital the shadow minister the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson say that she be not expect to hear new idea but they be out there and it be the job of our government to embrace they and take they forward have every confidence that this labour government will do that the party that found the national health service have clear vision for the future from analogue to digital from hospital to community and from sickness to prevention call llinos medi diolch madam deputy speaker be deeply grateful to the committed nhs staff who deliver exceptional care in hugely difficult circumstance health be of course devolve to the welsh government but people on both side of the border will recognise the struggle to see their gp increase waiting list and the dire state of service waiting list for hospital treatment in wales reach record high this year and nhs dentistry be non existent in many part of wales in my constituency valley dental will soon become the fourth practice to withdraw nhs service since late between january and december only of people in wales receive treatment through an nhs dentist and in north wales that figure be despite that the secretary of state for wales have hail welsh nhs dentistry as model of success follow long campaign by plaid cymru the north wales medical school recently open its door at bangor university despite previous claim by the welsh labour government that there be no case for it hope the government will be receptive to our new campaign for dentistry school at the university which would secure high quality job for north wales and provide more dentist for an area beset by shortage at the labour party conference the secretary of state for wales announce that patient from wales could receive nhs treatment in england and vice versa under uk and welsh government plan to reduce waiting list yet the welsh government cabinet secretary for health and social care categorically rule out give patient the option to travel to england for more treatment my party obtain freedom of information response from three nhs body two in england and one in wales all three say they have receive no correspondence from the uk government or the welsh government regard the proposal perhaps the secretary of state could explain to the house what the plan mean for patient in wales fourteen year of under investment and the creep advance of privatisation have place heavy burden on our nhs pursue the same tired route will not deliver the thriving and improved health service that we all want to see for staff and patient of all our public service our nhs be the one that unite we the most it be in the room that our child our bear in it be there when our parent get old and when we receive the bad possible news it be there for we no matter who we be what we do or what we earn our nhs belong to we all the previous government inherit an nhs that be work with the high satisfaction level and low waiting time in its history the state of the nhs today where million people struggle to contact gp every month demonstrate their utter contempt not just for this precious institution but for the people it serve there can be no great example of the previous government failure than the decline health of our young people last year the number of under year old on waiting list for paediatric care in england soar to record high of over as lord darzi report show our child be some of the sick in europe with the high rate of obesity diabete and poor oral and mental health under the previous government watch of child lose regular access to dentist the number of child wait more than week for community health service hit in just two year and one in child be estimate to have mental health problem but be unable to access the right treatment the previous government fail our child from head to toe that be reflect in the experience of young people in my constituency where they and their family wait month and sometimes even year for support parent be desperate for help young people be desperate for healthcare and everyone be desperate for hope labour have fix our nhs before and under this government we will fix it again follow lord darzi report the prime minister have recognise the need to change our health service and have set out this government intention for year plan to change our nhs our health secretary have already commit to put in the extra resource we desperately need for primary care include million of investment to recruit newly qualified gps and to finally reform the broken dental contract to get more dentist into the community that need they unlike the previous government we will fight for our nhs we will not allow primary care service to continue to be overwhelmed we will not leave patient rot on waiting list and we will not let our child be the sick in europe we will fix our nhs we have fix it before and we will fix it again call martin wrigley to make his maiden speech congratulate my hon and gallant friend the member for north devon ian roome on his maiden speech start by thank my long suffer family especially

constituency name reflect our large market town but it could add dawlish teignmouth kingsteignton let alone the many village from starcross to kenton bishopsteignton abbotskerswell ogwell denbury ipplepen broadhempston and many more have be wonder what to tell hon member about my constituency perhaps the creative and innovative people include newton abbot own ollie watkins the member of muse

teignmouth or the story of dawlish violet jane austen visit keats poem or how dawlish become the home of black swan perhaps the protect shore of the exe estuary and dawlish warren home to many thousand of wildfowl and wad bird each winter suffice it to say the area be steep in history fame and natural beauty member will find much more than devon cream tea and scone with the cream and jam the right way up of course grow up in royal navy family we move around an awful lot move to dawlish be natural choice but suspect it be also my parent influence that cause to set my sight on this place in the they meet in downing street when my mother work in churchill office my father tell we story of race to the parking place outside no in his old mg speak of previous politician pay tribute

to healthcare devon have both an age population and few hospital bed per head of population than the national average local hospital be fall into disrepair and be often overlook in the model of care it be during my first week in this place that hear from the local nhs trust that it be cancel the plan new teignmouth health and wellbeing centre that would have replace the crumble hospital due to increase cost and recent cap place on its capital budget bizarrely because of revenue overspend the project be cancel the new centre be to have become the home to local gps and local nhs service do write to my pen pal the secretary of state but have yet to hear back in the meantime be work with the gps to help they secure new home and avoid put primary care for patient in jeopardy teignmouth hospital be still under the threat of closure despite housing many nhs and voluntary sector service meeting recently with volunteering in health at the hospital with my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey we see how its model of wraparound care have be copy internationally and that singapore be now roll it out as global good practice as an engineer and liberal know that we do not need to accept broken system we can fix they and by empower people we can build bright and well future will do everything can in this place to fix system and help my constituent and help to protect the beautiful constituency the environment and its biodiversity as long as be here congratulate the hon member for newton abbot martin wrigley on his excellent maiden speech be sure he will be fierce advocate for the people of newton abbot and the surround area over the come year look forward to work with he be very glad to be able to speak in this debate because primary care be an important issue that affect all our constituent during the election campaign it be absolutely the no issue that come up on the doorstep across lichfield burntwood and the village in my constituency we be effectively here to discuss the centralism and poor decision making that typify the last decade and half of incompetence by the conservative party on primary care there can be few more obvious example of that than the fate of burntwood health and wellbeing centre in my constituency the building be home to gp surgery serve almost resident in the town the contract for the surgery expire in march last year but no replacement facility be ready for that date the surgery could not move which mean it have to close the building itself be still in use by the integrate care board and the practice be happy to seek an extension but that be not allow by nhs england as result more than one in eight people in the town have have to be redistribute to other surgery because process in london do not allow organisation in staffordshire to deliver the good solution for my constituent it be centralist and wrong it be wrong then and it be wrong now and it need to change even bad still be that the propose replacement facility originally schedule for completion in october last year be nowhere near ready we be expect planning permission sometime in early and who know when it will actually be complete this be such an important issue for my constituent in burntwood as we all know the potential knock on effect that delay in access primary care can cause the staff at the remain surgery be do all they can to support the community but at some point increase patient roll like this can not be mitigate it be one example of the challenge people face in see gp it be not the only one in my constituency and very far from be the only one across the whole country it can not be fix overnight year of it go wrong will take long than week to fix however applaud the health secretary for go as far as he have so quickly cut red tape to allow new gps to be take on and commission the darzi review of the nhs so that this party the one that create the nhs can ensure that we build health service that be fit for the century thank the hon gentleman for not use all his time call tom gordon to make his maiden speech let begin by congratulate my liberal democrat colleague on some fantastic maiden speech which have give lot to live up to while be on the subject of thank people let confess that commit cardinal sin at my election count reel off my oscars award style speech recognise everyone who have play part in the previous year of my life but importantly forget to acknowledge my agent the bad thing that any political candidate or member of parliament could do have not yet live that down still on the topic of thank yous and acknowledgement want to thank my tory predecessor andrew jones for his hard work as value constituency mp which many people mention throughout the election campaign and for his work in secure bathing water status for the river nidd this may seem little too obvious but the two principal town in my constituency be harrogate and knaresborough knaresborough do not like come second for good reason it be the old town an ancient market town feature fantastic castle and the nidd gorge with view over the river nidd it have strong sense of community and encourage anyone who have not hear of the knaresborough bed race to google it after my speech it be truly unique event harrogate be famous old spa town it have be renowne for its healing water which have draw people from all corner of the globe include the russian aristocracy and previously its royal family agatha christie turn up there after nationwide manhunt it be place of intrigue but in more recent year it have become place of culture cultural gem in the north we have the fantastic harrogate international festival whose annual calendar range from literature to art and everything in between we also have rhs garden harlow carr we be flower town and have win many award at both regional and international bloom festival we also have harrogate convention centre little while ago before be bear eurovision be host there one of the most frequent suggestion that come up be that should launch campaign to get eurovision back that rely on our get million of pound of investment into the convention centre something for which have already be campaign this be probably little know fact for those on the government benches but we will have something almost rival eurovision next march namely the liberal democrat spring conference and the glee club will be in town as well as the town of harrogate and knaresborough my constituency contain wide range of village but what interest be the people it be the people who make our area so fantastic it be that yorkshire grit determination and resilience that really make our area shine let give the house few bit and piece of potted history feature some famous and some more infamous folk from my part of the world there be mother shipton knaresborough answer to nostradamus who be make something of pariah and cast into cave and call witch to boot to this day the cave be one of the big tourist attraction in the area on the more infamous side we play host to the childhood home of no friend of this place guy fawkes the less say about he probably the well we also have more modern and contemporary people such as the lionesses rachel daly and olly alexander as well one person who stick out in the history book be blind jack who be say to have be the founder of modern road building he build kilometre on kilometre or mile and mile of turnpike century ago and rumour have it that north yorkshire council might get around to repair they some time soon as have say it be the people who make my constituency great let now reflect on the topic of today debate think the reason health be so important to we be that in those moment of desperation worry and anxiety when we reach out and go to that frontline of primary healthcare when we see our gps we be truly human look back at some of the more formative moment of my life and experience my life have be change when have go to gp it be apposite that be give my maiden speech today during breast cancer awareness month people have be wear lot of fantastic bright pink outfit to highlight that cause the reason get involve in politic be that the day before start my master degree in public health my mum be diagnose with breast cancer fortunately she have recover and be fine now and have even make she lib dem councillor in wakefield she have not yet forgive for that when we be go through that experience drop down to do my degree over two year so that could look after she and my little sister who be just five at the time we know that be able to access healthcare be the most important factor in get good outcome fortunately in our case my mum be fine but the complication of have go through lot of surgery and chemotherapy still live with she today as someone who live with chronic condition early this year be diagnose with ulcerative colitis know that get through the door to see gp can be the big barrier to get diagnosis treatment and support would not be here without my constituent it be an honour and privilege to have be elect to represent the people of harrogate and knaresborough and shall do my good whether it be on health culture and tourism or whatever wonderful fortune and opportunity await congratulate the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon on his cultured and move speech and on deliver it without note which be always very impressive be pleased to have the opportunity to speak in today debate come from family that be rich with gps primary caregiver who be the bedrock of our nhs my grandad aunt and uncle be all gps and my cousin be qualified gp too over the generation they have serve time have get hard and pressure have grow under successive conservative governments we see decade of under investment and mismanagement and lack of long term planning which have leave primary care on its knee indeed during the election campaign we have to fight to save our nhs walk in centre which have become important for so many people in my constituency be glad to say that we succeed however as the health secretary say when he visit lionwood medical practice in norwich north the cavalry be come in fact it have arrive we know that the task be monumental but as the party that create the nhs labour know how to fix it welcome our year plan which have primary care at its heart it will make sure that we shift from hospital to community and from sickness to prevention because of the black hole in funding that we have be leave by the conservatives we know that money be tight but we have already take action by invest million to recruit newly qualified gps of course primary care refer to dentistry too my county of norfolk have be allow to become dental desert or as the secretary of state have say the sahara of dental report july vol recent ons dentistry report state that of new patient in east anglia can not access nhs dental care which be shocking and totally unacceptable note that many pregnant woman be unable to access the free nhs dentistry care to which they be entitle in fact brand new datum from the british dental association and the women institute show that nearly million nhs dental appointment for pregnant woman and new mum have be lose since the start of the covid pandemic ask the minister to focus on what we can do to improve woman access to dental care because dentistry be feminist issue too welcome our plan to rescue nhs dentistry and will continue push with colleague across norfolk can see the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone in the chamber for the dental school that we so desperately need let finish with the health secretary own word the cavalry be come we will fix the nhs and make sure it be fit for purpose for my constituent in surrey heath access to primary care whether gps dentist pharmacy or optometrist have increasingly become postcode lottery vast dentistry desert maybe not of saharan scale have open up across surrey heath with resident simply unable to find an nhs dentist with an open list for they or their family when list do open up it almost immediately close again due to the overwhelming demand today family be be force to seek private provision for their dental care if they be able to stretch their finance that far or they simply forgo dental care altogether during the recent election even meet constituent who have resort to an amateur tooth extraction because of the lack of affordable dental treatment locally the postcode lottery extend to gp service too although the issue of access take on slightly different form surrey heath have some excellent and much love gp practice that be work hard to put the experience of user first but other have book system triage mechanism and approach to communication that leave patient feel anxious and frustrated pay particular tribute to the surgery in lightwater village in my constituency resident regale routinely with story about the fast efficient and friendly telephone service it provide the availability of on the day appointment and the generally high quality of the service it be little wonder that resident from mile beyond lightwater be so desperate to move their registration to that particular well run surgery some other surgery however be not so highly praise they be criticise for their impersonal online booking system and inappropriately long waiting time for appointment sometimes require patient to wait month or so to see gp this be not just poor practice it have real life implication for the health outcome of patient and for the economy as resident take long to be see long to be treat long to recover and long to get back to work than if they have be see early online booking system risk create digital barrier to entry for our most vulnerable resident it can not be right that those require healthcare might be dissuade from seek it because of the complexity of approach their gp or because they do not have can not afford or can not operate the technology require to book an appointment our local pharmacy too be under huge strain and commend the incredible local independent pharmacy who look after community across surrey heath so well be incredibly pleased that we be have this debate today not only to talk about the challenge of primary healthcare but to highlight some of the great practice that we can see within our community we need to support our local pharmacy which deliver so much care and support and we need as the liberal democrat manifesto propose to enshrine the commitment that patient can see gp within seven day commitment underpin by an associated commitment to train and recruit thousand of gps every year the darzi review have effectively shine spotlight on the key issue that gps and all in the healthcare profession have experience over the past year it rightly highlight the detrimental impact of austerity and the increase pressure that the pandemic put on an already stress service it also draw attention to the ongoing excellent work that be be do by nhs staff across the country in spite of rather than because of the facility system and process that be not fit for purpose and must now undergo intelligent reform primary care be an essential part of our health system it be where prevention meet treatment and gps can effectively undertake secondary prevention to keep people well for long for example people with chronic condition such as diabete and hypertension as public health consultant want to fight for our gps and make sure that they have the resource they need and want to highlight three thing today often speak to the royal college of general practitioners and we be in sync on these three thing the first be the long term workforce plan it be due for review next year it have be underfunde in previous time and we have to look at the modelling that be in the workforce plan now if we be move from hospital model to community model we have to look at the rate of increase that we expect in our gp service it currently stand at for gps and for hospital consultant this be in no way to denigrate my colleague who be hospital consultant they be incredibly important but we need to review this workforce plan know that the public accounts committee be look at this issue prior to the election as new member of the health and social care committee will encourage the continuation of that work secondly we speak early about mixed model of gp provision and how that will work in my constituency the worthing integrate care centre be due to open very soon it be part of neighbourhood model where gps will work with other healthcare professional to provide holistic wraparound service as have be demonstrate in this chamber today there be already partner practice that be work effectively this be about the interaction between neighbourhood hub and those partner practice it be pragmatic politic to get those to work and work well for our gp colleague finally we have talk about the national retention strategy gps be currently leave in their drove and even though many people be come forward as gp trainee it have be say in this chamber that we must ensure that we retain our gp colleague this issue be particularly acute in deprive area as public health consultant know that health inequality be one of the major issue in this country in order to address that and to ensure that prevention be writ large for those area of health inequality we must make sure that we be retain our gp colleague in those area access to nhs dentistry be deeply affect my constituent in stratford on avon with many community face what can only be describe as dental desert we have see dentist leave nhs service in recent year leave resident with limited option in some case my constituent be wait month for an appointment be force to travel significant distance to see an nhs dentist or bad be tell that they must pay privately or go without some have resort to emergency care and other have even attempt diy intervention the lack of access to nhs dental appointment can have serious long term health implication dentist can detect condition such as oral cancer diabete and osteoporosis during routine appointment we have hear that across the country million child have not see an nhs dentist in the past year which be shameful the situation be worsen in my area with more nhs dentist opt out of the system because the current dental contract be unsustainable it be not surprise that patient be be remove from nhs list exacerbate the crisis recent research by healthwatch base on series of national poll show that disabled people and those with long term health condition be more likely to avoid go to the dentist because of the cost the liberal democrats dental rescue package propose invest in additional dental appointment reform the broken nhs dental contract and ensure that everyone in need of urgent or emergency care can access an nhs dentist in their locality we should give our constituent the right to register with their local nhs dentist therefore urge the government to act now before the crisis deepen even far the fundamental promise of our nhs be that it be there for all of we whenever we need it no matter how much we earn where we live who we be or what part of the health system we need to access unfortunately after year of conservative government that promise have be break it be particularly disheartening not to hear any contrition or reflection from the shadow minister despite the hard work of nhs staff waiting list be at record high and patient satisfaction be at record low the nhs be near break point we all know this go into the election as we hear it from our constituent certainly hear it from mine in uxbridge and south ruislip even so the finding of the darzi review be still incredibly shocking primary care as liberal democrat members have say be the front door to our nhs but that front door be increasingly be slam shut in the face of our constituent and the effect be be feel fifty year of progress on cardiovascular disease be in reverse progress on cancer outcome have stall and cancer survival rate in the uk be fall behind comparable country there be lot to do and it will take time to do it but be reassure by the minister comment that this government be take the matter incredibly seriously welcome the secretary of state focus on the three critical shift need to modernise our health service and particularly primary care from analogue to digital from hospital to community and from sickness to prevention these shift will not only improve value for money in our health service but will ensure that everyone in our community live long healthy life we have hear today of the importance of gps particularly family gps gps be see more patient than ever before yet the number of qualified gps relative to the population be fall this strain will only be exacerbate as population grow and age welcome the government commitment to gp recruitment with million be invest in more gps the shadow minister speak about the capital investment pressure on the government and we certainly want to see capital investment in hospital include hillingdon hospital in my constituency but primary care capital investment be also need to unleash potential capacity we have hear from liberal democrat members as well as member on the government benches about dental desert and the need to improve access to dentistry welcome the government commitment to engage with the british dental association know one of the secretary of state first meeting be with bda and look forward to hear the outcome of those discussion lastly on community pharmacy meet representative of local and national pharmacy group in my first few week as an mp pharmacy be incredibly well place to take the pressure off gp service pharmacist be train professional and ready to go welcome the government plan to create community pharmacist prescribing service to utilise the skill of pharmacist will end as start there be lot to do to rebuild and reform our nhs so that it be there when we all need it we have do it before and we must do it again be in general agreement with other about the state of the nhs the nhs be liberal idea deliver by the labour party then break by the conservatives the attendance among conservative members at today debate show just how much interest they have in try to fix it the liberal democrats will act as responsible constructive opposition and work with the government to fix the nhs many problem on that point will the hon member give way no will not solve the crisis in access to primary care matter not just to patient face traumatic situation but to our gp surgery which be strive to do their good under the most difficult of circumstance our hard work gps dedicate year to training and work hard at what they do because they be passionate about be there for their patient for too long they have be let down and it be our job now to give they the mean to continue do their remarkable job we know the difficulty too often appointment be not available and patient and staff experience frustration and conflict priority when attempt to access service for patient that often mean resort to dialling or even and attend when issue escalate that put further pressure on our already overstretch nhs emergency facility which too often have to deal with issue that could have be fix by preventive primary care if patient could have access it in timely way gps in sutton and cheam tell that request for appointment be triaged because of the level of demand decision have to be make to prioritise patient with increasingly complex need often with very little information available unsurprisingly that be affect gps mental health and make it increasingly difficult to retain experienced staff far erode the ability of practice to keep up with demand the ask from gps in my constituency be simple the minister must act quickly to increase their budget and offer certainty to allow they to plan ahead financially after sustained period of real term cut in funding that will allow they to hire and retain more staff at competitive wage during this cost of living crisis low the collective workload and treat more patient more effectively it be not enough to simply offer more training place or incentive to train if surgery can not employ the gps who be already qualified and available that be particular problem in my constituency if the nhs can not compete with the private sector on pay or with overseas government who attract our doctor with improved condition low workload and possibly even well weather condition legend have it that there be place that have even more sunshine than bournemouth then it can not hope to retain gps we must make it easy for foreign student who have study and qualified in the uk to get the right to remain after their course should they wish to do so as the new government search for way to boost growth say that it be here in front of they there be no well investment in our future growth than good quality primary healthcare keep patient healthy able to provide for themselves and their family and live healthy and fulfilling life begin by reflect on the version of the nhs foundation set out by the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor be unfamiliar with that so thank he for that history lesson the fate of our gp service be feel nowhere more keenly than in thurrock where we have the high ratio of patient to gps in the country at coffee afternoon few week ago in aveley in my constituency where the local medical practice have perhaps the high patient load of the entire area we discuss some of the issue face the community as well as the solution it be microcosm of this debate people think they deserve to be able to see gp but my constituent particularly those in aveley show bit of common sense about what they could expect after year of conservative government run their healthcare service into the ground they know that they do not always need to see gp they know that sometimes face to face appointment be not necessary however they also want to know that the healthcare they need be there when they need it gps at the meeting have similar reflection they want to be able to spend the time that they have with their patient not form filling not run around bureaucracy and not refer back to secondary provider they want to spend their time deliver the good medical care possible great example of community healthcare be provide by orsett hospital our local community hospital what it do it do very well provide blood test dialysis and so on people can get the care they need on the doorstep however the hospital have be under threat of closure for as long as can remember be bear there and since then its service have be take away one by one we have healthy scepticism in thurrock for neighbourhood health hub we have be promise they for number of year but thank to combination of conservative government incompetence and conservative council incompetence locally we no long have the money to provide they in my constituency out of the three healthcare hub that we have be promise all we have so far be hole in the ground in tilbury one of our most economically deprive area say early that some solution also come out of that discussion if we be to turn around primary healthcare we need buy in from our population people need to know what service be available to they they need to be in charge of their healthcare include their preventive healthcare they need to know what be come up on the horizon for they and how they can take step to change outcome for themselves conclude by welcome this labour government approach to turn around the nhs towards preventive and community model be so pleased that we be have this very important debate this afternoon like my hon friend the member for stratford on avon manuela perteghella wish to highlight the issue face dentistry eastleigh be face an acute nhs dental crisis with many of my constituent unable to access basic dental care by the end of more than of child in hampshire have not be see by an nhs dentist in the previous two year accord to the nhs website only third of dentist in my constituency be take on new nhs patient have hear from resident who be desperately try to find an nhs dentist but after call surgery after surgery they can not find one take on new nhs patient some of adult in hampshire have not be see by an nhs dentist in the past two year that leave they with very limited choice go without any treatment at all try to find the money for private treatment or resort to diy dentistry one resident tell that their nhs dental appointment be cancel at very short notice with no alternative offer because their highly skilled dentist from poland leave after brexit and now there be no nhs dentist available at his local practice another constituent tell how his dental practice be struggle to keep appointment and now have only one nhs dentist available and that be on saturdays only patient be be ask to sign form agree to private treatment at nhs price without the protection that they would usually receive under nhs care the previous government push nhs dentistry to the brink of collapse hope the new government will reverse that trend by increase investment in dentistry use unspent fund to increase the number of nhs dental appointment and remove vat on child toothbrush and toothpaste to make oral health more affordable as local nhs dentist tell the dental contract be not fit for purpose his colleague be leave the nhs in drove my constituent in eastleigh would benefit from an emergency rescue plan for nhs dentistry proper investment to tackle this crisis would offer more nhs dental appointment and deliver free check up for child this be the kind of direct action that we need to prevent more child from suffer and to ensure that everyone regardless of their income can access high quality dental care may congratulate hon member on their wonderful maiden speech the challenge face primary care service in our country be set out in damn detail in lord darzi report after year of conservative mismanagement thank the secretary of state for bring that report so quickly to the house and get on with the job of make our nhs fit for the future from knock on door in gloucester know that access to gp and get an nhs dental appointment remain two of the big challenge face my constituent recently hold cross party meeting with councillor in tuffley and grange ward in my constituency about the challenge that resident be face in get gp appointment know that we have issue with access dentist in particular with more than patient per dentist that be despite the fact that frontline worker in our nhs be work hard than ever retention in our workforce be key issue so will the government look at family friendly policy to ensure that we retain as many frontline key worker as possible be surprised to hear the shadow minister speak about prevention because during year of conservative health policy they seem only to have prevent my constituent from get access to the healthcare they need prevention be important to this government strategy for health it be well for patient and it get they easy access to the care they need and well health outcome it be also well for the taxpayer and far cheap than go to the hospital when it be too late be pleased to see the government be already take action but we have to get this right there be principle in the nhs of get it right the first time and be pleased to see and hear that the secretary of state and his team be take time to listen to our health service in put forward our year plan to get the nhs back on its foot and fit for the future our nhs may have be break by the conservatives but it be not beat it be always in debt to the frontline staff and we all owe they personal debt of gratitude welcome the plan to tackle red tape in primary care and ensure that we focus on patient care and deliver the good care welcome the work towards recruit newly qualified gps we be bring back the family doctor and we be ring in more urgent dentist appointment we will fix the mess that we inherit from the conservative party but it be important to my constituent that we get it right the first time the government be get on with the job of do that will cut to the chase the state of nhs primary healthcare in my constituency be depressing would like the minister help with three local issue first with nhs dental care provision in the light of the hathaway dental practice close its door to nhs patient on november secondly the stalling of propose medical centre in calne for more than four year due to delay by the icb and thirdly the decision to refuse licence for new pharmacy in corsham however give the shortage of time will concentrate on the urgent matter of the closure of dentist surgery as everyone in the chamber be aware dental service be break people be pull out their own tooth and then be rush to the nhs to deal with problem that be everywhere however integrate care board across the country be underspend million on dentistry chippenham come under the bath and north east somerset swindon and wiltshire icb and accord to freedom of information request to the british dental association that icb dental underspend amount to million mention that because there be several hon member here with the same icb my constituent be horrified we be about to lose yet another nhs dental practice on november in part due to recruitment challenge but mostly because of the dental contract system in my first week as an elect member for chippenham attend briefing on preventive healthcare with the secretary of state and feel reassure that the issue be be look at however three month have pass and have see nothing concrete from the government about reform of the contract or even propose consultation timeline implore labour health team to urgently review the nhs dental contract system and stop dental healthcare be privilege the icb repeatedly say it will come back to and the practice owner tell they can not get this to work truthfully be at loss the government along with the care quality commission and my local icb say they be do something but nothing seem to happen implore the government to work with liberal democrat members who want the good for our nhs we agree that more preventive approach be need so much be break and we need to put it right together now before it be too late first must declare as the shadow secretary of state for health and social care the right hon member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins remind last week that be surgeon have therefore an interest in this matter but so do we all the last government should be truly ashamed of themselves see but one remain member colleague of mine sit on the conservative benches general practice have be badly neglect the public could see that surely the government must have know it certainly patient could see it give their scramble on the phone at hop not to be at the end of the queue for one of the very few appointment with one of the very few doctor during my career have see the number of hospital doctor and consultant increase many time but we have see very little increase in gp number and now we live with the consequence too many exhausted gps many leave the profession altogether or retire much too soon and now the spectre of two tier gp system as private gp service expand rapidly all over the place we can and will do well than this we already be do well with plan to recruit many qualified gps without job into practice without doctor today we must look after our gps as never before we will move much of our care out of our hospital and into the community but it be on gps that we will depend to achieve that gp service will expand to provide community investigation facility specialist and surgical service and much more as we rightly adopt the new government agenda of move care out of hospital we must ensure that gps have the very good it and technology we must connect the gp it with the hospital it so that can see the same record as the gp the nonsense of typed letter and fax machine should end completely be however optimistic scientific advance continue to astonish we we know what we have to do and we have the determination to do it doctor and patient will support this let we get to work general practice be the good of the nhs and we must support it in my constituency of west dorset as across the country community pharmacy be be ask to deliver more and more primary care service increasingly act as an alternative to gp surgery they be deliver vital healthcare service such as health consultation and vaccination however the funding model for community pharmacy be outdated and insufficient and do not reflect the expand role that they now play in our healthcare system community pharmacy england report that one sixth of pharmacy could close within year and the national pharmacy association estimate that the average pharmacy will lose this year this be be play out writ large in my constituency lyme regis have recently lose its last remain high street pharmacy our beaminster and sherborne pharmacy be report six figure annual loss due to the unsustainability of the funding framework funding model that as the pharmaceutical services negotiating committee suggest do not account for the high operating cost in rural area as well as wild fluctuation in medicine price that can result in pharmacy lose money on every prescription issue of certain drug community pharmacy also have to operate within system whereby they get compensate only for consultation that lead to prescription be issue that lead to perverse focus on patient where medicalise outcome be most likely urge the government to re evaluate the funding model for community pharmacy we need system that recognise and reward the broad role that pharmacy now play particularly in rural area pharmacy be deliver critical health service yet they be be financially penalise because the funding system be still base on an outdated model if we continue on this path we risk lose these vital community asset pharmacy in rural place such as west dorset can not survive on the current funding framework they be lifeline for many of my constituent and without immediate action we could see further closure which would leave vulnerable population without access to vital healthcare service at year below the average for england life expectancy in my constituency be the low in the country for man and woman lord darzi recent report point out that people in the most deprived area of england be twice as likely to wait more than year for non urgent treatment those problem be compound by poor quality housing low income and insecure employment which be particularly pronounce in my constituency that be evident in the casework that my constituency office receive one man whose son get in touch with recently have be wait year for simple hernia operation and it have impact on his mental health it have lead to the son fear that his father could take his own life physical health inequality contribute to poor mental health and the crisis surround it chris whitty report on health in coastal community detail the alarming rate of diagnose severe mental illness in my home town of blackpool there be over hospital admission for intentional self harm in suicide rate among man be the second high in the country and people have severe mental illness recently have the opportunity to meet staff and patient at the harbour in blackpool modern mental health hospital with fantastic facility however the bed facility be hugely oversubscribed and patient be routinely send hundred of mile away to receive hospital treatment put undue pressure and stress on their family the lack of mental health bed have knock on effect on blackpool victoria hospital where the person facility have hold up to patient wait at one time hour to be see those wait time have be normalise but they can mean the difference between life and death the number of hospital admission for child with mental health problem in my constituency be around high than the national average urge the minister and the secretary of state to consider the model of mental health support champion by charity in my constituency such as counselling in the community an award win mental health charity lead by its incredible founder and chief executive officer stuart hutton brown it use the skill of trainee counsellor give they invaluable career experience while act as lifeline for its service user empower such charity to expand their work rather than rely on the private sector to plug the gap in the nhs be great model that will enable we to put money back into the community rather than into the pocket of private provider and offer well value for money those problem be distil in blackpool be encourage by the government recognition of the challenge know that the minister department be prepared to face up to they but sadly in blackpool they be all too apparent the ongoing crisis in gp access be as acute in my constituency as elsewhere that be not simply because there be more patient but because today patient have great health challenge and need to see their gp more frequently that be why simple comparison with gp ratio from the past do not work we need health service capable of meeting today need not those of year ago in horsham it have become routine for surgery to fill all available appointment within minute of opening relatively junior staff be oblige to spend the rest of their time say no to frustrated anxious and not infrequently angry patient the danger be that we might enter spiral of decline whereby demoralise staff leave pile more pressure on to those who remain and scar off replacement before they have ever have chance to settle we must get working condition right and that can not be achieve in state of permanent understaffing we must also get more from the service that we already have unleash market force on the nhs and set pharmacy gps and hospital against each other be mistake effectively they be in commercial competition to provide more of the treatment that pay well and less of those that do not only integrated care board be in position to take holistic view of patient provision but that be not really happen yet there be any number of alarming statistic relate to our health service but will conclude on one that be bit more positive as mention by one of my colleague early study by the university of cambridge and other suggest that where patient be see by the same gp over year the average mortality rate decline by that be remarkable level of improvement more than could be expect from almost any other intervention let we give gps the space to do their job properly and let we support this motion want to speak about some of the challenge experience when be out in my constituency whether before the election or since whether be out in throckley in the western reach of newcastle or in otterburn bellingham or wark in the tyne valley the inability to get decent gp appointment be continuously raise with as one of my constituent great frustration and they appreciate the sheer scale of the task that this government have inherit one of the thing want to gently ask of the health team on the front bench be that when we look at build the community health service that we so desperately need we consider that our rural community in particular have suffer from health service be hollow out for year if people be force to go on public transport and it take hour to get between small town and village the barrier to gp appointment become all the big that be communicate to throughout the election in visit to ward that do not think labour canvasser have knock in before many resident of hexham raise it as one of the primary reason for switch to the labour party and it be why be stand here as hexham first ever labour mp five out of the seven dentist in my constituency be not accept new patient that crisis be particularly acute in the western part of newcastle in callerton and throckley it have be raise with multiple time on the doorstep and the devastating impact of that crisis on family and on people mental health as well as their physical health have be illustrate by many of the contribution from across the house the absolute disgrace of people get visibly emotional when talk about their struggle to secure dentist appointment in century britain be one of the many badge of shame that the conservative party should wear as it consider its future note the empty space on the conservative benches ultimately want to pay tribute to the gps and frontline staff who work tirelessly to deliver healthcare across my constituency and far afield but also to emphasise that the challenge face the nhs have never be great particularly in rural area the nhs have be bring to its knee by year of mismanagement and complacency and we now need to rise to the challenge be confident that this health team and this government will do so we know that primary care have be struggle struggle to meet target keep up with demand and help the population remain healthy those difficulty be particularly acute in rural area such as glastonbury and somerton where primary care face specific issue such as recruitment retention and access to service gps serve crucial and multifaceted role in healthcare but they be all too often inaccessible in rural area last year in somerset of gp appointment take more than two week from booking to appointment high than the average wait in england and of appointment take well over month gps play crucial role in serve people mental health as well as their physical health the environment food and rural affairs select committee report on rural mental health conclude that nhs mental health service be not fairly accessible for rural community one size fit all approach do not fit everyone appropriate service should be develop to serve rural community to help mend the mess leave by the conservatives the lib dems want to give everyone the right to see gp within seven day or within hour if urgent with more gps to deliver on that commitment rural community also suffer from poor access to public transport which make it more difficult to access service and poor rural broadband which make it hard to access online service it be clear that cross departmental work be need to address the challenge rural people face in access mental health support those hurdle must be factor into the national strategy that be focus on address mental health we must look at how pharmacist can ease the pressure on gp service but they too need urgent support between april and june there be net loss of community closure and only opening the rate of pharmacy closure in glastonbury and somerton be shockingly near double the national average community pharmacy provide an essential high street service in rural market town but many have now simply go the liberal democrats believe that we need clear more sustainable long term funding model for pharmacy and we must build on the pharmacy first approach to give patient more accessible routine service and ease the pressure on our gps the new government have speak out about our crumble public service but now be the time to act my constituent can not wait countless time on the doorstep during the general election campaign discuss primary care with people in north norfolk and the damn legacy of the last conservative government mean that almost everyone in my area have their own story story of people who be wait four week to see their gp about anything non urgent of people whose oral health have decline so much that they be no long able to smile of people who be worried for the supply of vital medicine the primary care crisis be acutely feel in north norfolk and be glad that it be the liberal democrats who will be push this government to bring forward solution resident in blakeney be set to lose their rural branch surgery at the start of next month despite overwhelming effort to save it many people who live in blakeney rely on that surgery and have base their independent living plan around it surgery be key community asset and people will genuinely suffer if they be lose it be why have be proud to support our call for small surgery fund to give financial stability to surgery like that in blakeney hope that today the minister can tell we whether the government would support that the dentistry crisis be another of the big issue for north norfolk the hon member for norwich north alice macdonald remind we that the secretary of state for health and social care have describe norfolk as the sahara of dental desert have be pleased with the progress we be make work with the integrate care board in the month since my election safeguard service in holt and wells and push forward the case for new dentistry school at the university of east anglia have enjoy work with my colleague the hon member for norwich north on that this issue matter to people like my constituent alan he receive no state support despite his wife be unable to work and when they need urgent dental treatment he be force to dip into his small saving it can not be right that when someone pay in to the system all his life it simply be not there when he need it these problem be deeply rooted mental health service do not have the network to really reach people in rural area our small surgery be vital because of our lack of public transport infrastructure our gps struggle to find new partner because of ballooning property price and our pharmacy and hospital can not attract the specialist they need because there be not the housing the solution to these problem in primary care require an holistic approach so hope that the government be take step to stop these problem be siloe all liberal democrat mp be champion for our leave behind local health service urge the house to support the motion and show that we mean business about bring our primary care service like those in north norfolk back from the brink every member who have speak from whichever side of the house have speak eloquently about their constituent difficulty access primary care as the lib dem mental health spokesperson want to focus on some potential initiative that will help solve those problem there be really good initiative in winchester that recognise the many socioeconomic problem that contribute to poor mental health the poor of people be twice as likely as people on an average salary to experience mental health issue so in that fantastic initiative local nhs mental health service be work with winchester citizens advice to help people with mental health issue deal with trouble like debt monetary issue and housing issue it be save huge amount of nhs resource analysis show that for every spend on the initiative avoid about in cost and people be less likely to have to engage with mental health service again would be really keen for the mental health team if they be willing to do so to meet and the team in winchester that have come up with this initiative because it really could be roll out over the rest of the country when we discuss community mental health we often talk about community mental health hub for which the liberal democrats have be call for long time so that we can proactively engage with people at risk of mental health issue we know what those demographic be we target physical health screening at the demographic that be likely to suffer from those disease and it be the same with mental health we know that military veteran and their family woman one year after give birth the community and other demographic be at high risk of experience mental health issue and we could be engage with these people much more proactively through community mental health hub to ensure that they do not end up need to access primary healthcare finally although this relate to secondary care we must acknowledge the long waiting list for those who go to their gp and be refer for mental health treatment because they be huge and people can wait for month or for over year in that time people can end up go to which take lot of time and resource and cost the taxpayer lot of money gps in winchester tell that they spend huge amount of their time deal with people already on waiting list for referral who have come back again because they need help in the meantime so that would really help free up primary care thank everyone who have contribute to the debate and there have be lot of excellent speech in my first contribution in this house in the debate on lord darzi investigation last week raise the challenge of deliver primary care under funding model that have fail to take account of growth in cambridgeshire be go to reiterate that and will take every opportunity to reiterate it because it be gross injustice in cambridgeshire and other member have note it in their own area of growth as well as take action on the unfair funding model would urge the government to provide mechanism to pump prime those area of growth so that new service can be commission ahead of time to deliver those service as people move in much as we see with other service such as school my hon friend the member for horsham john milne mention cambridge university study show the benefit for patient of continuity of care think this will be real focus of the new chair of the health and social care committee my hon friend the member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran and it should be bring forward by the government to ensure well outcome for patient the study also show that when patient see the same doctor they do not need to see that doctor as frequently over the course of their treatment so it be win win we be see benefit not just for patient but for nhs service and ultimately benefit for we all again the cambridge study show that those benefit be feel most for old patient which be why the lib dems have be campaign for everyone over the age of to have access to name gp to get that continuity of care really urge the government to set an ambitious target as the lib dems have do to drive forward the strategy of get continuity of care improve outcome for patient and improve outcome and productivity for the nhs the nhs dental contract be so flawed that it punish dentist for overperforming so they can not meet patient demand even if they be ready and willing to do so during the election campaign in my constituency be strike by how many dentist contact to tell that the system be break one dentist take for coffee in dorking and she tell that she have quit as an nhs dentist because the sum simply do not add up it be cost she more to treat nhs patient than she be receive under the nhs contract that be why so many dentist be leave the nhs contract as we have hear from so many hon member the consequence for child in particular be devastating because they end up at just last week constituent contact to tell that they have be unable to afford private dental care for broken tooth so they have access cheap teledentistry company the result be botched job with they have permanent ligament and bone damage this crisis will end only when we reverse the previous government cut to dental care because everyone should be able to access affordable high quality dental care the liberal democrats have plan to fix our dental desert and urge member to support the motion in my constituency the propose gp health hub on reform road have be cancel the land that be need be own by the local council of which be member as be declare in the register of members financial interests and the council be ready to sell it however after long wait frimley integrate care board scrap its plan because of rise cost and interest rate that leave significant gap in our healthcare infrastructure with thousand of new home be plan and build we need gp facility to match but with the icb pull out it be maidenhead resident who will suffer resident in binfield in my constituency have no well luck get gp appointment with local gp surgery say do bother try to ring at am you will not get an appointment do even try st mark hospital in my constituency be cornerstone of our local community and year ago it be the local liberal democrats who battle to bring the urgent care centre to st mark in maidenhead however at the beginning of the pandemic the walk in centre be close on what we be tell be temporary basis to date it be yet to reopen and no matter how much we have try we have be tell that the system be good enough without it be local lad from my constituency and when be at primary school fall over and hurt myself and my mum hobble to st mark within an hour they have do an ray put in cast and send on my way home on crutch compare that with the situation now with resident tell time and again that they struggle to get the care that they need when they need it grandchildren who have have bang on the head turn up at st mark to be tell to go to wexham park in slough where they have hour wait in child cut finger open and instead of be able to take five minute trip up the road they have to endure minute rush hour drive to slough walk in urgent care centre be beneficial for our local community because they allow we to take the pressure off and the major hospital and provide that care locally it be not difficult concept allow people to get the care they need see their gps or pharmacist and use the walk in centre at st mark will mean few people in accident and emergency save hospital admission free up bed for those who need they and importantly save the nhs money the liberal democrats and our hard work local champion will always be there for the nhs and champion primary care we be committed to reverse the decline in gp number and ensure that all our community have access to the primary care they need when they need it the challenge be significant but they be not insurmountable and with the right policy and funding we can turn the tide on this and get people the care they need feel as if we be play game of top trumps with who have the bad dental service but service in south devon have be so badly neglect by the conservative government that we live in one of the bad dental desert in the uk nhs dentist in totnes dartmouth brixham paignton and south brent have close leave thousand of my constituent many suffer severe dental pain with no choice but to pay extortionate private dentist for help one of my constituent say my daughter be student at college and be on esa we lose our nhs dentist year ago in totnes we take the decision to go on basic payment plan that give we one check up and hygienist visit as have gum disease we can really afford it on visit to the dentist today we be hit with bill for small filling that my daughter will need have to pay upfront this be our food money for the next week go and will be the same again when she return for her appointment in october we will have to use the food bank to eat this month another tell she have regular infection in her wisdom tooth that require constant antibiotic treatment and she have be tell that it will cost to remove they or she will have to wait two more year for nhs treatment the state of dentistry in south devon be absolutely shocking there be currently no dentist take on new nhs patient not one in constituency of more than square mile it be shameful that there be not more conservative member on the benches beside to hear this people in devon and cornwall be wait day on average just to register with dentist that be four year the new government have talk about the benefit and importance of preventive healthcare and nowhere be that more clear than in dentistry it be not just about fill cavity and give someone nice smile we know there be link between gum disease and cancer poor oral microbiome can increase the risk of stomach and colorectal cancer we also know that visit to the dentist as child increase the chance of lifetime of good oral hygiene liberal democrat research have show that in the past five year more than child have be admit to hospital with tooth decay that be absolutely not what our hospital need after year of neglect from the conservatives and with system that be completely overwhelmed the government must immediately renegotiate the nhs dental contract have the minister consider increase the unit of dental activity to stabilise dental practice immediately before more of they go under the government must guarantee appointment for all those who need dental check before commence cancer treatment or chemotherapy and they must support preventive dental healthcare preventive care will always be less costly than the extensive treatment require later in life if people do not get into good habit at young age before make some brief comment about dentistry must say that some government members seem genuinely confused about our claim that the liberals have anything to do with the founding of the nhs urge they to google the beveridge report my grandfather be dentist so as child be privileged enough to have access to dental care as and when need it although when be eight do fall down the stair at his surgery and break my arm while he be do my dad filling so possibly his health and safety be not as good as his dentistry many child nowadays do not have the same access to dentistry as do as child in the past year in somerset the percentage of child see by dentist be just when the english average be more than the percentage of adult see in the past two year be still only the darzi review reveal that only about to of nhs dental practice be accept new child and adult registration that be leave many with no option but to go private my constituency of frome and east somerset be also consider dental desert it be predominantly rural which mean that access to service be even more limited the lack of public transport mean that access dental service be difficult already and with practice not take on new patient they be push even far afield have an email from two constituent from frome early this month they have be unable to see an nhs dentist for four year due to lack of availability for new patient they say in their email that it not only affect our oral health but contribute to broad health issue that can arise from neglect dental care and they be anxious about potential long term impact get dentist appointment should never be as hard as it be now and urge support for our motion to help reduce dental desert and rescue nhs dentistry from disaster congratulate my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan on introduce this debate echo her call on the government to boost access to gps nhs dentist and community pharmacist in my oxfordshire constituency the grow number of people move into the area have not be match by an increase in gp dentist or pharmacy service indeed frustration with the terrible conservative track record on these health issue be major factor in my election to this place in july in great western park in didcot where more than people now live there lie site ready to be develop into gp surgery and there be money from the developer to build it however the local nhs body responsible for build it and provide the doctor nurse and other support staff sadly have struggle to marshal the resource to do so call on the government to prioritise support nhs body and to provide the mechanism for bring forward primary healthcare meanwhile many people in my constituency particularly in didcot often can not see gp without the early morning telephone rush that my colleague have articulately summarise hop to get one of the precious slot at the gp surgery in didcot at which be register it be even challenge to get an online appointment with two minute window grant once week to try to fill in an consult form process that generally defeat for non urgent matter like my colleague hear from dentist in my constituency that the funding they receive for their nhs patient be barely enough to break even it be no wonder that private dentistry dominate in my constituency from wallingford to grove wantage and didcot as my hon friend the member for winchester dr chambers articulate mental health service particularly child and adolescent service be also under strain all of these service need well support so call on the government to take action and recognise that as lord darzi say in his report improve access to primary healthcare will significantly relieve pressure on and indeed the need for cancer treatment by enable early diagnosis and therefore proactive intervention very much welcome this debate gps be rightly pillar of our community doctor remain one of the most trusted profession perhaps unlike our but want to mention some of the other key profession in the primary care sector include practice nurse who dedicate their life to work on behalf of our resident right now practice nurse be work hard to deliver flu covid rsv and shingle jab to many of our resident they be the unsung hero who keep primary care go but their number be decline due to wage constriction new nurse look to boost their salary often opt for hospital base care because they can improve their pay packet with unsocial hour payment mental health nurse healthcare assistant and social prescriber also provide essential service and we must not forget receptionist who bear much of the public frustration after year of fail government they have my thank gps be in crisis the tories let waiting time soar and fail to deliver new framework contract for gps in time lead to industrial action be very concerned that in my area we have sleep walk into two tier health system with long wait for those who can not afford private care and access for those who can in henley we be see the first fully private gp practice and many people go for job with corporate insurance plan there be now routinely four week wait in place such as thame benson watlington and chalgrove where we have see significant housing growth as my hon friend the member for didcot and wantage olly glover mention developer fund have be collect but in oxfordshire they be not be release in time to deliver the infrastructure that be need want to highlight the impact of those wait on some of the most vulnerable people recently speak to my constituent suzannah windsburrow tenacious campaigner with learn difficulty who highlight to just how important timely access to healthcare be for she the collective impact of lack of access mean that people with learn disability die early than those without year early for man and year early for woman very much welcome the liberal democrat commitment on health and encourage the labour party to copy our manifesto honestly we will mind include our commitment to ensure that people can see gp within seven day or if it be urgent hour to more gps and to provide name gp for people over also hope that labour will copy our very important policy on deliver mental health professional in school give the time constraint will skip some example such as thornbury health centre and three shires medical practice which be already safely lodge in the secretary of state inbox instead want to focus on the dependence in the primary care system an ecosystem in which strain in one part have knock on effect in other and to illustrate that with an example from my constituency this summer meet community pharmacist in abbotswood an area with significant health inequality he raise the same concern about the flawed funding formula for pharmacy that we have hear today but he have an additional challenge the next door gp surgery with which his pharmacy have have symbiotic relationship for many year have be incorporate into large group the other surgery be in another urban area some mile away and difficult to access by public transport and the local surgery now offer patient only limited hour understandably many of they be switch to surgery in central yate which have an impact not only on the viability of that local gp surgery but on the community pharmacy which be miss out on the pharmacy first referral that it might have expect also once people have travel into town generally they will use the pharmacy there if that pharmacy be unable to continue people will miss out on its many valuable preventive service monitor medication provide service to those with diabetes and administer vaccination that will increase pressure on gps and our hospital the pharmacist also comment on the impact of the dental desert in my area as in other around the country people can not access nhs dentistry which lead to other health issue not be pick up want to stress that the government can not fix just one part of the system they have to look at the system as whole that be what the liberal democrats recognise in our manifesto urge the government to look at our plan for the nhs and work constructively with we to fix all aspect of primary care mainly want to talk about dentistry but first let support the comment of my hon friend the member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke gps in my constituency be leave at an alarming rate which be problem of great concern across somerset we have hear about the sahara desert if norfolk be the eastern sahara somerset and devon be the western sahara of dental desert more than half the child in somerset do not have access to an nhs dentist last year which put somerset in the worst hit of local authority area in the country the picture for adult be pretty similar set up survey back in to draw attention to the lack of dentistry in taunton and wellington official nhs figure show that in the access to an nhs dentist but that have go down to only this year as have be say of people who need an nhs dentist can not get one that be totally unacceptable situation and primary care time bomb because as we have hear the big cause of hospital admission for child under six be tooth decay also oral cancer be on the rise year on year and without early detection by dentist that will only get bad just as the social contract under which people feel that they would get care be break so be the dental contract itself urge the government to tell the house how soon they will repair the dental contract and when they will increase the unit of dental activity payment so that the contract work we need timescale for address that my constituent kathryn have be with her nhs dentist for year like so many other she lose they when that dentist withdraw nhs treatment but unlike many other people kathryn be undergo treatment for secondary breast cancer the side effect of which mean that her doctor have instruct she to have regular dental treatment she be now use her hard earn saving to pay for that dental treatment because it be not possible to get it on the nhs in somerset it be disgraceful and totally unacceptable that cancer sufferer be use their hard earn saving to repair the damage of the legacy of appal nhs dental service leave by the last government there be reference early to history and the origin of the nhs contend that have that debate be akin to two bald man fight over comb give how far back in history it go be allow to make that joke as be the minister for care the hon member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock stand today to place on record the shocking state in which the last government leave cheltenham nhs but will start by say thank you to the nearly people in cheltenham who have sign my petition to ensure that cheltenham get the gp surgery it need as our town grow gp wait time in cheltenham be variable but they be often far too long that be not because gps be not work hard one speak to recently tell that they be see dozen of patient day of course when it get that intense it be beyond the level at which most human can cope with the processing of information that be safety issue we owe great debt of thank to our gps other members have mention the dentistry desert research regularly on the internet and there be no dental practice can find that be take new nhs patient in cheltenham that be regularly the case interruption the hon member for gloucester alex mcintyre be shake his head because many of my resident end up go to gloucester on the odd occasion when they be lucky enough to find place for one of their child most of the time there be no space for adult regularly people in cheltenham be refer as far away as worcestershire for new dentistry that be shocking this all create tension in as we have hear in cheltenham department be downgrade to an overnight nurse lead service in may when the conservatives start govern alone people wait more than four hour to be see at cheltenham and gloucester department in may when the general election be call that number have balloon to people wait more than the target time that be absolutely shocking the increase pressure have be cause in many case by people inability to get dentistry and gp appointment local campaign group reach restore emergency at cheltenham general hospital be form to oppose that downgrade and my two predecessor fight the downgrade their good effort be afraid have not yet bear fruit will join they but it be now acknowledge by most people in cheltenham that it be possible our department will never be reinstate with doctor lead care the current set up put pressure on our hard work gps and it can not be allow to continue in the spirit of constructive opposition we will work with the government on solve these problem thank you for call in this important debate madam deputy speaker in west berkshire last year we experience increase in four week wait for gp appointment compare to indicate that more patient be struggle to access medical care that be compound by we have the low pharmacy provision in the country with patient per pharmacy compare to the national average of last week meet constituent to hear about their experience of healthcare service one share their frustration at see gp only to be tell that their issue fall under the remit of pharmacist then the pharmacist tell they that it fall under the remit of the gp that is unfortunately not unique experience with of people report poor experience with gps that be why service such as healthwatch west berkshire be so important the current governance model for partner gp surgery also need to be address to help maintain their very existence in particular by de risk lease in strategically important estate hope the government will look at the general practice premise policy review of and implement its finding to ensure that lease be assign to nhs body that will help with the retention of more gps which will in turn improve health outcome for patient the public be sick and tired of our fail nhs that be why in july this year they prescribe the conservatives with much need period of opposition hopefully repeat prescription hope we can now start treatment plan to get our nhs back to full health congratulate all those who have make excellent maiden speech today also congratulate the handful of conservative members who come out to try to defend their indefensible record on the nhs when it come to nhs dentistry constituency such as mine be some of the worst affect by the dental desert all around the country that we have hear about today the shocking legacy of the conservatives as my hon friend the member for dorking and horley chris coghlan and other have say we must have nhs dental contract reform now no more delay no more excuse one in five dentist have leave cornwall since and the number of urgent dental case be spiral out of control be not exaggerate when say that upset distressed parent contact every single day about their child rot tooth they can not find nhs dentist and they be completely at loss only last week panicked and anxious parent call georgina get in touch with because her daughter phoebe just year old be in need of emergency dental care and have already miss lot of school as result she need to have rotting tooth remove but her mother could not find an nhs dentist so instead she be send to the treliske hospital just few day later phoebe be urgently admit to with extreme facial swelling she be take into surgery where the rotten tooth be remove after much pain and distress her face have swell to the size of tennis ball and she have now be off school for week the stress and anxiety that this experience cause phoebe who by the way have complex special educational need her mother and the rest of the family be completely unnecessary if phoebe have just be give place with an nhs dentist the strain on the family and importantly the hospital that treat she would have be avoid entirely during the election campaign teacher from wadebridge admit to that she have resort to use plier to extract rotten tooth as the alternative be to receive treatment as far away as nottingham more than child be admit to hospital with tooth decay in cornwall last year alone the house need to come together and ensure that the problem of dental desert that we have hear about all day today be solve once and for all what kind of society be we if we allow our child indeed people of all age to suffer like this as we hear from my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan general practice be the front door of the nhs yet community in my constituency such as in arborfield green go without any local primary care provision this be an area that be grow by thousand and my constituent expect to have access to gps who provide timely and appropriate care the unfortunate truth be however that there simply be not enough gps we know where the fault lie the conservative party underfunding and poor workforce planning have lead to service in crisis jeopardise the standard of care that patient receive gp number have fall and million have be cut from general practice in real term since each gp in my local icb be be now responsible for on average more patient than in and nearly of gps say that their workload be impact patient safety it be clear that this be not sustainable system but sadly we never hear an apology from those on the conservative benches of whom there be five at the moment would be grateful for the minister view on the call from the royal college of general practitioners for an explicit reference to primary care infrastructure in the national planning policy framework this it argue would strengthen the ability of local planning authority to hold developer to account on social infrastructure such as gp surgery hope that the minister will ask his colleague at the ministry for housing communities and local government to consider the royal college response in order to ensure that place such as arborfield do not lose out any long and to ensure that as wokingham continue to build to government guideline we have more gps to cope with all the extra patient that the new building will bring be proud to speak today about our nhs which look after my constituent in esher and walton young old and in the middle every day but after year of neglect and failure by the previous government my constituent too often struggle to access primary healthcare which we believe should be right the nhs be deny necessary reform and resource and it have not be prepare for an age population with increase rate of chronic and complex condition the extra strain be demonstrate in the ratio of patient per gp and in the daily life of my constituent who suffer long wait or be unable to get appointment recently receive letter describe how gp appointment for constituent elderly mother be cancel at short notice and have not be reschedule after month despite several email problem like this be far from be one off in my constituency resident often struggle to get same day gp appointment and too many wait more than week our personal citizen contract with the nhs be implicit in be british but that contract be fray be able to access gp in timely manner be an essential expectation that my constituent still have which be why enshrine the liberal democrat guarantee of access to an appointment within seven day as right in the nhs constitution be so important it reflect the duty of the government to ensure that one local gp be always accessible the excessive wait time be intimately connect with the conservative failure to recruit and retain gps in the previous government manifesto they commit to recruit more than gps instead there be few gps than there be five year ago since then however the population have continue to rise and age and condition have become more complex the broken conservative promise yet another failure mean that in the last eight year the number of patient per fully qualified gp in the surrey heartland have rise to even though the uk have one of the low ratio of doctor to people recently rank out of oecd country even when people can get an appointment it be often not with gp often unknowingly as my hon friend the member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron point out the policy pursue by the previous government include the restriction on the recruitment of gps under the additional role recruitment scheme have result in incident of gps in esher and walton be offer voluntary redundancy even as resident struggle to get an appointment our most vulnerable patient have particular need for security and stability and this belief pin the lib dem conviction that everyone over the age of or with long term physical or mental health condition order call the liberal democrat spokesperson today mark the first liberal democrat opposition day in this house for year and we have dedicate it to the topic that be fundamental to constituent up and down the country carer the provision of care and the nhs as the liberal democrat spokesperson on hospital and primary care it be my honour to close today debate and to pay tribute to the many excellent contribution from my hon friend and hon member across the house commend my hon friend the members for north devon ian roome for newton abbot martin wrigley and for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon for their passionate tribute to their constituency in their maiden speech also pay tribute to the hon member for worthe west dr cooper for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley and for hinckley and bosworth dr evans who bring such valuable knowledge to the chamber during debate on healthcare our nhs be once the envy of the world the care compassion and accessibility that it offer be unparalleled sadly after year of conservative mismanagement our nhs and care sector be in crisis every day thousand of patient face agonisingly long wait often in terrible pain while try to see gp or get an appointment with dentist lord darzi report highlight the fact that primary care service be heavily underfunde which be lead to unnecessary hospital admission there be clear economic benefit to invest more in primary care with the first budget of the new government due to come to the house soon remind the chancellor that every spend in primary care be estimate to save in urgent and secondary care in my constituency of chichester people be deeply worried about access gps concern echo throughout the general election campaign and reflect in my surgery appointment with resident the public trust in the nhs have be erode due to the consequence of poor conservative management as my hon friend the member for esher and walton monica harding point out the conservative government promise more gps in but instead gp number have fall by almost and gp practice funding have be cut by million in real term since healthcare be not luxury it be necessity as liberal democrats we believe everyone should have legal right to see gp within seven day or within hour if it be urgent so we would pledge to recruit more gps to deliver on this promise we also want those over and those with long term condition to have access to name gp ensure continuity of care which help to prevent unnecessary hospital admission as the chair of the health and social care committee my hon friend the member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran mention continuity of care be vital for patient trust and staff morale this be not the first time have mention this in the chamber to the secretary of state but the collapse of not for profit gp federation serve chichester and the south coast last month be stark reminder of the system fragility patient appointment be cancel service be threaten and staff be leave unpaid the collapse be due to the erosion of contract value with primary care network and nhs sussex when gps be sit in my surgery tell they want to work but they can not with no reassurance that they will be pay for the work that they have do something have go terribly wrong dental care be another critical area within primary care we have hear today about dental desert across the country during this afternoon debate begin try to list every member who mention their dental desert and give up it be shocking to hear the statistic and the harrowing case study from across the house the liberal democrats be call for dental rescue package that include investment in more dental appointment reform the broken nhs dental contract and use flexible commissioning to meet patient need workforce planning for health and social care must also be write into law ensure that we have enough dentist to meet demand lastly we must reverse the conservatives cut to public health grant in order to support preventive dental care include oral health programme and promote healthy eat choice which will reduce the pressure on our nhs dental service the government have an opportunity to turn around decade of conservative chaos and mismanagement of our precious nhs and to give primary care the attention and focus it deserve and we will work constructively with they to ensure that patient in chichester and across the country get the care that they deserve this really have be vibrant and powerful debate thank the liberal democrats for use their opposition day constructively to shine sear spotlight on the challenge that our constituent face hon member make series of outstanding contribution but thank in particular my hon friend the members for aylesbury laura kyrke smith for bury north mr frith for calder valley josh fenton glynn for ealing southall deirdre costigan for welwyn hatfield andrew lewin for croydon east natasha irons for lichfield dave robertson for norwich north alice macdonald for worthe west dr cooper for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales for thurrock jen craft for gloucester alex mcintyre for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley for blackpool south chris webb and for hexham joe morris for demonstrate why our party always have be and always will be the champion of the nhs also congratulate the hon member for north devon ian roome for newton abbot martin wrigley and for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon on their excellent maiden speech it be quite shocking to note however that in spite of the vital importance of this debate to our constituent there be not single contribution from the conservative back benches hon member shame not only do the conservatives refuse to apologise for the last year but they have run for the hill their silence truly speak volume labour members deal with fact and the unvarnished truth on the subject of today debate the list of fact illustrate the appalling neglect and incompetence of the last year be truly as long as my arm if be to pick out just one statistic to summarise the last year might choose that the most common reason for child age five to nine be admit to hospital be tooth decay it be truly dickensian state of affair could also point to the uk decrease gp number as there be few compare with seven year ago against the backdrop of rise population or could pick the collapse in patient satisfaction from in to shocking last year or could single out the fact that more than pharmacy have shut their door since and that almost six pharmacy week have leave the market in the last year the charge sheet be so long that month of debate in this chamber could not cover the profound damage that have be do by year of short termism and sticking plaster politic and by the botched top down reorganisation in the reality be that the tories douse the house in petrol and covid light the match the reaction to propose ward closure in my local st cross hospital in rugby show how concerned the public be about the health system after year of underinvestment by the last government in this case however the closure be because patient be be care for close to home do my hon friend agree that bring more service into the community and into small hospital such as the one in my constituency be integral to manage present and future demand and to put our nhs on sustainable footing my hon friend be absolutely right this strategic shift from hospital into the community will be vital and central to our year plan for the future of our health and care system primary care be the nhs front door but the tories spend year bricke it over now it be wall off to million of people across our country so it fall to this labour government to tear down that wall we know that there be not second to waste not least on mental health it be unacceptable that so many child young people and adult be not receive the mental health care they need we know that wait for mental health service be far too long and we be determined to change that we will recruit additional mental health worker across child and adult mental health service we will introduce specialist mental health professional in every school and we will roll out young futures hub in every community we will reopen the front door to the nhs by rebuild general practice on the firm foundation it need to get the service back on its foot and fit for the future as well as need more gps our gps need decent premise from which to deliver high quality care to patient park road surgery in my constituency have be look for new premise for more than decade it serve patient out of an old victorian house but there simply be not the budget and the process be too complex will the minister commit to both look at the bureaucracy and press the chancellor for more capital investment in primary care as the darzi review show one of the most egregious example of the neglect and incompetence of the past year be the underspend on capital we be clear that number of premise across the country can be repurpose and that the bureaucracy need to be clear out of its way as the prime minister say early this week we will have mission about smart regulation and clear the bureaucratic barrier to change we be also cut red tape so that gps spend less time push paper and more time face to face with the patient they serve we be work to bring back the family doctor and to end the am scramble we have do more for primary care in the last week than that lot do in the last year on dentistry we will introduce supervised tooth brushing for three to five year old in deprive area end the national scandal of tooth decay and we be rebuild the bridge that the conservatives burn with the british dental association have already meet the bda and we will deliver rescue plan that get nhs dentistry back on its foot with additional urgent appointment start as soon as possible in those part of our country that need they most give the shocking state the last government leave we in be it not good that the grown up be now in the building and that we have see the urgency need in the nhs commission the darzi report and invest million alongside make our commitment to tackle dentistry use pharmacy and reduce the unnecessary burden thank my hon friend for her intervention pay tribute to my right hon friend the secretary of state for get the strike sort within week of we take power what change that have make we will reform the dentistry contract to make nhs work more attractive boost retention and deliver shift to prevention on pharmacy as my hon friend the member for bristol south karin smyth make clear we will shift the focus of our nhs out of hospital and into the community empower more pharmacist to prescribe independently and free up gp appointment for those who need they most that shift from hospital to community be vital for demand management in the primary and acute sector on the whole this have be an excellent debate but find it absolutely extraordinary that not single word of humility or contrition be utter by the official opposition where be the apology for the fact that they spend year bring our nhs to its knee where be the mea culpa for the way in which they spend year scapegoate the workforce dodge the tough question and pass the buck where be the acknowledgment of the fact that they call the election and run away from their billion black hole and from the multiple crisis in our public service while the conservative party continue to live in parallel universe we on the government benches be live in the real world we be honest about the scale of the challenge and we be up for the fight while the mountain before we be daunt we be not daunt instead we be focus on the future reform and rebuilding and on shift from hospital to community from sickness to prevention and from analogue to digital let we roll up our sleeve and get to work question put standing order no that the original word stand part of the question shockat adam gideon amos

question propose that this house do now turley rise in flood action week to raise an issue that be front of mind for so many of my constituent the flooding in september devastate home farm and business right across my constituency and those of hon friend across bedfordshire indeed my home in shillington be flood two month worth of rainfall in hour cause considerable damage to property and risk for people especially the elderly or vulnerable so thank all the first responder and council worker who work tirelessly to support my constituent congratulate the hon member on secure this adjournment debate during flood action week constituent of mine be also impact by the flooding across the county last week meet representative from the fire brigades union who say that over call have be take in seven hour on flood relate issue alone pay tribute to they do he agree that there should be recognition of firefighter who carry out flooding rescue which they do alongside all their other duty even though it be not statutory service so many people across so many organisation include fire and rescue work tirelessly to protect our community associate myself with the hon lady comment about the support provide by our local police and fire and rescue service mid bedfordshire be not an area at obvious risk of extreme flooding unlike other part of the county we lack major river beyond the river flit but our soil type range from the thin sandy soil of the greensand ridge to poorly drain clay soil each of which present its own flooding challenge our winter be get wetter and know that many family will like mine look at the damage do by those flood and worry that such flooding will become the norm congratulate my hon friend on secure this debate which be important for resident of bedfordshire he talk about not have river in his constituency but in north bedfordshire we be bless with two although this flooding be an extreme event flood issue have be persistent in place such as harrold clapham and great barford and most recently and quite devastatingly in tempsford and wyboston in my constituency do he welcome the initiative take up by the mayor of bedford tom wootton to get comprehensive approach from all the different agency that can help resident with their flood response and do he agree that that be model for assess flood risk in bedfordshire absolutely agree would love to join any of those meeting with mayor tom to support those effort in my ward of wixams and wootton commend the hon gentleman to whom speak beforehand for secure the debate conversation that people sometimes have be about the co ordination between different department as the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller allude to if the flooding of road and housing development area be know about in advance could well co ordination improve thing for our constituent for many people it might simply be about have sandbag available people need to know those thing maybe that would help certainly one of the lesson that have learn from the flooding in mid bedfordshire be that many statutory body be involve in flood response and resilience we need to work hard to ensure that those organisation work together it be so important that the government local authority and other learn the right lesson from those flood and hope that this debate can play role in guide that conversation first let reflect on the direct impact on constituent in mid bedfordshire hundred of resident have take the time to describe for the huge loss that they have suffer and thank they for take the time to do so while try to recover from flood damage emma from marston moretaine who fill in my recent flooding survey tell our property be completely soak front and back we see water rise and beside the path at our house there be gush water we have to call for help water come in through the side and foundation and in the end there be nothing we could do caroline from flitwick also take the time to share her experience severe flooding of my property require full water removal from my home and severe repair be currently stay with family but have to relocate for minimum of month whilst repair be do rita from harlington explain that we have internal flooding start at be with sewerage come up from manhole cover inside our garage we contact anglian water by am we could shower or flush the toilet as it be gurgle back up then the rain come the front drive be deluge we have neighbour help with bucket and pump try to get the water off our property it be fighting battle the water reach the front door and come into the property be flood be not just an inconvenience it be expensive and it be heartbreaking for family to see their valuable some of they irreplaceable wash away shortly after the flooding take the time to visit dozen of local business include disco licious in gravenhurst maulden garden centre and the dog house day care centre which be also in maulden those business together with many other have experience severe financial loss and in some case have see many year of hard work and investment wash away before their eye our farmer have be some of the bad hit with severe and significant flooding report at several local farm include at moreteyne retreat smallholding that have be impact hugely by floodwater flow from the in the aftermath of that flooding have learn that of the uk floodplain be agricultural land flooding can destroy whole crop yield waste month of work and threaten the livelihood of our farmer in many case at the same time as they see their home devastate by floodwater my hon friend have mention landowner and farmer he will be well aware of the internal drainage board which do such vital work to protect land and require the resource to do so the previous government commit million to drainage board but we have yet to see that money deliver by the current administration we also need long term solution to the funding of idb so that local authority be not put under undue pressure by have to fund those drainage board themselves thank my right hon friend for make that point he have steal my thunder because be go to make that exact point later in my speech so will skip over it when get to that section say it again perhaps will say it again england have suffer its second bad harvest on record with persistent wet weather and waterlogge field risk put our farmer out of business over the medium to long term my hon friend be make an excellent speech build on that point many of our farmer not only across bedfordshire but across the whole of the country be face their second serious crop loss in grow period do my hon friend agree that it be incredibly frustrating that despite the last conservative government have allocate million through the farming recovery fund many farmer who urgently need that money money that be guarantee to get out of the door be not yet receive it from the new administration my hon friend be exactly right it be very frustrating know that constituent who farm in my constituency be incredibly frustrated that funding will not be make available the persistent wet weather be disaster not only for farmer but for all of we because it impact yield and quality result in high food price and threat to national food security the government need to take action recognise that farmer in bedfordshire be businesspeople but also that they provide public benefit by take flooding that would otherwise flow into our town and village hope the minister will work with colleague to design scheme to properly recognise the contribution our farmer make by allow their field to flood and to remunerate they for that contribution our local council as councillor myself refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests have do fantastic work to support resident they have be force to pick up the piece and the bill to manage the response and now to put thing right they have not get everything right far from it but they have step up during this emergency and provide significant resource to keep people safe particularly the most vulnerable our household business farmer and council now need the government to step up and do their bit by release fund to support our community to recover and improve resilience the minister have discretion in this area and be surprised to receive response to write question this afternoon suggest that the flooding be not at sufficient scale to be consider exceptional enough to release recovery funding perhaps the minister will address that point in her closing remark be concerned that the government fail to appreciate the significant but localise impact of this particular flooding event my constituent want and deserve support perhaps the most high profile victim of our recent flooding be the which be close for week after more than million litre of water collect in dip in the road at marston moretaine national highways have work hard around the clock to reopen the road but as we look at lesson learn significant question must be ask about how we get here how major road connect bedford to the build this century can have be build down into the ground in historic floodplain which of course be prone to flooding it be design in such way that it regularly flood little but be build with flooding mitigation insufficient to deal with the kind of flooding that could become all too common in the year ahead as this government look to build similar infrastructure in the year ahead we must heed the warning of the and build in way that be protect from not the flooding of yesterday but the flooding of tomorrow road be not the only area where problem with ineffective infrastructure have exacerbate the impact of flooding on my resident in mid bedfordshire the block drain report right across mid beds in place like lower shelton flitwick cranfield harlington and maulden significantly increase the likelihood of surface water flooding clear the drain regularly if not the sole solution represent common sense to my constituent and be quick answer to mitigate at least some of the risk they want to see the schedule of maintenance improve materially leaf fall every autumn and block drain not every three year and utility company dig up road and fill drain with mud and tarmac only to leave they to be clear by the council in its three yearly cycle this simply be not good enough and it be put property and live at risk therefore call on the government to urgently consider introduce new statutory duty on local authority to clear drain and culvert regularly back by central funding at the budget to ensure that council have the resource they need also urge the government this be the point that my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes raise to look at the way that internal drainage board be fund to ensure that they have the resource they need to manage local flood risk ask the minister to commit to meet and interested colleague to discuss how that might be achieve in leicestershire we have lot of landowner who should be do more to help alleviate flooding unfortunately local authority have very limited power to compel they to act do my hon friend agree that more need to be do to bolster the power of local flood authority which be invariably upper tier council thank my hon friend for that intervention agree that that be something the government should be look at during the recent flooding be appal to learn that drain and sewer in the new town of wixams be overload with surface floodwater seventeen year after construction begin in wixams the drainage structure should be adequate to accommodate many more house than have so far be build urge the minister to join in press anglian water to take urgent action to expand its sewerage and drainage structure wixams be merely the most obvious example of problem that resident be see repeatedly with development house by house development by development infrastructure be fail to keep pace while an individual development might not be enough to overwhelm the system or cause knock on flooding impact the accumulate weight of development be create huge problem across the country include in maulden in my constituency where development have creep gradually up the slope of the greensand ridge result in water have few place to stop and soak so that it instead surge down into the village while the flooding infrastructure for these new development might in theory be sufficient for planner to justify development planning be fail to cope with the demand place on it by multiple and interconnected development which be pile pressure on to network and our natural environment with the government set to review the planning system and ask for our town and village to take thousand of additional home implore the minister to work with colleague to deliver reform that require flooding authority to take wide system view of the impact of development we need to ensure that housing target do not put the delivery of new home over the habitability of housing stock or the safety and sustainability of our community thank the hon gentleman for give way and for secure such an important debate not only for his constituent but for all bedfordshire members present the point he be make be really important and be feel keenly by my resident in langford on southland rise where the failure of flood prevention measure put in place as part of new development mean that several of they have have catastrophic flooding in very short space of time over the past few week do he share my view that not only be consideration of flood risk through local and national planning framework clearly in need of review but we need to ensure that measure be in place for robust enforcement to ensure that the flooding mitigation measure that be include in new development actually work as it be claim they should thank the hon member for his intervention that story be feel and hear all across mid bedfordshire and agree with the point he make as starting point would like the government to consider urgently introduce secondary legislation to bring into effect schedule to the flood and water management act the minister smile so she perhaps have point to make on that when she wind up understand from recent answer to my write question that the minister want to be mindful of the impact of over regulation on developer but build home in way that increase the flood risk in our town and village do nothing to alleviate the housing crisis we must also consider the benefit of nature and nature base solution natural upstream solution would help capture water and absorb some of the bad impact of flooding the bedford and milton keynes waterway park be great local example of project that have the potential to remove water during flooding and indeed to deliver water when it be most need during drought and we must press ahead and deliver it at pace in addition we need the government to look again at their plan to designate inferior quality area of the countryside for development and instead commit to bold strategy of restore nature and in so do create natural flood defence for our town and village in our town and village themselves would like the government to commit to natural regeneration programme use tree and nature to create sponge city by enhance drainage to prevent surface water flooding will conclude with final lesson that hope the minister will reflect on my constituent be disappoint that while she take the time to visit those in nearby leighton buzzard and to observe the impact of flooding there our town and village in mid bedfordshire receive no attention from the government at all with major road close and substantial number of house and business impact have the flooding in mid bedfordshire be concentrate in single major urban area have no doubt that we would have attract some specific focus have raise question with the minister and the department that remain unanswered urge the government to remember that rural area be impact by flood too and that they should be properly serve by this government not an afterthought call the minister thank you madam deputy speaker and it be pleasure to see you in the chair thank the hon member for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson for secure the debate on this important matter and everyone who have contribute to the discussion start by sincerely express my sympathy with all the individual whose home and business have be impact by flood may have previously share with the house the impact on when in the city that represent be flood it be story for another day but be teach at the time and when the floodwater come in we have to evacuate flooding have devastating impact on people for long time afterwards include on their mental health so be very sympathetic to the hon gentleman as victim of flood himself realise it be not easy at all as the hon gentleman mention more than property be flood follow recent heavy rain across central and southern england the effect be feel particularly in community in bedfordshire northamptonshire oxfordshire shropshire buckinghamshire and north west london but more than property be protect by exist flood defence as he say visit the leighton buzzard area in bedfordshire on september to meet volunteer and local resident and see at first hand the impact of the flooding there know many people be now face month of disruption and upset be particularly strike by one of the lady meet who be in tear when go into her home she show what have be her beautiful home in which she have live for over year and on which she have spend lot of time and how it have just be ruin by the floodwater come in which she find absolutely devastating the hon gentleman be right to point out how this impact on vulnerable people hear story of an elderly lady have to be rescue and take away from her home absolutely pay tribute to humberside fire and rescue service sorry not just humberside be so used to say that but all the fire and rescue service for their work in rescue people also thank the hon gentleman for join the call that we have with the environment agency which be something new that have try since become minister it would simply be impossible for to visit everywhere so want to find other way to be as open and accessible as possible which be why we try this call we have about member of parliament on the call and it be way for hon member to get information directly from the environment agency so be grateful that he join it the minister and work together when she be on this side of the house so know she be true to her word my hon friend the member for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson very nobly think suggest that we ought to have meeting about idb this be critically important issue for many part of the country and be sure that small delegation of colleague could in the spirit that the minister have just describe have very productive discussion would she agree to that the right hon gentleman be so difficult to say no to how infuriate have experience this before yes we will that will be fine will be attend the internal drainage board conference so after have meet people there be happy to meet delegation to talk about idb can already hear my private office say you ve agree to another meeting minister and tell off be part of the call to which the minister refer on september be an mp in somerset and we request meeting we have the benefit of the somerset rivers authority which believe be unique in the country we need to wrestle with how we enable the environment agency the internal drainage board the council the river authority and every other agency to address the problem of flooding for people in somerset as well will she please ensure that her official make that meeting happen absolutely as the hon lady will be aware the flooding happen during recess and we have be back just one week it be all note down and if make promise stick to it so we will have that there be also innovation in the incident response from the environment agency find this quite interesting but that be perhaps my inner geek come out it launch drone flight over the flooded area to assess and monitor where have be flood and look for where there be blockage and fall tree in some of the waterway it be then able to send people out to remove they think that be clever way of cover as much area as possible especially in large rural area to see where it need to solve problem reiterate the government thank to the environment agency local responder and many other who work tirelessly to help community across the country deal with the local flood also pay tribute to our farmer as this be the bad two year in row of harvest that they have face and realise the impact that that have have on the mental health of many of they accept the frustration around the farming flood recovery fund and be afraid will have to give an equally frustrating answer which be that until the budget be announce there be not much more can say on that matter although realise that that will not offer people the reassurance they want at the moment where can offer reassurance be that know the national farmers union be keen to consider how the formula be calculate when it come to assess where flood defence be build at the moment be base on the number of property protect want to look at that formula know that have be call for over long time to see whether it be still the formula that we need and have commit to do that with the nfu pay tribute to few of the volunteer group meet in bedfordshire include the bedfordshire local emergency volunteer executive committee and particularly lady call june tobin and graham mountford who be fantastic it be brilliant to see how well the volunteer organisation be embed in the emergency response by the bedfordshire local resilience forum be also impress by the work of amya and what it be do to get young people involve in volunteering many young people be volunteer at meadow way community centre especially two impressive young teenage girl who tell that they want to come and help in the community they be there make tea and coffee for everybody and think that they deserve special mention in my speech be sure the hon member for mid bedfordshire also find many wonderful example of people help as have be mention it be flood action week what week to be talk about flooding if you will indulge for moment madam deputy speaker wish to reiterate few safety message around flood action week we be urge the public to know and understand their flood risk and to please sign up for flood alert if there be one thing each member of parliament can do it be encourage our constituent to sign up for flood alert if people have the time that mean they can get prepare we would also like people to look at prepare flood kit and have medication and essential if they be go to be away from home or ask to evacuate at short notice as well as think about what will happen with pet the environment agency have extensive guidance on what we can do to try to improve our flood resilience there be an event today which hope many member be able to attend the environment agency and flood re parliamentary drop in if people be unable to attend be sure they can email out the information for member to communicate to constituent reassure the hon member that flooding be one of defra five key priority the honest truth be that we have inherit flood defence at their bad since the condition rating of key flood defence in england be at that be the low it have be in year which be clearly concern as we go into another wet winter as have be mention because of that we have be move million extra to the urgent repair of some of those flood defence and we also have mobile asset have mobile pump and km of mobile flood defence by use knowledge around long term forecast we want to get those mobile resource into the area require but the situation be definitely far from ideal the previous government flood investment programme be unfortunately behind schedule and over budget be urgently review it to ensure we have flood programme that be fit for purpose and as have be mention have be look at how the formula work the hon member mention one of my favourite word which be suds or sustainable urban drainage system only people with this level of geekery get excited about that as well as schedule of the flood and water management act be pleased he point out that it date from have still not be enact it be important that we look at sustainable urban drainage as he mention the ministry of housing communities and local government be do review of how the whole planning system work and it will come as no surprise to he that be push from the defra end of thing on how we can ensure that the home we build be flood proof now and in the future and importantly do not contribute or add to flood risk within an area those be two important issue the priority for the hon member be his constituency but we must bear in mind that water be tricky thing that do not obey constituency or national border therefore as have be point out if we want to tackle flooding sometimes the answer be literally far upstream enjoy hear he mention natural flood management solution which be another thing get excited about we have nature crisis so if we can deliver something that not only deliver protection from flooding but increase nature be that not wonderful thing to do be huge fan do not think the answer to everything should always be more concrete although at time of course we need those hard flood defence it be important to look at catchment base approach to how we handle this where we can look at slow the flow in some area or move water out more quickly in other the hon member also mention the be stick on that road as well after visit the flooded area in leighton buzzard realise could not get lift back to london because euston station be shut end up try to get lift from someone up to peterborough to make my way back up to hull and be stick on diversion from the feel his pain as fellow victim of that particular closed road the environment agency estimate that million will be invest in bedfordshire to increase flood resilience as the hon member rightly say for many area surface water be the problem so many of the scheme provide will be small scale surface water solution interruption be get the nod to hurry up okay will speed on we can continue much of this discussion at later date to conclude reiterate that this government will act to ensure that people be well protect from flooding in the first place we be determined to turbocharge the delivery and repair of flood defence to improve drainage system and to develop natural flood management solution we be invest more than billion this year to scale up national resilience through build new and improve exist flood defence the government be review the exist programme to get it back on track after the pace slow due to the impact of inflation and delay in the supply chain the flood resilience taskforce which we set up and which have already meet include the department for environment food and rural affairs the ministry of housing communities and local government the home office the cabinet office the environment agency the met office local resilience forum the mayoral office emergency responder and the national farmers union it will meet again in january emergency service the ea local authority voluntary organisation and departments stand ready to support affected community in any future flooding flooding be personal and priority for and will work tirelessly to make our community more resilient to flooding question put and agree to house adjourn
