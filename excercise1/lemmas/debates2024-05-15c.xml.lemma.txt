woman health while we have have woman health strategy for two year labour run wales have no health plan for woman call the shadow minister research show that one in woman with menopausal symptom have leave work due to lack of support in some case this will have be due to discrimination woman experience menopause know that this be because of their age and sex but the law do not protect they on that combine basis why not the equality act already protect woman on the basis of sex age and disability it be this government who be change the experience of menopause by roll out woman health hub in

year of particular concern be an area of beautiful field near west hall where more than constituent have write back to in recent week express their deep concern about the lack of provision of local infrastructure and the potential effect on the local environment my resident and will fight on but do the prime minister agree that labour proposal to concrete over vast swathe of the green belt in surrey and the south east would be complete calamity my hon friend be absolutely right unlike both the liberal democrats and labour who believe in top down target that would decimate the green belt we believe in local people have say over their local community that be why we be ensure that we make good use of brownfield land and that we conserve and enhance our precious countryside for generation to come we now come to the leader of the opposition on monday the prime minister treat we to his seventh relaunch in month he vow to take on the danger that threaten the country so it be good to see the minister for common sense immediately take up that mantle by announce vital crackdown on the gravest of threat colourful lanyard meanwhile in the real world after year of tory government the prison system be in chaos do the prime minister think that his decision to let prisoner out day early make our country more secure civil service impartiality be an important principle that we be right to support perhaps the right hon and learn gentleman could ask his chief of staff about that what do on monday be outline the serious security threat that our country face from an axis of authoritarian state russia poison people on our street china target our democracy and iranian proxy fire on british ship yet he will not back our plan to increase defence spending and we all know why especially since the deputy leader and the shadow foreign secretary vote to scrap our nuclear deterrent it be clear that you simply can not trust labour with our country security appreciate that the prime minister have be busy on the frontline of the war against lanyard he must have miss that be the first to call for on defence spending the last time that happen be under the last labour government it need credible plan not his fantasy economic be disappointed to see that version of the prime minister time in office do not extend as far as answer question or give any information on those prisoner he be release early basic detail such as how many where be they and what crime have they commit will he at least guarantee that none of the criminal who he be instruct prison to release early be consider high risk there be strict eligibility criterion in place with exclusion base on public safety no one would be put on the scheme if they be deem threat to public safety the right hon and learn gentleman talk about but if he think that be important think he just stand up and acknowledge that it be the right thing to do we have fully fund plan to deliver an increase in defence spending he and his party have refuse to match that commitment just like his billion fully fund if anyone be look for the perfect metaphor for this shambolic government we see it on monday the prime minister wake up decide his late rebrand be mr security but within hour the tory party be be investigate for accidentally publish the personal detail of hundred of people he must be the only tech bro brother in the country who can not work debit card or send an email interruption but he have not answer my question so will try again be any of the prisoner he be currently let out early consider to be high risk the right hon and learn gentleman just show spectacularly why he be just not fit to lead this country into the future this country have proud tradition of lead the world we lead the world when it come to the industrial revolution but if he be around he would have probably call james watt the steam bro what we be do be prepare the country for the future he talk about the prison scheme let be crystal clear no one would be put on the scheme if they be deem threat to the public offender be subject to the tough of licensing condition and if those condition be break they be back in prison for considerably long but what be his record on this he vote against tough sentence for violent criminal he actually oppose new power for the police to tackle violent crime and vote against new law that have arrest criminal people smuggler the message be crystal clear he can not be trust to keep this country safe appreciate that all this rebranding have take all the prime minister time but he may want to read the recent inspection report into lewes prison on this topic which have ask he twice about it document on page high risk prisoner be release at short notice without sufficient planning page state high risk prisoner have his release date bring forward despite have history of stalk domestic abuse and restraining order in the report word he be risk to child do the early release of stalker domestic abuser and those consider risk to child sound like the work of someone who be make the country more secure as say no one should be put on the scheme if they be threat to the public let be crystal clear it do not apply to anyone serve life sentence anyone convict of serious violent offence anyone convict of terrorism or anyone convict of sex offence crucially in contrast to the system labour put in place governor in the prison service have an absolute lock so that no one be put on the scheme who should not be labour scheme let out thousand upon thousand of violent offender on to our street and even two terrorist thankfully we have toughen up sentencing against those criminal with new legislation but the right hon and learn gentleman vote against it well be glad to hear that those on life sentence be not be release early the prime minister may not think that release domestic abuser be problem but labour have repeatedly call for domestic abuser to be exempt from the scheme to release prisoner early his government have shamefully ignore those call now that we have the evidence that domestic abuser be be release early the lewes report will he finally change course and back labour call have be crystal clear there be an absolute governor lock on people who be put on the scheme in contrast to the last labour scheme prisoner be let out with no supervision no electronic tag in fact offender be let be violent lead to multiple murder commit we fix that system when it come to this question not only be we build the big prison programme in history but we be deploy rapid deployment cell on the conservative benches we understand the importance of prison unlike one of his front benchers who say prison do prevent crime it be always the same with the labour party soft on crime and soft on criminal the prime minister be literally let criminal out early the only answer to the question that have ask whether domestic abuser should be exempt from his early release scheme from anyone who be serious about security be yes perhaps the most ludicrous part of the prime minister speech on monday be when he say that he would not accept the idea that any of the problem people be face have be cause by year of conservative government he will not say how many prisoner the government have release early he will not say whether they be burglar abuser or stalker he will not say where they be or what support their victim be get yet he think he have the right to tell people that they can not blame his government for any of it do he not think that rather than confiscate lanyard like some jump up milk monitor he should stop issue get out of jail free card to prisoner who be consider to be risk to child another week with no idea and absolutely no plan for the country the opposition have have year to think about nothing but the future but all they can do be talk about the past be surprised that the leader of the opposition do not bring up what have happen in the week since we last meet statistic have confirm that we have have the joint fast growth rate in the this year the bank of england have say that the economy have turn corner ey have say that our growth be impressive and the chief economist at the independent office for national statistics have say that the economy be go gangbuster the shadow chancellor may want to copy and paste their comment into her next speech or do she think that they be all gaslighte the british public too while understand the need to upgrade our broadband infrastructure it can not be right that company call brsk be propose to erect telegraph pole at the squirrels estate in hayley green in my constituency the resident be opposed to these proposal which go against the guidance do the prime minister agree that brsk should abandon its proposal that there should be review of permit development right in relation to this type of infrastructure and that he should give ofcom more power to investigate breach thank my hon friend for rightly champion the view of his constituent on this important topic network operator must follow legal obligation when deploy their network and ofcom can in fact investigate report of failure to follow those obligation know that the minister for data and digital infrastructure my hon friend the member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez meet representative of the sector and ofcom recently to raise concern about report of poor pole siting and ask operator to share infrastructure and will ask she specifically to give my hon friend more detailed update call the leader of the scottish national party on monday the prime minister outline what he consider to be extremist threat to our society and in do so he actively compare north korea iran and russia with those people in scotland who believe in independence so can ask he to rise once to the standard befit his office and apologise for those puerile and pathetic remark that be not what say but will say to the hon gentleman that his party be indeed threat to the integrity of the united kingdom hate to remind he that that be literally its entire purpose when the people of scotland accept the referendum result in it be the snp that do it go on create minister for independence focus on constitutional wrangling and ignore the need of the people education standard be fall and taxis be rise it be the right hon gentleman who should finally do the right thing end the obsession with independence and put the need of the scottish people first let we be clear what the prime minister do be not just equate my colleague and to dangerous despot across the world he proactively compare almost half the scottish population to war criminal like vladimir putin and he do so as their prime minister as the man who represent they on the world stage and as the man who on these isle be task with defend their liberty and their democracy we know that his sorry time in office be rapidly come to conclusion but be this really how he want to be remember as ever the right hon gentleman be distract from the actual record of what the snp be do in scotland this obsession with independence mean that scottish schoolchildren be be let down plummet down international league table the scottish nhs be the only place in the united kingdom where funding be actually fall in real

the nhs for the future thirty thousand palestinian death be not enough to move this prime minister to end arm sale to israel the killing of british aid worker be not enough to move the prime minister to end arm sale it even seem that an all out assault on rafah with all the death and destruction that would entail would not be enough for he unlike the us so just what on earth would be enough finally to move this prime minister into the same position as the majority of the british public and end arm sale to israel point out to the hon gentleman that unlike the us the uk government do not directly sell arm to israel and neither do the uk government offer any military lethal aid package to israel as the us do he should not conflate these issue as part of the government robust arm

bank branch bank loss hollow out community and be an impediment to small business cash access uk have say that it will roll out banking hub by the end of the year and the financial conduct authority

about the introduction of the law on transparency of foreign influence the uk be close friend of georgia and as such we call for calm and restraint on all side we hope to continue to work with georgia with which we have deep and long stand partnership and to support the legitimate aspiration of the georgian people as they pursue free sovereign and democratic future thank you mr speaker for grant uq on this important issue it be much appreciated also thank the minister for his helpful response and all right hon and hon member who have stay in the chamber we wake up to report of ukraine attempt to push back in the kharkiv region and then hear the russian defence ministry claim that its air force have destroy long range missile know as atacms army tactical missile system that ukraine military launch at crimea overnight the medium reporting may have settle down but the situation there be as volatile as it have ever be and the ripple effect across the entire region continue secretary blinken from president biden administration be visit ukraine to give it physical and military assistance and encouragement the minister will know that georgia be also push forward legislation as russia try to restore its empire of old and control all its former satellite state the russian threat be clearly undermine democratic process in the entire region understand and agree with the uk clear public stance of support for ukraine and congratulate the government and the minister on what have be do and what will be do in future but the situation demand further action be keen to get the minister response on what that further action will be will he make clear what far enhanced help we can give to facilitate the democratic process aside from our vital military aid to the region the war that begin in be on the precipice how can we ensure that the result be victory for democracy and freedom not simply for ukraine but for georgia and for all of we globally be grateful to the hon gentleman for ask an extremely good and valid question that put the issue of ukraine in regional context in the context of the influence that russia have seek to exert over its former satellite state he be right that the frontline in ukraine be turbulent full picture be yet to emerge but we can be certain of our continued resolve to ensure that our ukrainian friend prevail that be the unavoidable direction of travel the ongoing visit of secretary blinken remind we of the remarkable heft and scale of western support in which we play our part very proudly the resolute support of the friend of ukraine will help it to prevail despite turbulence and russia attempt to create new dynamic on very turbulent frontline the hon gentleman ask cogent question about georgia he be right that georgia know more than any other country about the depredation of russian invasion follow the horrify event of we be clear that georgia have the sovereign right to pursue its own autonomous path if it seek to turn its eye to the west towards nato membership and maybe membership of the european union it be the sovereign right of georgia to forge its own destiny we will continue to co operate in earnest and sincere partnership with the georgians with whom we have very meaningful defence relationship have have the pleasure of visit tbilisi twice as foreign office minister and of see the tremendous institutional work that we do with the georgians who have fine defence tradition call the chair of the intelligence and security committee do the government share my view that just as soviet failure in afghanistan lead to considerable extent towards the downfall of the soviet empire putin failure in ukraine could have similar effect on his future and ambition and that it be no coincidence that this renew russian attack take place before the aid that america have belatedly decide to give ukraine have have chance to arrive the answer be yes one can see the extraordinary mobilisation of the russian state and society and the huge expenditure that putin be have to incur to maintain momentum in his fail military operation as confirmation of long term weakness we now come to the shadow minister thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for secure this urgent question it be day since putin begin the full scale illegal invasion of ukraine russia have open renew offensive in the kharkiv region but ukrainians be continue to fight with huge courage the uk be totally unite in support of ukraine the shadow defence secretary and shadow foreign secretary be in kyiv for the last two day and reaffirm that labour commitment to ukraine be ironclad if putin win he will not stop at ukraine that be why the government have have and will continue to have labour full support for military aid to ukraine and for reinforce nato ally across eastern europe every commitment of uk military aid since putin invade have have labour full support and that will continue with general election later this year there may be change in government but there will be no change to britain resolve in stand with ukraine confront russian aggression and pursue putin for his war crime on georgia we be deeply concerned by the increase pressure on civil society freedom and by the intimidation of protester the propose draft law be not in line with democratic value and risk take georgia away from the euro atlantic aspiration of the georgian people what discussion have the minister have with the us the eu and other regional partner on the late development in georgia be the uk put georgia on the agenda for the meeting in italy and the upcoming european political community meeting what step be he take with our ally to counter russian disinformation and hybrid activity in georgia and across the caucasus the western balkans and the rest of europe what support have be give to help ukraine build up its air defence to stop air and drone strike on critical infrastructure especially in the kharkiv region how much of the money commit to the international fund for ukraine have be spend and how much be leave to be spend the uk will stand with the ukrainians for as long as it take for they to win be glad that the hon gentleman point out the remarkable courage of our ukrainian friend in their effort to counter the new axis of advance in the kharkiv region and we sincerely welcome the continued cross party support for ukraine the hon gentleman express concern which we share about the new law pass in georgia that be on the agenda of our discussion with ally it be beyond my scope to comment on what might be on the agenda for the or the epc but it be certainly an issue of concern that we discuss with trust partner and we have do so very frequently recently huge amount of institutional effort from our side be go into counter disinformation across the entire region as well as in the western balkans and central asia the former so call satellite state of russia which have particular vulnerability to disinformation from the kremlin will not go into detail about that effort but it be significant piece of work and will continue to be important the hon gentleman ask good question about air defence we have gift thousand of unit of air defence to ukraine there will surely be more to come the uplift in financial support that we have announce will clearly be an issue for the ukrainians through our gift programme and air defence will feature heavily in that call the chair of the foreign affairs committee congratulate the hon member for strangford jim shannon on secure this important urgent question the brutalisation of peaceful ordinary georgians and the hospitalisation of opposition leader david katsarava be utterly shameful can the minister assure we that he will protest directly to the georgian government and call in the ambassador regard the abuse of the public that we be see on our screen daily on ukraine the fall of avdiivka at the start of this year be the shameful result of allied inaction on get ukraine what it need that fall on we we can not now see the same take place in kharkiv which be under assault for the reason set out already in this discussion can the minister please assure we that sufficient ammunition be reach the frontline now and update we on what we be do to procure sufficient artillery shell ukraine as ever need we to give it enough to win and not just to survive we of course express our concern about the direction of travel with regard to protest in georgia know that the foreign office have make representation to the ambassador here and will continue to keep watching brief on that issue my hon friend ask about kharkiv of course ammunition supply be central component of our effort both politically and in term of what we be gift and source we have give over unit of ammunition however we acknowledge that we must all in the coalition of friendly western nation mobilise to far great degree that be why we think that initiative come from the czech side and across all european and nato partner be important we must strain every sinew to ensure that the flow continue call the snp spokesperson those of we on the snp benches join the cross party support and congratulate the hon member for strangford jim shannon on secure the urgent question to follow the question from the chair of the foreign affairs committee on what more we can do for ukraine do the minister agree that now be the time for the uk to join other nato ally in support the czechia munition programme on top of what have already be provide on georgia the government state that their aim be to advance georgia euro atlantic integration through security cooperation and support for democratic reform give the dream party lurch away from democratic reform how stable be that integration and security co operation do the minister agree that it be time for the people of georgia to have their say on the dream party agenda we have not join the czech programme because it would replicate work that we be already do but we commend its activity and see it as part of broad solution to mobilise effort to increase the flow of munition so it be welcome clearly the political future of georgia be question for georgians themselves but we note that there be lively debate which have of course spill out on to the street of tbilisi about the direction of travel agree with the hon gentleman that the direction of travel whether euro atlantic or anything else should be function of the democratic expression of the people of georgia applaud the number of personnel train under operation interflex but do the minister support my call to extend that operation to train ukrainian female defender volunteer yes of course we will train whoever the ukrainians send we warn in that if we keep on feed the crocodile the danger be that we would be last on the menu that be why it be so important that we get the next step right over the next two year in make sure that putin do not win in ukraine two thing still perplex first why have we and our ally as united team not dramatically ramp up the production of the artillery that ukraine actually need secondly why have we yet to seize russian state asset sit in british and european bank to repurpose they for reparation to pay for the reconstruction of ukraine we be ramp up the production of artillery right across europe and in state beyond europe that be complex effort involve the military industrial base those step be in place and be confident that we will see an increase in supply the hon gentleman ask about state asset of course we want that to be the outcome but the route must be legal we in britain relative to the size of our army have give more military equipment to ukraine than anyone we have now give the ukrainians all our heavy artillery to help they fight kharkiv can not be allow to fall but let we be honest all the kit that the ukrainians need to have win this war already from to long range missile have be sit in american storage depot for two year when will we get it through to the occupant of the white house that if he carry on dither and the russians take kharkiv not only do the ukrainians lose but he lose too literally my right hon friend make pertinent and correct point of course we lead as hard as we could in the aftermath of the invasion and we lead the way with the critical provision of system such as nlaw the next generation light anti tank weapon historian will reflect on whether the month follow the invasion be an opportunity miss to give decisive advantage to our ukrainian friend but our focus now be on ensure that in the round and overwhelmingly the combined effect of the huge package from the united states as well as our and that of all friendly nation can ensure that the ukrainians maintain their defence and ultimately liberate their sovereign homeland some time ago ask the prime minister about our relationship with turkey we might have some issue with turkey but the fact remain that as it be geographically next door to georgia its strategic position be crucial furthermore turkey have important link with many of the player in this deeply dangerous situation what conversation be the foreign office have with ankara about resolve this situation think can answer on behalf of my cross departmental colleague by say that there be many conversation we recognise the centrality of turkey importance as strong nato ally and nation with tremendous military confidence it have also make remarkable contribution to the defence of ukraine sovereignty by the provision of the remarkable bayraktar weapon system welcome the fact that the minister say that the uk government want to continue work with georgia that be quite right but be he aware that jim the senior us state department official say yesterday that the relationship between the us and georgia could be at risk and review and that financial and travel restriction could be impose be it not the case that all that could be avoid if the georgian government drop the foreign agent law or at least amend it significantly my right hon friend who speak with authority be right in his analysis of course we note the us view and we have express our concern we will continue to use our strong relationship with the georgians to ensure that they amend for their own interest their behaviour leed sister city be kharkiv the people of leeds be gravely concerned that the invasion of kharkiv be imminent colleague have already ask about artillery shell which be in short supply but even bullet be in short supply what be the uk do to supply the ukrainian defence of kharkiv with bullet be we upscale humanitarian aid to kharkiv and utilise it for the evacuation of civilian who want to leave will the uk government supply additional visa for kharkivians who want to come to the uk the people of leeds be ready to welcome they into their home be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question now realise leeds be the sister city of kharkiv which be interesting we be put more money than ever before into lethal aid support for ukraine an additional million will take our support this year to billion and lot of that will go on munition but humanitarian aid be also significant and be an important part of the picture like any bully russia will advance if it feel that the west be not support ukraine the russians have see that we in the west have not be support ukraine enough because of the lack of ammunition go in for any soldier the supply of ammunition be as the minister be fully aware crucial to confidence and morale can we give the big possible push to ensure that what the americans have say be go to the frontline reach it see this morning that they say that some ammunition have already arrive have it already arrive and what be the timetable for the rest this be completely unfair on the armed force out there my right hon friend analogy of russia as bully be absolutely correct we be focus on increase ammunition supply my judgment be that the billion package from the us combine with our additional support will result in tangible improvement in the operational situation on the frontline as we know georgia alongside ukraine aspire to join nato do the minister agree therefore that it be important that georgia respect peaceful protest on ukraine with the russians close in on be within artillery range of kharkiv what military support can we deliver now to prevent russia from be able to bombard that city which would be catastrophic for the civilian population agree with my hon friend analysis of georgia nato aspiration that be clear the support we can give now be to continue our remarkable supply of lethal aid particularly with regard to air defence what putin be do in georgia now be exactly the same thing that he try to do in ukraine year ago yet unlike the american government the british government do not seem to be think of any recalibration at all with the current georgian regime which be beat up its own citizen in the street of tbilisi why have the georgian ambassador in london not at least be summon what action rather than just word have be take to make our view completely clear to the current georgian government that their behaviour and this legislation be unacceptable in truth those be question for my colleague in the foreign commonwealth and development office but our analysis be that the strong relationship we have with the georgians in the defence sector be an important mean of ensure that their direction of travel be positive one there be grow concern across central and northern europe about georgia will the minister have conversation with colleague in government to ensure that the commitment to nato of our partner across europe be increase to prepare for the undoubted expansionism that putin be currently engage in and that he will probably step up in the come month the answer be yes mr speaker of course the hon gentleman will have observe as have that the consequence of putin effort to demonstrate nato weakness have be exactly the opposite nato be now large and strong than it be before february we will lead the way in ensure that all member meet the investment require to be member of that tremendous defensive alliance congratulate the hon member for strangford jim shannon on secure this urgent question the united kingdom have lead the world in support ukraine militarily economically diplomatically and politically and as former minister with responsibility for sanction see the real impact that the united kingdom could have with its partner in work together on this issue there be however real loophole within the international strategy to cut off putin finance the united nations peacekeeping force of which we be member currently procure its military helicopter from russia so that money go back into putin pocket be the minister or the government aware of that fact and now that they be will the government raise it at the to urgently ensure we cut off putin finance be grateful to my hon friend for raise that point and will ensure that my colleague the minister with responsibility for sanction take it into account we be unite in our determination to support ukraine as it seek to defeat putin labour welcome the creation of new uk latvian drone capability coalition early this year and the uk commitment to spend million on drone for ukraine can the minister confirm when the first drone under that initiative will be deliver to ukrainian force very soon as chair of the all party parliamentary group on georgia have watch the demonstration in tbilisi with no little concern although have notice no new movement of georgia towards russia as some have be suggest whether culturally economically or militarily it would appear that the current georgian dream government be become more ready to use the apparatus of the state to suppress political dissent free speech and the medium sometimes with violence will my hon friend impress on his georgian counterpart as an ally and friend that this be not how democratic country behave if they wish to join western institution and participate as free democratic value country my hon friend be correct georgia must live up to the standard require if it be to be sincere about its democratic aspiration and we do make that point to our friend in georgia we be all rightly proud of the skill of our armed force personnel and the training that they be provide for ukrainians through operation interflex but understand that that programme be only designate up until this summer can the minister confirm that it will continue for as long as it be need wholeheartedly mr speaker our commitment to train our ukrainian ally be endure and of course we will always respond to the type and form of training that they themselves require event in the united states and the understandable focus on the conflict in gaza and the unacceptable loss of life there have lead some to argue that our support for ukraine be waver can the minister seek to put stop to that deliberate disinformation by set out that our support for ukraine be absolute that we stand in solidarity with the ukrainians in their fight against putin illegal aggression and that in some respect they be battle on our behalf because as we see putin aggression will not stop with ukraine give that will the minister also set out how we will ensure that the ammunition that be so desperately need get to the frontline as quickly as possible welcome the hon lady question by any measure our commitment to ukraine be significant and unwavering that be recently express by the increase in our annual support from billion of lethal aid to billion and by the year defensive alliance that the prime minister sign with president zelensky on his recent visit to kyiv thank my colleague and hon friend the member for strangford jim shannon for secure this urgent question what help and support be we as nation give to those country in eastern europe such as estonia that feel under threat from the potential threat of putin want to expand back into what be formerly russian territory that be very good question the support we be give be welcome those country as brother and sister country into the defensive nato alliance in our case we be very proud to have our enhance forward presence battle group in tallin and estonia any member who have visit that battle group as have know that there be tremendous esprit de corps generate by the tremendous joint defensive work carry out by our british soldier alongside their estonian ally bill presented delivery services drive licence requirements bill presentation and first reading standing order no mr barry sheerman support by debbie abrahams present bill to require person carry out delivery service by motorcycle or mop to hold full licence to provide for penalty for an employer who employ delivery rider who hold provisional licence and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time on friday june and to be print bill on point of order mr speaker it have be my honour to be the mp for hemel hempstead for the past year whenever have have the opportunity have always try to raise and honour the name of captain robert laurence nairac george cross my captain in the battalion grenadier guards he be lose or capture whatever way we want to describe it on the night of may we think although we do not actually know that he be murder the follow day today be the anniversary it be right and proper that this house acknowledge the work of our armed force particularly on op banner but we should recognise that captain nairac be different sort of officer in many way think we would all accept that for instance he break my nose for the first time while spar in the boxing ring must admit but he also leave six pint of guinness on the naafi bar at the end of the evening because give he good dig back that be what he be about he be in the armed force and in northern ireland because he want to make difference for the people of northern ireland that be something that this house should respect first may say that be grateful to the right hon gentleman for inform that he would raise this matter as he know it be not point of order for the chair but the house will understand why he want to put that point on record and he have do so eloquently as he have do in previous year far to that point of order mr speaker thank my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning who almost every year have visit the church of st mary de lode in gloucester in order to pay tribute to and commemorate the work do by captain nairac gc whose memory be also celebrate there through stain glass window in his honour be very grateful to my right hon friend for continue to raise this matter year after year once again that be also not point of order but it be certainly on the record child sexual abuse material digital devices motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to provide for power to require person to grant access to their digital device in the course of lawful inspection under the customs and excise management act where there be reasonable suspicion that the device may contain child sexual abuse material to provide that refusal to grant such access constitute an offence and for connected purpose begin by outline the scale of the problem this bill seek to tackle up to individual in the united kingdom represent sexual risk to child accord to the national strategic assessment we also know that of online offender be hand on abuser too one in four girl and one in six boy be sexually assault before the age of child sexual abuse material or csam be abundant online so much so that almost million unique csam file be know to uk law enforcement and the number be grow all the time the digital age have bring with it tremendous opportunity for advancement in many area communication have never be easy and the world have never be small but as the world have become small criminal network have grow large law enforcement be still have to play catch up and as result tragically unforgivably more and more child be become victim to sexual predator the uk border force be our first line of defence against people travel with the intent to cause harm whatever that may be its search power have be sufficient to stop terrorist and drug smuggler but they be not sufficient to stop child abuser that be because the law govern the scope of its search power be draft in the long before the digital age single photo take from one of today smartphone could easily exceed the entire capacity of even the high spec floppy disk then at the revolutionary cutting edge of computing it be an era when it be not even conceivable that sexual predator would be travel across border with potentially thousand of illegal photo and video in the palm of their hand the outdated law in question be the customs and excise management act it grant the power for border force agent to search an individual and their baggage to detect the import or export of prohibit good border force do not require reasonable ground to suspect that the individual be in possession of prohibit good to utilise this power of search in port environment while existing power permit border force to require an individual to present their baggage include their digital device those power do not extend to require person to open that baggage to unlock device if they refuse to do so when ask there be nothing that border force can do in previous decade csam would amount to stack of polaroid which be often unmistakable and readily detectable now all this material be carry digitally and often behind encryption software and passcode to expand on this point there have be several example of lone individual identify as possess belonging associate with the commission of sexual offence against child for example toy lubricant condom and child underwear in these circumstance where it be reasonable to suspect that the individual may be in possession of digital csam border force can not inspect the digital device unless the individual consent each time this happen we could be let dangerous abuser into the united kingdom undetecte as mention in my westminster hall debate on the same subject late last year even when notify it can take week for the police to trace an individual and there have be case where suspect have rap two or more young girl before be catch my bill give border force the power it need to prevent this under it an individual refuse to unlock their digital device would be subject to arrest for new offence of obstruction if an international passenger of any nationality arrive in or depart from the uk and border force reasonably suspect the individual to be involve in child sexual abuse border force officer will ask they to unlock their digital device so that they can perform scan to determine beyond any reasonable doubt the presence of csam as verify by the home office database if the individual complie the scan will take place and if content be detect the individual will be arrest under the act if they refuse they commit an offence and their device will be seize and forensically examine by the police or the national crime agency want to go into little more detail on how the technology now available would be use because know that some hon member will have concern about privacy the power to search device would be govern by standard operating procedure whereby an inspection would be undertake via scan not download that only search device memory for file code or hashtag associate with known csam file these code be hold on home office database contain nearly million unique file there would be no manual device inspection or collateral search this also mean that border force officer would not be subject to any horrific material themselves as they would likely have be in previous decade it be worth note that similar power already exist for the police in relation to terrorist material under schedule to the terrorism act with these new power border force would become full part of the multi agency response need to help prevent the proliferation of csam online it would also mean it could meet the recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse to increase proactive detection of previously unidentified person and therefore safeguard child from new or further harm mention early that over people in the uk present sexual risk to child what do not say be that very few of these individual have be identify with the new power that have outline border force will go from have near zero impact on locate offender to play an active role in prevent the sexual abuse of child furthermore it will be able to prevent potential first generation csam from make it on to the internet detection at the border can be starting point for further investigation such as identify other device or item hold at the suspect home and look into other offence

speak to the programme motion rise to speak to the programme motion which be table yesterday shortly before the rise of the house it relate to the consideration of hundred of amendment and new clause to serious and substantial bill indeed they relate to some of the most fundamental issue affect our constituent today there be debate on amendment and new clause that cover domestic abuse human trafficking and the transfer of prisoner to foreign prison yet the house be make aware of that only yesterday evening be sure that member across the house will have be up late try their good to prepare as be but my duty to my constituent compel to place on the record my shock and worry about what this mean not only for parliamentary democracy but for the quality of legislation that will be pass last week there be an absurd situation when we have deadline for table amendment and new clause yet we do not know what business the debate would cover then at my last count government amendment be table virtually at the last minute those be not unsubstantial or merely technical amendment but include measure relate to new offence that would have potentially significant and wide reach consequence for our civil liberty and could even result in imprisonment these measure include further power for the police to exercise without accountability do not need to remind the house that many of our constituent be very worried about the power that the police already have and how they use they it be no secret that trust in the police be already low particularly among woman survivor and people from diverse background whatever the different view across the house surely there be consensus that measure of such significance which could have severe and potentially life change consequence for our constituent should not be pass without appropriate scrutiny and without many of we even know of their existence accordingly there have certainly be very little public awareness or debate as members of parliament we have profound duty to those who elect we regard the scrutiny of legislation this be not only about have function democracy this be about have workable and function law there be many question about impact assessment and we do not know what the full disability and equality implication will be for example government new clause prohibit wear or otherwise use an item for the purpose of conceal identity in locality designate by the police before even get to fundamental assessment of the measure as whole there be many question and point of clarity that my constituent would want at the very least to be publicly establish for example how will the provision impact muslim woman who wear the hijab or the niqab because the phrasing refer to use an item wholly or mainly for such purpose in closing let place on the record my alarm at this government now fairly frequent tabling of large number of amendment on report and at the short notice compress time for debate and scrutiny and what many of we experience as utter confusion regard timetabling that be dangerous precedent to set and it be not in the spirit of parliamentary democracy urge the government to withdraw the extra substantial amendment and allow for the proper democratic sensible and transparent scrutiny that our constituent expect of we rise to follow the hon member for poplar and limehouse apsana begum understand the point she make but we would of course want to ensure that people listen to the debate be aware that there be two day of debate on the bill this week and next week which hope will afford some of the scrutiny that she be rightly call for gently suggest to those on the treasury bench that they may want to hold one to one meeting with those of we who be interested in number of the area on which the government have now table amendment just couple of day before this important report stage so that we can get proper understanding of what they be try to do it would perhaps have be

begum and my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller and make careful note the fact that this debate be split over two day may have contribute to that but have listen carefully and will take that point away it be an honour again to open this debate and bring this important bill back to the house on report its focus be on counter develop criminal threat intercept serious organise crime and protect vulnerable victim thank member across the house for their constructive engagement on the bill as well as the police lead academic practise lawyer and campaign group some of whom appear before we in committee they have all contribute to the bill development there be many topic to discuss today and look forward to hear the view of member the government be bring forward number of amendment that we believe be appropriate and necessary to punish offender and enhance the protection that victim deserve briefly will explain the key government amendment start with those about which anticipate there will be no dispute namely the extension to northern ireland of our new spike measure in clause and the statutory aggravating factor for groom activity in relation to child sexual offence in clause new clause provide for equivalence in sentencing for terrorist offender between england and wales and northern ireland as consequence of the irregularity that be identify in the case of perry government new clause extend the time limit for the unduly lenient sentence scheme and will extend the overall time limit to six week request must still be submit by any prospective appellant to the attorney general office within the usual day but the attorney general office will have an additional day to consider whether the case be appropriate for submission to the court of appeal in recent year the number of case refer to the law officers have increase in part due to well awareness of the scheme we consider it to be in the interest of justice that each application be give due care and attention even when it be submit close to the day deadline and we believe that the new clause be proportionate way of achieve that on attendance at sentencing hearing change have be initiate already in the legislation in response to public concern about high profile case such as those of lucy letby jordan mcsweeney and thomas cashman all of whom refuse to attend their sentencing hearing do my hon friend agree that such case which have rightly gain huge amount of public traction be one where it be appropriate for the government to be make further announcement and put in measure at this stage agree with that sentiment entirely we be already create an express statutory power at clause to compel an offender to attend the sentencing hearing if they have be convict of crime for which the maximum sentence be life but we have also listen to those concerned about offence that might not be catch by that power confirm that the government have table amendment to to extend the measure to all offence that might attract maximum sentence of year or more be grateful to the lord chancellor the minister and other ministers for listen to the case make on second reading for extend the power have case in my constituency where an offender be convict of sexually assault child under which carry year sentence they hide away in their cell and do not come to court under the original provision they would not have be capture but under these amendment they will be and welcome that thank my hon friend because the speech he give on second reading play major role in the change we be introduce today reassure he that the change bring into scope most sexual assault case terrorist case and racially aggravate offence and confirm to he that the specific case he raise on second reading would have be bring into scope by the change for which he have campaign remind the house that the sanction for non attendance at sentencing hearing be up to maximum of another two year in custody government new clause create an offence of create sexually explicit deepfake of an adult without their consent member will be aware that the sharing of intimate image whether real or fake be already proscribe under the online safety act we consider that we can not complete the task of protect people principally woman unless we add the creation of pseudo image or deepfake to that package of protection we be the first national legislature to take this step if be wrong about that we be among the first and we do so because we recognise the inherent risk pose by the creation of these image both to the individual depict and to society more widely know that the minister will have give thought to this but do she agree that there be problem not just with deepfake sexual image but more widely with deepfake image that purport to show individual and potentially even member of this house do and say thing that they have not and that have no sexual connotation whatever be grateful to my right hon friend for raise that point we be encounter rapidly change world of deepfake image that can be use for the purpose of manipulate voice to try to influence political attitude and choice have to make it clear that the new clause be confine only to the creation of sexually explicit image however it be my hope humbly express at this dispatch box that it may provide gateway and lever for the development of more law in this area and thank she for her intervention particularly thank the minister for this new clause it obviously only cover adult because produce sexual content of child be already illegal but be tell that since the government announce their intention to move the new clause apple and google have already remove from their app store number of app that be enable user to produce deepfake nude those application have be use to create indecent image of child as well as of adult disable those app have already help to keep the public safe and to significantly improve the safeguarding of child just by table the new clause the government have already force the industry to act in the uk that be music to our ear it be not lose on we that within day of make the announcement two of the major deepfake or nudify site have block access to uk user in anticipation of the fact that even the act of use that site would become criminal offence under our impending legislation thank the minister for her personal championing of this new clause as she know the science innovation and technology committee recommend it and we benefit from seminar conduct with the campaigner that glamour magazine bring together to bring the experience of people right across the country to focal point they deserve credit for have bring this issue to the house as do the minister for champion it so brilliantly and bring the new clause today have to thank the team at glamour magazine because they lead an excellent campaign be halfway through try to make the change myself when become aware of it but read the material that they put out it totally chime with our objective and know that my right hon friend welcome the team to parliament just few week ago intimate image abuse be an important issue to be deal with can the minister explain why she have not approach it in the same way as her colleague approach it in the online safety bill it be long fight battle to have the online safety bill recognise consent as pivotal yet she have choose not to take that approach at this stage which think many will find disappointing want to be crystal clear that under the new clause the offence be commit if the pseudo image be create without the consent of the person who be the subject that be at subsection and of propose new section let talk for moment about intent the new clause differ from some of the content in the online safety act it do not relate to intimate image such as person wear swimsuit but apply to sexually explicit image which be define in legislation it require not only that the image be sexually explicit and be create without the consent of the subject matter but that it be do for the purpose of sexual gratification or with the intent of cause humiliation alarm or distress gently say that similar measure be debate in the bill committee think it be table by the hon member for nottingham north alex norris and he will recognise that the intent of the provision that the government have adopt be the same as the opposition be aware of what my right hon friend the member for basingstoke be say about the base event perhaps can allay her concern by simply say this it be novel new measure for any government to take she make sensible and compelling argument on this point and hope she will feel reassure if we take an iterative approach for the time be she will recall that the law commission recommend that we do not introduce legislation at all and will come on to say little about that it be right to say that other country be look at we carefully the justice secretary be at the in venice just last weekend and other justice ministers have notice that we be make this change and be observe carefully we be make this change because we recognise the inherent risk pose by these image and that the offence be overwhelmingly target at woman predicate on an absence of consent as such we consider it gateway to more serious offending we make some point by way of clarification we carefully consider the law commission recommendation in its excellent report on intimate image abuse which have inform much of our recent work although respectfully on this we have diverge from its point of view in response to some of its concern would like to reassure the house we recognise that the amendment could criminalise young people particularly teenage boy to reduce the risk of over criminalisation we believe that we have set pragmatic parameter creation alone will be non imprisonable offence although it will incur potentially unlimited fine the offence of creation alone would not attract notification requirement mean that the offender will not be place on the sex offender register as hon member will know all of that change if the image be share victim of that offence will be entitle to automatic anonymity in line with all the other sexual offence and they will also be eligible for special measure at trial we be delighted to see major deepfake website withdraw from the united kingdom and we encourage the other to follow their lead turn to government new clause which introduce statutory aggravating factor for manslaughter involve sexual conduct the clause correspond to and potentially should be read in conjunction with section of the domestic abuse act which say that it be not defence to argue that victim consent to the infliction of serious harm for the purpose of sexual gratification we have long hold concern about killing of this nature where by definition the victim can not give an account of consent yet on occasion the court have implicitly seek to categorise the killing as consequence of sexual choice as oppose to the consequence of the development of social norm base on structural inequality we invite the eminent criminal barrister clare wade kc to consider the issue specifically in her domestic homicide review last year she say that case of this nature must be view through the prism of coercive control and that the policy underpin law ought to consider the wide harm which emanate from the behaviour which can and do lead to this category of homicide we agree and we be increase the punishment for degrading and abusive conduct of this nature follow careful consultation with the sentencing council we be table statutory aggravate factor so that sentence for manslaughter involve sexual conduct must be more severe it will cover all case where the act be directly attributable to sexual conduct want to provide the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips with one point of reassurance she will know from all her work and particularly the research conduct by we can consent to this and the team that of all these homicide almost be strangulation case know that that be not the point that she wish to make with her amendment but there be some overlap on parental responsibility as hon member will be aware the government have already amend the children act via the victims and prisoners bill to provide for the automatic suspension of parental responsibility in case where one parent kill the other we be make an amendment to develop the law far provide that where father be convict of child rape parental responsibility that he may have for any child will be automatically suspend pay tribute to the right hon and learn member for camberwell and peckham ms harman think that she be in the war at the moment for the way in which she have present this issue she have advance the compelling argument that we have long establish principle to protect child from sex offender by place people on the sex offender register and protect they from work with child but while we have measure to protect other people child the same protection do not exist for the child of the offender unless the mother go to the family court to remove his right also pay tribute to sanchia berg the journalist who reveal this issue through her work and highlight the practical obstacle that some mother have face in make this application as well as other family who have talk about their experience include via their member of parliament one example be my hon friend the member for meriden saqib bhatti be not sure if he be in his place the father will still be able to apply to the family court to have the suspension of his parental responsibility lift but it be obviously fair to assume that if he have be convict of child rape such an application be unlikely to succeed we have also include clear requirement for this measure to be review after it have be in place for three year it be pleasure to see in the public gallery some of the family who have champion this issue in the west midland be right in thinking really hope that be not that this measure cover only those convict of the rape of child not other sexual offence against child and child age or over the hon member be correct simply want to say again that this be novel power that we be extend to crown court judge who typically do not have any knowledge of family law matter or family law background once again we think it be right that we take an iterative approach there be dialogue between the mother of the house and the lord chancellor on this point and she agree with the approach do not want to put word in her mouth and be keenly aware of her absence when she should be speak to her new clause but believe that she be satisfied with where we have get to commend the new clause and urge all colleague to give it their support turn next to new clause and and new schedule commend my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for his excellent campaign and dedication to craft new offence must also mention my hon friend the members for eastbourne caroline ansell and for hertford and stortford julie marson who also come to see and make really compelling argument when it come to cuckooing although there be range of current offence that can be apply the government have listen carefully to concern about weakness in the exist legal framework new clause therefore provide for bespoke criminal offence to tackle cuckooing the offence criminalise the control whether exercise by mean of coercion or otherwise over another person home for the purpose of use it as base to commit specify criminal activity the specify offence which be list in the new schedule include drug offence sexual offence and offensive weapon crime stress that that be non exhaustive list which the secretary of state can amend as mode of criminality might develop want to give some reassurance to my right hon friend about the issue of consent which be of course defence if person have allow somebody into their home consent will apply only if it be determined to have be give freely and to have be give on continuous basis of course coercion be the principal test that would be apply in assess that freedom of choice be grateful for that the key bit about cuckooing be that the police have never be able to arrest somebody because they have take over house they have to prove that there be criminal activity inside this new offence will therefore break new ground and protect people there be an important point about coercion will the minister guarantee that in the guidance note attach to the bill it will be clear to the police that they should be check that victim be not be coerce into say that they have give their consent it be important for the police to know that that be an excellent suggestion confirm that and thank my right hon friend once again before conclude would like to address number of other matter that have be raise by hon member and table as amendment start with the new clause table by my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch before the minister move on apologise if she have address this and miss it could get from she an explanation about government new clause which seek to remove the protection of the human rights act by effectively exclude the defence of lawful or reasonable excuse this be now the fourth piece of legislation that the government have introduce that will remove the protection of the human rights act we understand the reason why they could not proceed with bill of right but surely if they be to remove human right protection that should be do in proper consider manner and not through salami slicing such as this will have to double check that new clause but simply say that with two exception all the convention right be qualified right which can be restrict in reasonable circumstance promise that will check that and come back to the right hon gentleman in wind up the debate if may be in the process of pay tribute to my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford and my right hon friend the member for tunbridge wells greg clark for the outstanding representation that they have give to their constituent who be affect by david fuller act of depravity that be reflect in new clause which the government support on the offence of necrophilia it be perhaps rare thing in that an offence can be identify that parliament have not previously consider but such be the extent of fuller offending that we have have to do so the government be pleased to confirm that the sexual offences act will be amend by the bill to capture the sexual touching of corpse with new maximum sentence of seven year for penetrative offence and five year for non penetrative act thank the minister for her kind comment my right hon friend the member for tunbridge wells greg clark will try to catch the deputy speaker eye later to speak in more detail on this but let take this opportunity to pay tribute to the minister for take lot of time to work through this amendment thoughtfully and correctly to provide great protection and give some comfort to the family of the victim of david fuller that justice have be think about she have listen sensitively and carefully to the comment of our constituent thank my hon friend for her comment they be truly appalling crime and have the constituent of both my hon friend in mind when think about how to develop the law we can not change what happen in the past but hope we can send the clear possible message in future want to come to couple of other matter though will not pre empt what hon member might be incline to say first want to talk about new clause on one punch manslaughter pay special tribute to my hon friend and my friend the member for bishop auckland dehenna davison this be not an ordinary campaign for she but one bear out of the deep tragedy of her childhood know that she will speak to the new clause and will respond in detail but hope she will not mind my saying that think her dad would feel very proud of how she have conduct herself on this issue and would be pleased with the change that we be make come to the amendment table by the hon member for stockton north alex cunningham on prisoner transfer to overseas prison want to set out the government position in general and in particular in relation to the transfer criterion the government agree that not all prisoner will be appropriate for transfer to rent prison overseas indeed the hon member have set out some very sensible principle in his own amendment would like to give he three point of reassurance the proposal for foreign prisoner transfer will extend to approximately prisoner equivalent to just under half of of the entire prison estate can confirm that we will not negotiate prison transfer agreement with woman prison we will conclude deal only with country that can demonstrate that its prison condition and capability meet the applicable human right standard the secretary of state retain responsibility for each prisoner which ensure that any transfer prisoner retain all their right under the european convention on human right irrespective of where they may be transfer however we believe that legislation be the good place for negotiate further term with the appropriate involvement of expert the lord chancellor have already confirm that the use of these power require valid international agreement and any such agreement would be put before parliament as treaty subject to ratification procedure contain in the constitutional reform and governance act be grateful to the minister for those reassurance but some of we have mark misgiving about the whole concept which speak little more of gimmickry than anything likely to ease the real pressure on our prison that say can see that it might be tool in the box could she help on two matter that the law society have raise if the agreement be use what arrangement will ensure that prisoner be able to access legal advice in proper way perhaps in relation to appeal or other proceeding that be essential to ensure fair approach how will they be able to participate remotely if necessary in any ongoing legal proceeding secondly what be to be do about family visit as the minister will know the retention of family tie be particularly important and recognise universally as key factor in rehabilitation and prevent reoffende we would not want to disrupt those opportunity for anyone be transfer thank my hon and learn friend for his sensible intervention which engage two issue article consideration on the right to fair trial and article consideration on the right to respect for private and family life we be keenly aware of those obligation be sorry that can not give more detail on that only the extra reassurance that the lord chancellor have insist that prisoner will retain all their right under the convention these will be principal consideration will ask the lord chancellor to write to my hon and learn friend to flesh out some of those response my hon friend have give wide range opening speech but want to press she on one more issue spike first thank she for recognise the importance of create an offence to cover it we have spate of spike attack in nottingham and the story of the young people affect be chilling seek her reassurance that we will create the most robust possible legislation in this area and that she will look kindly on the amendment table by my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham who have lead fantastic campaign to get spike recognise in law it be so important that we cover all the intention that someone might have when they set about spike someone even if it be that they think it might be bit of fun it be certainly not fun for their victim and it be important that we do not create loophole where offender might be able to wriggle off the hook hope that can provide my hon friend my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford and my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham with some reassurance the offence be draft to cover all possible outcome we look very carefully at the wording want to provide some specific reassurance about attempt which know my hon friend the member for gloucester be concerned about it be in his amendment it be not necessary to put separate offence of attempt to spike in the bill because it be capture as an inchoate offence under section of the criminal attempts act which cover all form of attempt of crime that be on the statute book hope that provide some reassurance thank member on all side of the house for their engagement in the bill their joint commitment to its successful development as legislation that enhance our criminal justice system and that deliver robust protection appropriate penalty and well framework of justice for the public our government amendment achieve that and will respond in due course to member view commend the amendment and new clause to the house call the opposition spokesperson we be finally here week since committee stage be complete the government be run scared not just from we on the opposition benches but from their own member we very much welcome the huge pile of concession make and the clause withdraw give credit to member across the benches for hold the government to account surely the bill must be one of the good example ever of how not to create new legislation with dozen of government amendment in committee and now dozen more on report as well as many new clause from ministers by friday evening there be as many as page of they from the government alone the hon gentleman seem to suggest that ministers should not listen to case make by member on both side of the house it be to the government credit that they have listen to people across the piece however huge number of clause and new idea have be bring forward by the government which be not table in committee or even mention on second reading as my hon friend the member for poplar and limehouse apsana begum say this be not the way to do business let address the many government new clause and amendment and those in my name and that of my partner in crime the hon member for nottingham north alex norris and those in the name of my hon friend the member for birmingham ladywood shabana mahmood and other start with amendment in the name of my hon friend the hon member for nottingham north and government new clause the creation of deepfake pornography be modern phenomenon but one with very traditional intention to cause humiliation distress and public embarrassment and to weaken the victim relationship it be right that as the technology become more sophisticated so do the legal protection on second reading and in committee we welcome the bill provision on intimate photograph or film and voyeurism sexual offending in the online and digital word continue to grow at terrifying pace the rise in deepfake be concern for variety of reason not least for the impact on political debate and the spread of false information have also be horrify by report of the use of deepfake to sexually harass and humiliate individual the exponential rise in the use of explicit deepfake image demand urgent legislative action create an explicit deepfake without someone consent be deeply violate act one that cause victim to feel embarrassed alarmed and unsafe commend my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen for her work on new clause it would create an offence of create or share mislead content such content can reach wide audience in short space of time with question over legitimacy come far too late when the harm have already be do my hon friend recognise the impact that such abuse of technology have on our democracy as we say in committee there be gap we feel that victim ought to have similar or the same protection when imagery be fake as they do when the image be real we be disappoint that the government knock that suggestion back in committee but we welcome the fact that they have now table their own version of an amendment that address the point in government new clause which we will of course support on new clause do the hon gentleman share the concern of many woman outside this place about the almost backward step the government have take by not focus on base offence relate to people give consent to their image be use think we have win that argument but that seem to have evaporate that be central to the online safety act why be he not press for that change as other be outside this place the right hon member make strong point and it be up to the government to respond to it we believe that we should extend all protection to woman in all circumstance we welcome amendment in the name of the chair of the women and equalities committee the right hon member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes the online safety act make significant progress on intimate image abuse or revenge porn which be an abhorrent crime and it be right that through this bill we continue the good work do through that act we therefore support amendment which would make offence relate to non consensual intimate photograph or film priority offence under the online safety act that will ensure that this heinous practice be treat seriously and deal with proactively so that the harm it cause be reduce new clause make it an aggravate factor if an offence of manslaughter involve sexual conduct and do the same for the correspond service offence the government have support from across the house when they restate in statute in the domestic abuse act that person be unable to consent to the infliction of harm that result in actual bodily harm or their own death for the purpose of obtain sexual gratification it will therefore not surprise the government to hear that the new clause have the support of labour members we be all aware of the high profile case in which woman have be kill as result of allegedly consensual sado masochistic act of violence during sex we share the government ambition to do more on the issue in recognition of the serious public concern about these horrific case amendment in my name would ensure that when court order defendant to attend sentencing they first satisfy themselves that that would not put their staff at risk government amendment and low the threshold for the availability of the new power to order an offender to attend sentencing hearing so that it apply where an offence be punishable with imprisonment for year or more clause come in the wake of dismaying trend of high profile criminal opt not to attend their sentencing hearing former neonatal nurse lucy letby do that in august last year she refuse to attend her sentencing hearing for the murder of seven baby and the attempt murder of another six entrust to her care have also refuse to attend via video link she remain in the cell below manchester crown court as bereaved family member deliver victim personal statement and the judge pass whole life order in her absence in april last year thomas cashman exploit the same procedural rule by refuse to attend his sentencing hearing he travel to manchester crown court but decline to leave his cell claim that he have be provoke by court official he receive sentence of life imprisonment with minimum term of year for the fatal shooting of nine year old olivia pratt korbel in her home we share the view that wherever possible defendant ought to hear the victim impact statement set out how victim and family have be affect by the crime in committee the under secretary of state for the home department the hon member for newbury laura farris accept that the judge now have discretion to make such an order but we have find that it be not evenly or always report criminal justice public bill committee january as in the case of lucy letby where the judge do not compel her attendance the minister say that put the measure in the bill would ensure power in statute for judge to compel person to attend their sentencing for any serious offence for which the maximum sentence be life sentence the government page of amendment include those to clause and we be supportive of all effort to improve the bill workability say in committee that there be nothing in the government explanatory note about the resource need to deliver the policy likewise there be little if anything about how the staff who would be at the sharp end of deliver defendant to court will be protect the charity justice raise the concern with that the policy put staff at risk it be questionable whether the discretion to use force in propose new section of the sentencing code be real or merely apparent in view of propose new section have lot of sympathy with the point the shadow minister be make it be right that there should be power think we all agree to prevent vile offender from show the cowardly behaviour of not face the relative and hear their sentence in person however the professional trades union for prison correctional and secure psychiatric workers have concern which he rightly raise prison officer already put their life on the line every day they can be subject to violence when go about their work in prison but there be particular concern we be extend the measure to wide range of offence and very often those involve in bring people to court be contractor from say serco who may not have the experience or training to deal with these rather difficult situation it be perhaps therefore all the more important that there be proper consultation with the workforce who will be at the sharp end as he say indeed that be very much the case few paragraph far on in my speech will address that point specifically as do in committee propose new section state person be to be treat as have comply with an order under subsection if they have do all that they reasonably can to secure that the offender be produce before the court for the sentencing hearing give that subsection provide the authority to use reasonable force those responsible for produce the offender who fail to use such force be arguably at risk of be hold in contempt for fail to comply with court order prison governor and custody officer be accordingly place in an invidious position in her letter to date march the minister say prison officer and prison escort and custody service staff be train in control and restraint technique and we would expect they to use these skill to enforce lawfully give order that an offender should attend court further guidance training and if require personal protective equipment will be provide to ensure that prison and escort staff be fully support to affect such court order the security and safety of prisoner and well being of prison officer will remain priority when first consider clause make enquiry about how reasonable force be currently use by prison officer to deliver defendant to court it come as surprise to to learn that it involve three prison officer in full riot gear include overall glove steel toed boot helmet and shield approach the prisoner secure they and get they into the transport vehicle their job be then complete and responsibility pass to the private security firm staff to deliver the defendant to the court unlike the prison officer neither private security staff nor receive court staff be equip with the personal protective equipment or the training to transfer the defendant first into the court cell and then to the dock that be exactly the point raise by the chair of the justice committee the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill want to raise again with the minister the question of whether the clause will ensure that all staff involve in produce prisoner at their sentencing hearing be protect all the way from the cell to the dock and probably while the prisoner be in the dock as well have bring back amendment in the absence of clarity from the minister about how that would work in practice would welcome her further comment amendment would exclude some type of prisoner from be issue with warrant to serve sentence in foreign country it would exclude people with less than six month to serve those serve indeterminate sentence for public protection and those who need to be detain in the uk for education or training purpose or for legal proceeding such as parole accept what the minister say about that in her speech in committee raise the subject of the failure of the bill and the accompany note to provide detail on exactly how the scheme to transfer prisoner abroad would work who the partner country would be and where their responsibility would lie the minister say that the amendment that have table make sensible point but that the government believe that they be well address through policy base on expertise from within the prison system not set out in primary legislation she also tell that it be her understanding that no prisoner would be move to country not cover by the european convention on human right and welcome what she have say about that today again refer to the minister say he ask about the availability of legal advice first of all the whole landscape of court procedure have change in the last few year receive legal advice can be do remotely and court proceeding often take place remotely via live link official report criminal justice public bill committee january that be suppose to mitigate the fact that someone be in cell abroad the minister be also at pain to point out that of prisoner be foreign national so family and primary care consideration be already rather report criminal justice public bill committee january perhaps there be clue there suggest that it be foreign offender and not british national whom the government really want to send overseas the minister have talk of only prisoner be affect by this policy and welcome her assurance that no woman will be affect know that the government be negotiate with some country about where the prisoner will go but we do not have the fine detail that we need in order to understand whether the policy will be effective the minister herself acknowledge that there be not much detail in the bill but say that the government be develop primary legislation to create the framework for the agreement official report criminal justice public bill committee january she be refer of course to agreement that have not yet be make however policy change all the time so we need to nail down the provision in the bill and who will be include and exclude amendment to amend clause which relate to transfer prisoner to foreign prison amendment would require the controller to make report to the secretary of state on any breach of the arrangement between the foreign country and the uk clause of the original bill provide for the secretary of state to appoint controller to keep under review and report on the running of any rent prison space abroad it also extend the power of his majesty chief inspector of prison to inspect and report on the condition in such place the bill however place great deal of unaccountable authority in the hand of the executive who can make provision for any arrangement by mean of secondary legislation it be silent on how those subject to this arrangement will be treat similarly it provide no guarantee that the prison rule in secondary legislation which govern crucial issue include segregation complaint and the use of force would apply hope the government share my view that any agreement make between the uk and foreign state should be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny and oversight amendment would help to enable that to happen by require the controller to report any breach of the arrangement to the secretary of state amendment would ensure that the prison inspectorate must conduct the duty specify in propose new subsection in section of the prisons act and would ensure its consistency with the legislative basis for its role in england and wales we fear that the oversight of both the controller and his majesty inspectorate of prison will ultimately be subject to negotiation with relevant partner country the wording in the bill relate to the power of the inspectorate differ from the wording in the prisons act in that it state that the chief inspector may rather than shall inspect the implication be that inspection could take place only by invitation of the foreign state rather than as statutory requirement that leave open to future negotiation crucial aspect of hmip role and methodology such as its ability to conduct unannounced inspection to speak to prisoner in private and to access record such as those relate to the use of force which would mean that low standard of independent scrutiny would be apply to the treatment and condition of uk prisoner hold under such arrangement amend the bill to ensure that hmip can perform its duty under the optional protocol to the convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment be an important safeguard to ensure rigorous independent scrutiny amendment would ensure that hmip could inspect escort arrangement under which prisoner be transfer to foreign prison clause of the original bill specifie that the chief inspector may inspect or arrange for the inspection of any prison where prisoner be detain under an arrangement between the uk and foreign state the inspectorate power to inspect escort arrangement be make by amendment to the prisons act in section of the immigration asylum and nationality act it be particularly important that the inspectorate should also be able to inspect the escort arrangement for the transfer of uk prisoner to foreign prison our amendment would bring the legislation into line with the inspectorate power in relation to prison in england and wales by also enable it to inspect or arrange for the inspection of escort arrangement foreign state with which the uk make an agreement could potentially be many thousand of mile from the uk the transfer of prisoner could involve lengthy journey include variety of mode of transport such as potentially prison van plane train and ferry the potential for trouble appear limitless amendment be probe amendment that seek to clarify how the government intend to apply their obligation under article of the european convention on human right on the right to life under the human rights act by ensure that the duty of the coroner also apply to any death involve prisoner subject to transfer agreement with foreign country it be our view that the nature of the arrangement to send individual to overseas prison will establish the uk jurisdiction over any death that occur give the unprecedented nature of these arrangement it be crucial for the responsibility of coroner to investigate overseas death to be establish clearly in advance to do otherwise would invite significant uncertainty and likely legal challenge if any individual be to die while imprison overseas new clause stand in the name of my right hon and learn friend the member for camberwell and peckham ms harman she can not be with we today after fall and be sure that everyone here will want to send she their good wish for speedy recovery her new clause address the parental responsibility of man convict of sexual offence against child government new clause fall short of that in that the offender capture by the clause will be restrict to those sentence for the rape of child however the new clause address the same key issue how can an individual be consider too dangerous to work with or be around other people child yet be allow to have responsibility for child life so long as that child be their own be glad to note that the minister have take away some of the concern raise in committee and that the government have respond with new clause which go some way in the right direction on the issue raise by my right hon and learn friend however be not sure that the minister have entirely accept the explanation offer to she in this regard as have say my right hon and learn friend can not be here today but pay tribute on her behalf not just to the ministers and the bbc sanchia berg but to the bravery and persistence of bethan family who have fight to protect not only their own child but everyone else should be interested to hear the minister explanation for the restriction of the provision to those who have be convict of the rape of child only there be discussion in committee about the breadth of the scope when the proposal be to include all sex offence in such provision but it seem to that the government have go too far in the other direction albeit while make concession only include those convict of the rape of child constitute narrow scope and as such will leave scope for man who have be convict of other serious sex offence against child to be in control of important aspect of their child life it prompt the question why should any child be subject to any form of control by convict child sex offender who be unlikely to be part of that child life for year ahead and possibly forever new clause which be table by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith and government new clause and and new schedule would make it an offence to exercise control over another person residence for the purpose of criminal activity by mean of coercion threat or abuse of position of vulnerability in committee propose new clause that would make cuckoo specific offence be pleased not only that the new clause have since be table by the right hon member chingford and woodford green but that the government have subsequently see sense and follow suit as be make clear in committee substantial harm be cause by cuckooing so be keen to hear the minister thought on the issue do however remain supportive of new clause and and new schedule which together create the offence of exercise control over another person dwelling for the purpose of enable it to be use in connection with the commission of certain offence when speak to the new clause in committee receive support from the police superintendents association which say there be clear need for legislation of this kind with evidence show that cuckooing be widely use tactic in many serious offence include those link to serious and organised crime such as county line drug supply and human trafficking cuckooing be terrifying experience for the vulnerable adult who be target by these criminal and do not think that any of we can comprehend what it would mean to have our home take over in such way suspect that there be not member here who do not know vulnerable adult in their constituency or someone who live alone who could be target by such unscrupulous criminal the police work with local authority to deliver safeguarding response for victim of cuckooing for example the metropolitan police service have dedicate cuckooing officer who work with partner to safeguard victim and divert they from the criminal justice system however cuckooing be not define in legislation and be not specific offence so today government amendment be very welcome my hon friend the member for swansea east carolyn harris raise the issue of profiteer from prostitution in new clause as she do in committee she have explain that it would enact the recommendation of the cross party home affairs committee to make it criminal offence to facilitate or profit from the prostitution of another person online or offline there be clearly gap in provision if our law mean it be illegal to pimp offline but not online note that in the minister response to the committee she suggest that the new clause as draft would also prevent individual who lawfully sell sex from do so online where they feel safe and as result these individual could be force into additional danger by have to advertise on the street or underground in some way certainly recognise the minister concern any provision must ensure that those whom it be intend to protect do not inadvertently come to additional harm be however sceptical that the measure in the online safety act whereby online platform for individual advertising be responsible and accountable for the content on their site will do as much as she claim to address these issue new clause which stand in the name of the hon member for bishop auckland dehenna davison be intend to create specific offence of one punch manslaughter with minimum sentence of seven year my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips move the same new clause in committee but it be not push to vote we commend the hon member for bishop auckland for her effort on this issue and we understand that she be continue her discussion with ministers we hope that progress be be make behind the scene new clause which deal with control or coercive behaviour by person provide psychotherapy or counselling service be an interesting clause in its own right and there be good discussion on its content in the other place when the provision be table as an amendment to what be now the domestic abuse act the new clause aim to address the controlling and coercive behaviour effect by charlatan therapist that can have ruinous consequence for the life of their client clearly any instance of such manipulation and abuse be deeply concern especially give the trust role that psychotherapist and counsellor be put in by their client who often engage their service when they be in particularly vulnerable place will be interested to hear the government thought on the scale of the issue and on what other measure could be implement to address this problem there be suggestion in the debate on the domestic abuse act that regulation and accreditation would be the appropriate response although several member point out that charlatan do not tend to go through the effort of accreditation none the less be concern by the report of individual often young woman be harm by such practice and be keen to hear from the government how this could be address new clause be table by my hon friend the member for merthyr tydfil and rhymney gerald jones who be in his place today and can speak to the tragic case in his constituency that it seek to address want to reiterate what we say in committee the road traffic act provide vital protection to all of we it bar certain behaviour that we know be dangerous but there be loophole whereby those sort of behaviour can be exhibit on private property without sanction it be reasonable to bring the law on private property into alignment with the rta in the interest of public safety in committee the government seem to be of similar mind however this be one of the few area where they have not propose their own version today we hope that the minister will signal their intent to do so at later stage or if not that they will accept my hon friend version which we support in addition my hon friend the member for bootle peter dowd have table new clause and for which he make strong case in committee hope the government have have the chance to reflect on his proposal and will respond to they positively new clause and which stand in the name of my hon friend the member for nottingham north would update section of the computer misuse act which prohibit unauthorised access to computer simply put the current legislation inadvertently criminalise large proportion of legitimate vulnerability security and threat intelligence research by uk cyber security professional who be commit crime if they use legitimate technique to check for vulnerability to carry out research or to build defence we be ask they to put themselves at risk in order to do something that be clearly social good so the new clause seek to update the act in the uk alone there be increase in cyber threat last year we know that their impact on individual life can be hugely consequential but the legislation that provide the foundation to take on that sort of cyber threat be more than year old legislation have not keep pace with modern cyber security defence technique so it be vital that we take the opportunity to act now and update the law accordingly new clause and would do that in similar vein new clause seek to update the statute book to ensure that the law keep pace with change this time in relation to liability for corporate offence the new clause also stand in the name of my hon friend the member for nottingham north and he pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge for she continue campaign on this matter it would introduce individual liability so that senior executive can be hold liable for criminal activity commit by company or partnership on the basis of negligence the offence would apply both to crime commit by the company or partnership and to failure to prevent those crime from happen the uk have serious accountability gap when it come to senior executive despite number of corporate scandal and failure such as the miscarriage of justice at the post office and water company illegally discharge sewage into our river those at the helm of large company that engage in such wrongdoing rarely face any consequence that lead to poor corporate governance standard and to great risk that the huge cost of corporate failure and misconduct will be bear by ordinary people it be also unfair that director in the small business sector face the vast brunt of prosecutorial and regulatory action regulatory fine alone be not sufficient to drive behavioural change if the senior executive at these company be not hold criminally liable fine become cost of do business rather than deterrent to bad behaviour we need to reform the law so that we can hold senior executive criminally liable for deliberately turn blind eye or create culture of misconduct that would lower the risk of further corporate failure new clause would make that change new clause on the offence of possession of guidance on create child sexual abuse content and new clause on the offence of simulate sexual communication with child be table by the right hon member for chelmsford vicky ford new clause would expand the exist offence of possess guide about abuse child sexually to include guide on create child sexual abuse content include through the use of artificial intelligence or machine learning new clause would create an offence of use create or share online or digital tool that simulate sexual communication with child we know that the increase online presence of child and the late technological development create new opportunity for abuse ofcom agree that the sexual exploitation and abuse of child online be persistent and grow threat with devastating consequence for those affect new risk be emerge as the way we interact online continue to evolve include through extended reality end to end encryption and generative ai in bbc report maker of child sexual abuse image be find to be use ai software call stable diffusion this software be intend to generate image for use in art or graphic design but the bbc have find that it be be use to create lifelike image of child sexual abuse include the rape of baby and toddler under article of the united nations convention on the right of the child state party have an obligation to protect the child from all form of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse the criminalisation of online sexual exploitation and abuse form part of states party obligation to protect child under article of the crc the un committee on the right of the child affirm this in general comment no by call on state party to put appropriate legislation in place to protect child from the crime that occur in the digital environment and to allocate sufficient resource to ensure that crime in the digital environment be investigate and prosecute that include online child sexual exploitation and abuse offence under international standard legislation concern child sexual abuse material should be introduce or amend to incorporate technology specific terminology and to specifically capture child sexual abuse material available online this child sexual abuse material include live performance and arguably computer generate image that have be create with the purpose of convey the impression that they depict child in its recent report how ai be be abuse to create child sexual abuse imagery the internet watch foundation recommend the ministry of justice to commission review of the law that apply to the removal of this content online to ensure they be fit for purpose to tackle the threat of ai csam this include ensure the exchange of hint and tip and paedophile manual on how to generate this content be make illegal in oral evidence to the house of lords communications and digital committee ian hogarth chair of the uk ai foundation model taskforce speak of how some of the open source image generation model have now be fine tune by malicious actor to generate child sexual abuse material these system be be use for really some of the most heinous thing out there criminal be find new way to harm child as technology move forward it be right that the legislation aim at protect child from online harm must move with it new clause would clarify the definition of joint enterprise or secondary liability so that an individual must make significant contribution to an offence commit by another to be criminally liable there have be considerable discussion in the house recently on reform joint enterprise include as result of the tireless campaigning of my hon friend the member for liverpool riverside kim johnson who have be advance private member bill on this issue it seem that the consensus from the house many discussion be that reform be clearly need there be no doubt of the injustice that have arise from the application of joint enterprise law as my hon friend the member for lewisham east janet daby say in her speech on the joint enterprise significant contribution bill which have just mention joint enterprise be an important tool in our criminal justice system that have help to secure conviction that otherwise would not have be successful include of some of the man who kill stephen lawrence it have also be successfully use to prosecute paedophile ring and those who commit economic crime but the doctrine be certainly in need of reform labour have previously state that it would look to reform joint enterprise and that remain our ambition however the crown prosecution service have ongoing work to collect datum on joint enterprise prosecution the initial tranche of datum reveal matter of huge concern black people make up only of the uk population but accord to the cps black defendant make up of the joint enterprise case load it be also reveal that joint enterprise prosecution disproportionately affect young people and child the data collection have now be expand into all cps area and to ensure that any reform have the good chance of address the ongoing issue with the application of the doctrine it be essential that it be base on strong evidence base once strong evidence base have be build up through the cps data collection we will be well place to know how to reform the law to tackle the issue about which there be such serious cross party concern this amendment be reasonable and commendable but when we take action to reform it be important that we do it right first time only full picture provide by robust evidence can ensure we do that new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for swansea east seek to align the definition of human trafficking in uk law with the un definition my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley make the case well for this new clause in committee where she highlight the lack of conviction under the current framework hope the minister can set out what the government intend to do to rectify this new clause in the name of the hon member for carshalton and wallington elliot colburn would include offence motivate by hostility towards an individual disability status sexual orientation or transgender identity or perception thereof in the aggravate offence under the crime and disorder act we support the amendment all the more because it be identical to the new clause that table in committee and it be labour party policy the amendment would address the disparity between exist characteristic and current hate crime legislation it would create parity of maximum possible penalty for all five characteristic define under the sentencing code under current hate crime legislation hate crime base on race religion can have high maximum penalty than their base equivalent whereas hate crime base on sexual orientation transgender identity disability can not this create two tier system of justice the law commission recommendation that offence motivate by hostility towards an individual disability status sexual orientation or transgender identity should be encompass within the aggravate offence under the crime and disorder act new clause come in the context of soar level of hate crime reporting over case be report in across all monitor strand of hate crime the number of offence have soar since racially motivated hate crime rise by over in the period top instance for the first time in meanwhile hate crime motivate by religion increase by massive hate crime motivate by sexual orientation have increase by and hate crime motivate by transgender identity have increase by violent crime or crime against the person rise as proportion of hate crime offence from in to in the number of violent hate crime have rise sixfold from to in people and people with disability should be able to live their life free from fear abuse or violence labour have commit to take back our street and to be tough on hate crime we will do so by strengthen and equalise the law so that every category of hate crime be treat as an aggravated offence to ensure that everyone who fall victim to hate crime be treat equally under the law hope that the government will support new clause the minister say in committee that later this year the government intend to publish full response that will address each recommendation of the law commission report and that it would be premature to make decision before the formal government response be publish however urge the hon member for carshalton and wallington to stick with his new clause and to press it to vote if it be not accept by the government it be always pleasure to speak to the amendment of my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley her tireless mission to stand up for victim in all form be respect across this house and think she be still due huge number of answer from the minister relate to her amendment which have be retable new clause would amend section and of the sexual offences act to replace prostitution with sexual exploitation the reason for do so ultimately lie with shift perception adult sexual exploitation be form of sexual abuse that be poorly understand and rarely recognise across many sector victim of adult sexual exploitation be falsely identify as consensually engage in sex work and the labelling of that abuse as prostitution in law serve only to perpetuate it this mislabelling have lead to countless people across the uk fall through the gap and not receive necessary support as their experience be not recognise new clause and would address the gap in law that can lead to the unjust stigmatisation and criminalisation of victim of sexual exploitation they would do so by decriminalise conduct fall within section of the street offences act street prostitution offence and by establish mechanism to expunge criminal record for street prostitution offence look forward to the minister response new clause would make an aggravating factor of groom in certain adult case include around domestic and sexual abuse my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley move her new clause in committee and speak of how little understand the grooming of adult be despite there be considerable overlap of perpetrator and of perpetrator behaviour and tactic with those see in case of child sexual grooming grooming be deliberate process of limit the freedom of person by gain control over they and create dependency it be widespread and prevalent in every part of the uk but it be under represent in uk legislation it seem sensible to seek to put adult grooming victim on the same footing as child do not feel that the under secretary of state for the home department the hon member for newbury address this point adequately in committee which be why it be important to invite further comment today new clause would classify strangulation as an aggravating factor in sentencing murder it follow new law on non fatal strangulation that be introduce under the domestic abuse act in committee my hon friend highlight that the common understanding of the role of strangulation in domestic abuse be change it be now understand as form of coercive control and an accurate red flag predicter of homicide it be clear that there be need for review in this area and for we to look holistically at sentencing rather than attempt to amend the criminal justice system base on piecemeal change on new clause and the charity centre for women justice say that the bill do not address the gap in law and practice that can lead to the unjust criminalisation of victim of domestic abuse and other form of violence against woman and girl and exploitation new clause would amend the law on self defence and be model on the provision for householder in section of the criminal justice and immigration act it would allow survivor act in self defence against their abuser the same protection as householder defend themselves against an intruder in other word this be the self defence proposal new clause and schedule would introduce statutory defence for survivor model on section of the modem slavery act it would give survivor of domestic abuse similar protection to that give to victim of trafficking who be compel to offend this be under the section proposal research by cwj and other have make it clear that law reform be need to address the difficulty face by victim of domestic abuse in establish reasonableness and proportionality when accuse of use force in these circumstance again would welcome the minister comment on my hon friend proposal which seek to improve the law for victim new clause deal with the offence of child criminal exploitation there have be numerous call to do more legislatively to address that include by create statutory definition over the course of this parliament recall my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion speak powerfully on these issue in the committee on the bill that become the police crime sentencing and courts act opposition members have be pursue the issue again through the victims and prisoners bill clearly reform be need to tackle the appalling scale of child criminal exploitation research carry out by the children commissioner find that child who be at high risk of gang exploitation have not be identify by service and consequently be miss out on vital support to keep they safe the research find an even high number of child who be experience broad risk factor link to exploitation with one in teenager fall through the gap in education and social care thousand of child be be criminally exploit and that demand more of response from the government well reason amendment have be make to number of government bills in recent year as have just outline as new clause which stand in the name of the hon member for mole valley sir paul beresford demonstrate they be come from across the house so what will it take for the government to engage constructively with member who be deeply concerned about this issue and the danger face our young constituent the government should engage more constructively new clause be an interesting provision give the increase in bike and cycling in general we recognise the need for some change in this area of law that say we be keen to understand exactly how the provision in the new clause would work the impact they would have and the number of potential case likely to be create we be not sure that the new clause be fit for purpose so we will also be interested to hear from the minister however we be satisfied that this be an area in which we would wish to legislate after the general election if we be successful come to the serious issue raise in new clause by my hon friend the member for nottingham north alex norris in relation to knife crime which destroy life devastate family and create fear and trauma in community many of we will have constituent who have be deeply impact by knife crime sadly the situation be get bad not well the late statistic show knife crime up again in the past year it be now high than it be in the opposition have always be clear that we will work with the government on this matter so that we can take dangerous weapon off the street and save life in that spirit my hon friend table his new clause propose ban on ninja sword many will be shock that such weapon be not ban already in the wrong hand they can cause significant harm and they should be take off the street without delay new clause would introduce such ban of course there be wide point about the ease with which such weapon be buy and sell mostly online and then end up in the hand of young people new clause and amendment also stand in my hon friend name seek to address that point the prevalence of ban weapon find on online marketplace be shocking and must be tackle yet there seem to be no accountability we need tough criminal sanction on the senior tech executive who allow such knife sale on their online marketplace new clause would introduce such sanction more widely we need complete end to end review of online knife sale from the point of purchase through to delivery particularly to strengthen id check and check conduct by royal mail and border force on uk bind parcel unfortunately we be see too many gap and loophole in effort to tackle knife crime we need to identify and deal with they before they be exploit far amendment will place duty on the secretary of state to conduct such review and begin that process take together new clause and and amendment form part of labour plan to tackle the scourge of knife crime on the street as have say the opposition will work with the government on the issue young life depend on it hope we can make progress on this soon new clause and in the name of the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron create an offence of fail to meet pollution performance commitment level for water quality and address individual senior manager responsibility speak of that early it be labour policy to bring forward legislation to strengthen the law in this area we would put the water company under special measure strengthen regulation so that lawbreake water boss face criminal charge and give the regulator new power to block the payment of bonus until water boss have clean up their filth we would also end self monitoring force all company to monitor every single water outlet so that company can no long cover up illegal sewage dumping and introduce severe and automatic fine which no water boss can ignore for illegal sewage discharge we feel that these new clause be too narrow but we will legislate in government in conclusion wish to pose few question to the minister what impact will the provision in the bill have on the criminal justice system and in particular our crisis hit prison service as say at the outset many of the government own new clause and amendment do not arrive until few day before today report stage what impact assessment have be carry out and when can we expect to see it may remind the government that we be still wait on the economic impact assessment for the police crime sentencing and courts act which receive royal assent two year ago finally let again address the prison crisis some of the propose sentence in the bill be number in month how do that sit with the government position on the presumption against short sentence and their current policy of give host of prisoner up to day off their sentence so they can make way for new one clearly ministers have balance act to perform but despite the merit of some of the clause in the bill they be create more problem without solution far down the system however we look forward to the bill progressing and to day two of our proceeding assume of course that that will actually come before the general election rise before we proceed would like to make couple of observation these be very serious and sensitive issue that deserve and be clearly go to get proper debate in his closing remark the hon member for stockton north alex cunningham indicate that there be two day for this debate early an hon member intervene on the minister to raise subject that she have not comment upon there be good reason for that it be list not on the order paper for today but on the order paper for the second day ask hon member to make quite sure that when they be discuss these issue they be discuss those list on the order paper for today in the understanding that there will be second day there be hon member wish to speak may have miss one so there may be more at the moment we have plenty of time but may gently urge conciseness rather than self indulgence that relate particularly to intervention which should be intervention and not speech call the chair of the women and equalities committee rise to speak to amendment table in my name and support by member of the women and equalities committee and other colleague across the house will endeavour to be as brief as can and reassure everybody that the amendment be on the order paper for today thank my hon friend the minister for her comment on deepfake there have be problem someone like taylor swift can get deepfake make use their image take down very quickly but for ordinary woman or indeed man from across the uk who be not famous and do not have platform it be very difficult to get deepfake imagery remove welcome the step the government be take on that thank the shadow minister the hon member for stockton north alex cunningham for his comment about the amendment be not aware that the opposition be plan to support it so thank he for that urge my hon friend the minister to pay close attention to what and other member of my select committee will say about the amendment recognise that the amendment come at the eleventh hour on report for which apologise to my hon friend the reason for that be specifically because of the evidence the committee hear last week both in private and in public from victim of revenge porn welcome the change that have be bring in under the online safety act to support victim of non consensual intimate image abuse however from the evidence we hear it be clear that the legislation in its current form do not go far enough it do not give ofcom the tooth it need to effectively tackle the fast spread uncontrollable virus that be non consensual intimate image abuse it do not force platform to remove harmful content in its entirety or require internet service provider to block access to it in short it do not make the content itself illegal the sharing of it be illegal but even if there be criminal conviction the content itself be not regard as illegal content last week the women and equalities committee hear from number of survivor of non consensual intimate image abuse in share their experience with we they have speak of the catastrophic damage the abuse have have on their life confidence and relationship they tell we of their fear of apply for job meet new people or dare to have any social medium presence at all with all their case there be common theme even though they have secure conviction against their perpetrator their non consensual content continue to circulate on the internet despite relentless work by organisation such as the revenge porn helpline to report the content and get it take down there be no legal obligation for platform to remove it thank my right hon friend the chair of the select committee for make an excellent point which support the point make early if the bill have consent base creation offence in it that would outlaw the image that the people she be talk about find so difficult to get off the internet surely the bill provide the opportunity to introduce consent base creation offence rather than the current proposal that potentially provide lot of loophole particularly to online app to use intention to try to evade the long arm of the law my right hon friend point be exactly right that the issue be consent in my view when image be non consensual they should be regard in the same way as if the individual have be digitally rap there be also many thousand of case where conviction have not be achieve or even seek where the victim just want the content take down or block they too be be deny that peace of mind due to gap in the current legislative framework the amendment call for non consensual intimate photograph or film to be add to the list of priority offence in the online safety act thus make it priority illegal content the amendment would ensure that non consensual content regardless of whether or not conviction have be achieve would be by its non consensual intimate nature illegal it would place duty on platform to remove it and require internet service provider to block access to non compliant site and platform include those host outside the uk that be precisely the way in which child sexual abuse material be handle child can not provide consent and the adult in these image have not provide their consent for they to be take share or both so why should the content be treat so differently indeed when the hon member for east renfrewshire kirsten oswald put it to my hon friend the minister during her recent appearance before my committee that adult content should be handle in the same way as child sexual abuse material via registry to identify classify and therefore allow for the removal of non consensual intimate image the minister say it would be very good idea in order to do that we need to make the content illegal it be important to note that intimate imagery do not just refer to photo and video that be sexually explicit indeed as we hear from david wright chief executive of south west grid for learning which run the revenge porn helpline within certain country and culture be photograph with an arm around somebody or be film without hijab can have catastrophic implication for woman that be why it be so important that any legislative change use the term intimate not sexual when refer to non consensual content last week we hear evidence from georgia harrison who famously be the victim of revenge porn perpetrate by she then partner stephen bear who later receive criminal conviction for his action and be send to prison georgia make the point repeatedly that what happen be like house fire because when the image go up they spread very quickly the solution be to get they take down as quickly as possible so that they would not proliferate the committee describe it as be like virus that spread out of control the issue be not just about georgia harrison or famous woman who have platform they can use to ensure their voice be hear we also hear from an anonymous victim of operation makedom in that case the perpetrator have many thousand of victim he receive year prison sentence but that young woman be too afraid to have any sort of social medium presence because she be terrified that her image will be see and put through reverse image search so she will be identify as victim thousand and thousand of the operation makedom image still proliferate online and nothing can be do about that because the content itself be not illegal it remain online and accessible for people in the uk despite that year prison sentence that can not be right we will be let down the victim of that abuse and all other case of non consensual intimate image abuse if we fail to act my final point to the minister be that we also hear about the criminal injuries compensation authority and the fact that intimate image abuse be not on its list as violent crime when someone apply to the authority expect or hop for some small nugget of compensation message in effect that they be victim they can put the blame and shame to one side and they have be victim of criminal act that be not even there for they have no doubt that be because the list of violent criminal offence be dream up many moon ago and intimate image abuse simply have not be add to it it should be add to the list as say early for woman or indeed man who have have their intimate image put online circulate freely and proliferate all over the place that be like digital rape it be rape that continue day after day to be brutally honest with no end in sight those be the reason why my committee have table this amendment and why we urge member to support it and give it serious consideration hope that my hon friend the minister will be able to make some comment from the dispatch box that might indicate how the moj can incorporate such provision into exist law if the message come back to be that the content be already illegal must say that it be not we must find well way of get it down from online platform call the liberal democrat spokesman it be pleasure to serve under your guidance this afternoon mr deputy speaker also will seek to be brief and will principally speak to the two amendment in my name let first say that fully support new clause endorse by the right hon member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes likewise pay tribute to the hon member for bishop auckland dehenna davison and support her new clause on one punch manslaughter again stick with those on the conservative benches support amendment to from the hon member for gloucester richard graham cover the issue of spiking which be an incredibly serious offence there be many on the opposition benches to whom could also refer but will not do so because of time support new clause in the name of the hon member for bootle peter dowd which cover the offence of fail to stop at traffic accident and seek to close loophole to ensure that justice be do let now focus on new clause and in my name new clause create the criminal offence of fail to meet pollution performance commitment and new clause would make senior manager criminally liable for such an offence if there be any doubt at all that these new clause be need they should have be dispel by quick look at the news early today we have reveal this be discover by some of we only yesterday that early this year million litre of raw sewage be dump into england large and most popular lake windermere at the heart of my constituency and our community in westmoreland this incident happen for hour united utilities do not alert the environment agency for hour the outrageous scale of this incident bring into question the extent to which the current framework be adequate this be personal issue to we this be lake at the centre of the lake district hospitality and tourism economy which bring in million visitor every year the big number of visitor to any part of the united kingdom outside london we be proud of that it be an industry that employ people worth billion to the local economy and contribute hugely to the national economy the fact that this be permit at the heart of the jewel in the crown of our tourism economy in this country be an utter outrage the ecological side of it be even more utterly utterly appalling the revelation of the past day or so have prove that the regulatory framework be utterly and totally broken so the call for these new clause for and the creation of criminal liability in this case be absolutely justify the offence that have just speak about be the tip of the iceberg shall talk principally about my own water company in the north west of england united utilities that company spill sewage time for almost hour there be two site on the river kent at kendal one spill sewage on occasion and the other on occasion the river eea at cark on the cartmel peninsula near grange over sands see the most egregious example in the whole of the north west of england sewage be spill time for hour last year the river eden at kirkby stephen see spill for hour at beautiful coniston water which have just celebrate be give bathing water status at four site only the other day pay tribute to local councillor suzanne pender and the local parish council for achieve that really important classification there be sewage spill in on day across all the water company in england there be separate spill in that be increase on the water company and indeed ministers themselves say that that be because it rain more last year not more it do these spill be unjustifiable we be leave in situation where only of england river be at an ecologically good standard of all of the river in england not one fat zero per cent be of good chemical standard my new clause which create criminal offence be necessary because the regulatory framework be fail regulator have repeatedly let the water company off the hook and the datum that they have to work on be incomplete minister will say and rightly that until relatively recently there be not lot of datum available and that monitoring do not happen but who do the monitoring the water company do the monitoring they mark their own homework the environment agency which be underfunde and the victim of many cut over many year by this government be oblige to come out and inspect at spill site only if the water company invite it to do so how ridiculous and how weak be that ofwat attempt to tackle egregious act by the water company be inadequate they be too little and too late for instance ofwat have drag its foot to get around to merely consult on plan to ban bonus perhaps sometime next year with only the outside possibility that this could come into force process that river action an excellent campaign organisation rightly describe as far too slow again ofwat have take until now to consider fine of up to of water company turnover for the bad form of poor customer service why so long why only now the office for environmental protection find that the government be set to miss their target to improve the state of england river lake and coastal area by significant margin in the liberal democrat policy paper be you drink what we be drink we propose new regulator with new power to issue fine to top executive and to initiate proceeding give that we be where we be simply ask the house to consider new clause and as crucial way of be able to tackle the most egregious act of sewage dumping in our lake river and coastal waterway for those of we in and around the english lake district this matter be personal it be offensive to we we consider ourselves if it be not too grand to say this as custodian of england lake district we be protect the area not for we but for the whole country the world the generation who come after we and the people who will make use of lake windemere and the ecology that it support at the heart of the stunning beauty of the lake district which be after all world heritage site we be determined to tackle this problem pay tribute to all of those who campaign on this issue include matt staniek and all those involve in the save windermere campaign and other who be determined to make difference citizen science project go on in the rivers kent and eden be equally important they be more low key but be absolutely vital to try to get to the heart of the problem however all the datum in the world will not solve this problem if we do not have the law to prevent what be happen and to hold people to account the regulatory framework have fail windermere the lake district westmorland cumbria and the whole of our country now be the time to criminalise those who callously disregard the regulation and pollute our waterway be grateful to the government for sign new clause which and my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch first table we be both grateful to our hon friend the member for south basildon and east thurrock stephen metcalfe who move similar amendment in committee this be distress subject matter for an amendment to bill and we regret have to bring it to the attention of the house it relate to criminal trial in when david fuller as the minister mention be convict of the murder of two young woman in tunbridge wells wendy knell and caroline pierce in the that recent conviction follow forensic lead that eventually lead to his identification in the course of the police gathering of evidence for his murder conviction for which he receive whole life tariff video recording that fuller make of himself be find for context fuller be an electrician whose employment by the maidstone and tunbridge wells nhs trust give he access to hospital mortuary in which he film himself sexually assault the dead body of woman and girl there be over female victim of such abuse in the film discover in his possession they range in age from nine to some of fuller conviction be for the offence of sexually penetrate dead body which under the current law carry maximum sentence of only two year in prison as say it so happen that he receive whole life tariff for two particularly abhorrent murder for which he be convict but have that not be the case the maximum sentence available would have be two year for each offence the evidence gather by the police show that fuller also seriously sexually assault victim in non penetrative way will not go into detail but can tell the house that those crime be extensive and grave give that victim be identifiable more than member of this house spread right across the country have in their constituency the family of victim who be know to the police and to the nhs trust all fuller crime be frankly unspeakable but as well as the current sentencing limit be absurdly inadequate to deal with in effect the rape of dead body the law do not cover any form of sexual assault that be non penetrative in her opening speech the minister refer to its being unusual for the house to consider an area of criminal law that simply have not be address before there be clearly gap that hope all member will agree need to be close that be what we aim to do with the new clause this be one of the most harrowing piece of casework that have be involve in during my year in this house my right hon friend will remember that the gap as he have just refer to it be identify to we by one of the police officer who be involve in the horrific task of go through the evidence and who say that the case shake he to the core as be sure it would many people will my right hon friend join in pay tribute to the police officer and of course the civilian who support they in go through the evidence at forensic level which be sure many of we could not compute and certainly could not comprehend completely share my hon friend desire to pay tribute to the police officer who bring this gap in the law to our attention to all his colleague who have the painful duty of view the image and more generally to the family liaison officer who have to support the family of the victim and indeed the staff of the maidstone and tunbridge wells nhs trust who know in many case this individual be devastate to discover what have go on completely unknown to they the new clause will make an important change to the law it will increase the maximum sentence for the sexual penetration of dead body from two year to seven year and create new offence of sexual activity with corpse which will carry maximum sentence of five year to cover non penetrative offence victim of fuller be rob of their life and then their dignity and the victim family have be rob of adequate justice the devastation of the family of fuller victim have be heartbreaking as my hon friend and other colleague will know they suffer the death of their daughter sister niece aunt wife mother and grandmother then have lay they to rest and grieve for their lost life hundred receive knock on the door one night from the police who have to tell they that the body of person who be so precious to they have be desecrate in the most sickening way by this vile individual in place hospital mortuary that they think be sacrosanct safe and protect many will never get over the shock and disgust that they feel when that news be impart to they that evening it stay with they even now nor as my hon friend say will the police officer get over have to view every second of hundred of hour of video show the most depraved image that they have ever be confront with as my hon friend say one of the officer be in touch with we and call on we to close this gap in the law he his colleague and the family of the victim will never have restore to they the peace of mind that fuller destroy the family memory of their love one will be forever taint by association with the thought of what fuller do to they sadly we can not correct that in this house but we can ensure that the gravity of these offence be recognise be grateful to the minister for support our new clause and give it the government backing it be pleasure to see you in the chair mr deputy speaker thank the right hon member for tunbridge wells greg clark for speak on the issue for those of we who be on the bill committee many of we be present today it be in many case quite distress to hear of the experience that so many people have have over the year it be tribute to member present include those who be on the committee that they be here to listen to those experience my new clause and relate to traffic collision new clause be intend to require driver who be involve in collision with pedestrian cyclist or motorcyclist to remain at the scene of the collision and report it to the police or face the consequence of their decision not to new clause would reduce the amount of time that the driver involve have to report the collision from hour to two hour technology have move on the provision for hour be an old element of the road traffic act everybody have the capacity to report thing very quickly thank hon member who put their name to my new clause as say sit on the bill committee for several week we go through it line by line and as indicate we listen to harrowing and distressing account of the experience of victim victim who literally go from the cradle to the grave we have hear that again today colleague who speak in committee will no doubt bring those account to the attention of wide audience of hon member today we have just hear one such example those account be worth listen to for my part bring to the attention of colleague my reason for table my two new clause the group that have support in do so inclue roadpeace cycling uk and action vision zero there be westminster hall debate on november about two petition that have gather more than and name respectively call for tough sentence for as they be colloquially know hit and run driver who cause death and for the offence of cause death by dangerous driving to be widen to include failure to stop call and render aid on scene until further help arrive the department for transport say in response to the petition the government take this issue seriously the department for transport be look into the issue of such incident of failure to stop result in death or serious injury and explore whether there be further option that can be pursue that be well over two year ago what have the government do in response what have the department for transport do it appear to to be not great deal raise the issue of leave the scene of collision in the bill committee early this year do not push my new clause to vote then because understand that either the ministry of justice or the department for transport be work on the matter and could be liaise on it especially as the department for transport have already recognise that some assessment of the situation must be undertake and have ostensibly commit to do that lord paddick in the other place withdraw an amendment on november to the police crime sentencing and courts bill that would have amend the road traffic act because baroness williams of trafford say that her ministerial colleague at the department for transport understand the concern raise and be explore option include the available penalty and how the offence operate as part of long term and wide work on road safety official report house of lords november vol write to the minister early this year to say that be not tie to the letter of my new clause and the penalty therein but do not appear to have receive response which be regrettable if do receive response apologise but do not believe that do assume there be some liaison between department on the matter in committee set out in bit more detail why be pursue this issue go back to the point about how long it have be since the government have move on their position it be year since they say that they would undertake full review of traffic offence regrettably that have not happen yet there seem to be an irrefutable case for it what will it take for the government to look at these issue affect our constituent offer hon member few stat to put this matter into context every minute someone be kill or seriously injure on the road in the united kingdom that be stark figure if we average that out it mean that over year man woman and child have be kill or seriously injure in collision and there have be total of casualty right across the piece although accept that the number include very minor collision in year people be in britain and in northern ireland and be seriously injure road death have increase to pre pandemic level and serious injury be up stand to be correct on these figure but that be an average of people kill or seriously injure every year in each of our constituency meanwhile many driver simply leave the scene of the collision as many as people accord to the motor insurers bureau not all those case result in injury or fatality but there be family who know that their son daughter husband brother sister or relative be leave on the road dead or die by someone who just decide to go off if person decide to drive away and leave somebody dead or seriously injure on the road they must face the consequence of their decision that seem pretty simple and explain in due course why they leave the scene of the crime whatever the reason be they must face the consequence for do what they do in committee ask whether need to give hon member example of what family have have to go through do not want to because it be harrowing and distress enough to hear about they as the right hon member for tunbridge wells will know from the case he mention there be huge number of example and do not want to repeat they people know they do not need thing draw out graphically repeat what say in committee how would we reply to constituent who say that we have the power to take action would we say it shame but there nothing much can do about this sorry to hear that what if our constituent say you have the power the capacity and the wherewithal to change this would we just shrug that off and say nothing to do with sorry there nothing can do would we sit there in silence would we look at the datum and the information what would we do well know what want to do want to try to change the law so that those who leave other dead and die in the road be hold to account and face up to their action it be our solemn duty to protect our constituent if we can not protect they from people who decide to leave they dead or die we must at least try to send message for the sake of their family who seek not retribution but justice that be what want to do will finish with study by dr matt hopkins at the university of leicester who interview dozen of hit and run driver about why they fail to stop fair proportion of hit and run collision as they be call involve driver who do not have valid insurance and often do not have valid licence other be ban from drive at the time of the collision still other be under the influence of drink and drug they be try to avoid responsibility not just for potentially kill someone but for be drunk or on drug or whatever it be understand that people might leave in state of panic but they must none the less face up to their responsibility new clause and be an attempt to send the message out not in super dup emotional way be not try to threaten that if driver whatever the circumstance decide to leave the scene of an accident they must face the consequence be not wed to the sentence be five or six year in prison or to the amount of the fine we can debate and have dialogue about that or hop that we would but regrettably we have not that be why bring the new clause back today have not say that will push they to vote do not want to just want people to bear they in mind and to think about the impact that such action have on family those people must be hold to account know that this place can have reputation for be home to nothing more than punch and judy politic but in debate like these we see the good of this house as people raise their experience and those of their constituent and work often in cross party fashion to bring forward change to legislation that will have the right sort of tangible impact for everyone across our country on that basis will support number of amendment include those of my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington elliot colburn and my right hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes and of course the new clause that my right hon friend the member for tunbridge wells greg clark and my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch table in committee which be glad the government accept it will be of no surprise to anybody in the house that rise today to speak to new clause before go any far thank the minister for her kind word about my dad hope that she will not mind my say that her own father her constituency predecessor would be sure be incredibly proud of the work that she be do in her ministerial post and in her constituency hope that the house will forgive and indulge as tell hopefully for one last time in the chamber the story of my dad dominic davison be year old self employ stonemason brilliant dad brilliant family man and great friend to all who know he on friday night in he go to the pub with his friend and never come home regrettably he be involve in an altercation that result in his receive one fatal blow to the head blow so significant that he be dead before he even hit the ground that be why have dedicate much of my campaigning time since then to try prevent other family from have to go through the horror and shock that my family have to go through however today be not about my dad or my family as have campaign this issue have transform from something deeply personal into something much great it be about the resilience of all the family who have experience such horrific tragedy and have push through and who be now campaign for change it be only right that pay tribute to the incredible work of maxine thompson curl and her partner tony who run the one punch uk charity base in the brilliant north east that initiative come from another terrible tragedy maxine have long speak of the story of her son kristian who be in his late teen when he die as the designated driver great lad he have go to pick up his mate from nightclub and go to the loo while they be finish their drink guy approach he in the toilet and ask whether he have cigarette he say no the result be that kristian receive single blow to the head he fall over and hit his head on the ground and be in coma for believe about month before regrettably pass away maxine have dedicate her entire life since then to campaign not only for improvement to the criminal justice system but for improved awareness more broadly so that few people out there feel that the first step they should take if they be aggravate or frustrated be to raise their fist the work of one punch uk include go into school to talk to young people about the danger that can arise from that one split second moment of silly action which can ruin not only the life of those who lose their love one but the life of the person who throw that blow commend those at the charity for their work in talk to family from right across the country in constituency far and wide we have pull out few key theme on where the system be not work as it should and as many of we would expect regrettably the core theme be sentence there be few case that can raise shaun hardy perpetrator receive sentence of just month lee burns perpetrator receive two year suspend sentence and robert holland receive sentence of three and half year there have in recent year be improvement to the length of sentence pass but even now it be believe that the average sentence for take life through that kind of violent punch be around four year the question that we in this house must ask ourselves be what be the price of life what be the price of lose love one can safely say from experience that no sentence will ever be enough to make up for the tragedy trauma and anguish face by individual who have lose love one like that but four year be not justice it be nothing short of insult table new clause to improve sentencing not just to bring sense of justice for the family impact by these horrific crime but to improve faith in our wide criminal justice system which we know be face difficulty among member of the public the new clause be base on legislation introduce in number of australian state we have use very similar wording to try to make it as specific as possible be incredibly grateful for the engagement from the ministry of justice and the home office include from the secretary of state for justice the home secretary and of course my hon friend the minister appreciate their concern about create discrepancy in the law for example our new clause talk specifically about punch so if someone be to be slap forcefully and fall over backwards the clause would not apply of course do not want to allow emotion to dominate when we be ultimately here in this house as legislator to make the good law and have the good possible impact for our constituent have be very grateful for the strong level of engagement throughout my campaign on one punch awareness and one punch uk offer our thank to the government and to members right across the house who have get involve in our campaign come to our awareness day and sign amendment to improve thing for family go through these horrific tragedy for their engagement do not intend to press my new clause to vote because the government have again be grateful for this come forward with wonderful package of measure that we believe will make brilliant and tangible difference for the family impact by such horrendous tragedy for example we have be offer full review of low culpability homicide take into account not just single punch but any single blow and other such crime to look at whether or not sentencing review be need of course we would like that review to get start as quickly as possible and know that the minister recognise the urgency with which we have be campaign on this matter and one punch uk look forward to work with she and the victims commissioner to get that review under way will be on their back make sure that it be strong review with strong recommendation and will be push for the government to accept the recommendation at the end of the process sentencing itself be only part of the picture because one of the difficulty we have experience be the expectation gap in sentencing let we go on journey from the perspective of someone whose love one be lose the first moment be the knock on the door to say that your loved one have be kill and the second moment be learn the reason why the third moment be learn that the case be go to go to criminal trial at that point in your mind it do not matter what rational explanation you have be give your loved one have be murder so your expectation be that murder charge will be bring and the defendant will go away for life it be emotional it be not rational but that be the true experience of victim to then find out that low charge of manslaughter will be put forward and that the charge will be low culpability manslaughter mean that the average sentence will be more along the line of four year be an incredibly difficult journey for any victim to go on most good law abide family do not have intense experience of the criminal justice system nor should they as such one of the thing we have be push for be single point of contact specialise in one punch assault to be that hand hold guide from day one through to the trial and beyond so that those expectation can be deal with right from the get go in order to avoid that horrific expectation gap and the feeling of betrayal by the criminal justice system on that basis be incredibly pleased that the government have appoint rob kirby to that role as part of the national police chiefs council look forward to meet he and work with he to design his workstream to make sure that we get that work under way as soon as possible ultimately the end goal be to stop as many family as possible from have to go through that journey in the future awareness be absolutely key and once more must praise the work of one punch uk it go into school and educate young people and it go into prison and talk to perpetrator about how they can turn their life around there be an individual who must also praise his name be jacob dunne jacob be perpetrator who throw single punch and go to prison he turn his life around and he now fight for restorative justice he himself go and speak to young adult who have make bad choice to encourage they that there be well way recently he have work with james graham to produce play at the nottingham playhouse call punch which be look forward to see tomorrow well say that imagine it be go to be intensely emotional but do look forward to see it because think it will be really positive step in raise awareness and hopefully discourage anyone else from raise their fist at the wrong moment on the point of raise awareness once again be very grateful to the ministry of justice and the home office for commit to fund further tranche of the walk away campaign that be public awareness campaign and they be allow to help co design it alongside one punch uk to make sure we spread the message to the maximum possible number of people that raise your fist be not the right answer once again be very grateful to all colleague who sign new clause would of course have like it to be accept and to see it pass but all of we in this place know that we can not let the perfect get in the way of the good if someone have tell at the start of this campaign that we would achieve what we have manage to achieve today would have bite their arm off be recently ask whether consider this package of measure to be my legacy absolutely do not mainly because be not go to stop campaign on this issue even when have leave this place it be the legacy of all those family who have lose love one of all those campaigner who have fight for change and of course of my dad dominic know that he would be as grateful as be to the government for the positive step that they have bring forward today rise will call member whose amendment have be select for separate decision first call jess phillips be not expect it to be thank you madam deputy speaker have table amendment be sure everybody in this house will be delighted to hear that will not be push all of they to vote because we could be here all night if do many people have put in great amount of work include the previous speaker the hon member for bishop auckland dehenna davison wonder whether in she sum up the minister could give we some idea of whether the bill will ever make it on to the statute book because we be all work hard to put thing into law but we potentially have just week leave in this place and it be pretty long bill to get through the lords be worried about progress be stall and about whether we be waste our breath but here be and will waste mine new clause which stand in my name seek to replace the term control prostitution for gain with sexual exploitation of an adult and to provide definition of adult exploitation in the sexual offences act in significant change be make through the serious crime act whereby control child prostitute or child involve in pornography be replace with the term sexual exploitation of child child who be once label prostitute be recognise as be child who have be groom and abuse and who be in desperate need of support unfortunately no such change occur for adult victim of sexual exploitation note the early conversation on the issue of cuckooing and the importance of understanding that person can be groom and coerce the people who rent or own property in that circumstance would be adult so we do recognise that adult can be groom it just be not reflect in our law in fact new clause which also stand in my name talk about that as well sexual exploitation occur when individual or group take advantage of an imbalance of power to coerce manipulate or deceive person into sexual activity that be often do in exchange for something that the victim need or want and it will disproportionately benefit the perpetrator the impact on life be devastating one case study from the stage group highlight the sudden change in perception of sexual exploitation as person reach adulthood meena be when she be introduce to her perpetrator he begin supply she with alcohol and drug to the point she develop dependency on alcohol he use her fear around shame as form of control to ensure she do not speak out about the abuse he would subject she to between the age of meena be see as victim of cse and professional do all they could to safeguard she at the exploitation be continue however since move into adult service the police and adult social care have question whether meena be just make unwise choice and whether she be get something out of these exchange meena have miss episode she be locate follow sexual assault however the respond police officer inform her support worker that this experience can not be sexual exploitation because meena be over the lack of legal definition and the continue label of sexual exploitation of adult as control prostitution for gain have lead to the continue abuse of countless woman like meena and to the lack of response from safeguard agency new clause would play vital role in change the perception of adult victim of exploitation as have say new clause would make an aggravating factor of the grooming in these case adult case just as we do in case of childhood sexual exploitation since the stage partnership against adult sexual exploitation which declare be the chair of have support over adult woman who have experience grooming and that be just in the north east and yorkshire stage work have confirm that grooming be common technique use to manipulate people for sexual exploitation there be considerable overlap in the perpetrator behaviour and tactic with those see in case of child sexual grooming and it have devastating negative impact on people ability to consent and make capacitate decision it be deliberate process of limit the freedom of person by gain control over they and create dependency however for adult who have experience grooming it be often reduce to make poor life choice because of the belief that groom can only happen to child adult victim of groom be repeatedly ask victim blame question such as why do you get back in the car why do you stay with they why do you leave do not know if member of this house have see the tv programme baby reindeer but it be one of the good example have ever see it be interesting because it be about man and therefore think that as nation we might be more ready to believe it there be an incident where he go back to somebody with more power than he who have hold over he in his career and be feed he drug for dependency he go back but under our current law he would not be consider to have be groom that would not be mitigate factor in any case that he could take if he be child it would be mitigate factor nobody be argue against that the hon lady be make an important point all of this come back to how we view vulnerability because it display itself in very different way in almost all these case there be some base vulnerability and drug addict or person who have be accuse of various thing realise that on balance they have well do what they be tell or coerce into that be the real point be it not absolutely agree and it can truly happen to anybody we have see how people even in this house can be coerce into thing it be dangerous if there be criminal charge for blackmail sexual violence or whatever against person groom should be an aggravating factor regardless of age on the basis as the right hon gentleman rightly say of differential of vulnerability until groom of adult be recognise in legislation it will continue to be misunderstood by law enforcement and the criminal justice system and victim will not be adequately protect new clause would essentially decriminalise the offence of loitering or solicit for the purpose of prostitution and repeal section of the street offences act ten of thousand of sex trade survivor who be convict of that offence endure violence and abuse from punter and pimp or they be criminalise for offence arise from their exploitation the exploiter and abuser remain at liberty continue to offend while we criminalise the victim in one case be tell of young woman be when she be first exploit into prostitution by man pose as her boyfriend he become her pimp and as well as sexually abuse she himself he make her sell sex on the street where she often fear for her life for year she suffer violence and abuse from her pimp and punter and be regularly arrest by the police while they exchange friendly greeting with her pimp that by the way be essentially protect under the law in our land at the moment which need some heavy review as consequence of that history which date back to the she have conviction for soliciting and loitering which will remain on her record for life despite she have exit prostitution more than year ago she be one of thousand of woman who have live through that experience time have change those in much of street prostitution be now widely understand to be the victim and they be usually no long arrest the new clause would provide the necessary recognition that woman convict of such offence be not criminal it would ensure that the uk complie with international human right obligation to woman exploit in prostitution and it would replicate the majority of council of europe state that have fully legalise or decriminalised prostitution or adopt the sex buyer model which decriminalise only those exploit and not those who profit or benefit from prostitution new clause which be connect to new clause would create mechanism for those who receive conviction for loitering and solicit for the purpose of prostitution to have they disregarded we have see quite push in the house regard the criminalisation of people from the post office and quite rightly to have those conviction quash be ask we to consider those young child and very vulnerable woman who be criminalise because that will remain on their criminal record until the survivor reach the age of it mean that woman who be convict continue to be disadvantage by the mandatory retention of such record as result of be historically subject to violence and exploitation despite recent change to the disclosure regime woman be still at risk of those record be disclose in certain circumstance in the post office drama one woman could not go into her kid school to do painting session we be talk about woman who have be exploit not be able to go into our kid school new clause argue that strangulation should be see as an aggravating factor in the sentencing of murderer and the minister seek to address some of these issue work with many family of murder woman many of they speak to of the horror of how their love one be kill by strangulation strangulation be not weapon weapon have different sentencing regime and in this instance man strength be their weapon he bring weapon by bring the strength to strangle and kill somebody we have go over the debate and the amazing work of carole gould and julie devey look at the differentiation between those who kill stranger or anyone in the street with knife get year minimum sentence and someone who kill their wife with knife in their home get year minimum sentence that be fundamentally wrong schedule to the sentencing act need massive review but one thing we could definitely do be put in aggravate factor specifically on strangulation as clare wade suggest we debate new clause and extensively in committee and they relate to whether victim of domestic violence deserve defence in the law imagine this matter will get an even big run out in the lords many learn member of the other place very much wish to see these mitigation for case where woman commit crime as result of the pattern of abuse they have suffer look forward to that be the ongoing debate down there we do not debate new clause in committee so will just talk about it like it as policy because it do not cost anything which the minister will be pleased to hear it call for the sentencing code to be amend to require judge to consider make compensation order where there be evidence of economic loss or damage as result of the offence know from my constituent and the charity survive economic abuse that even when survivor be lucky enough to have her case reach court and her abuser hand prison sentence she have to live with the long last impact of the abuse some million uk woman have have their money and belonging control by their current or former partner in the past month many economic abuse survivor often end up homeless destitute and with damaged credit score that prevent they from rebuild their life while the sentencing code require judge to consider award compensation when make their judgment in reality they do not research by survive economic abuse look at successful controlling or coercive behaviour prosecution that feature economic abuse between and and it find that despite evidence of loss and damage cause by the perpetrator just of case result in the perpetrator be order to pay compensation new clause would help ensure that judge consider whether compensation order be appropriate in case of economic abuse that be the end of my amendment however my right hon and learn friend the member for camberwell and peckham ms harman have have many mention today she can not be here today but she have ask to make some remark on new clause on her behalf make they very much on my behalf too with one particular question to the minister have already ask she about the age be under if somebody come to and say that the father of their child have rap year old do not think they would be particularly happy that they still have to go through the family court process so very much hope that when the minister say this be an iterative process that will actually be the case there be still massive safeguarding issue new clause would change the law to protect the child of convict child sex offender by take away their father parental right that would be hugely significant and would lay down that fatherhood be privilege not right and that people will forfeit it if they be danger to their child that would be major change the patriarchal hangover whereby father right over child be sacrosanct will at long last give way to the priority of protect the child it have long be recognise that child need protect from sex offender while in the we bring forward protection for child through the sex offender register and restriction on people who have be convict of serious sexual offence we do not tackle parental right and protect the offender own child somehow the patriarchal view that father right over their own child must not be disturb be carve out obviously that be wrong because the right of the child not the right of the father should be at the forefront recent family court case in cardiff put spotlight on that when the father of bethan daughter be send to prison for child sexual abuse bethan be horrify to discover that despite be in prison he still have right over their child when he be sentence he be give an order ban he from any future contact with child but that ban do not extend to his own child bethan spend go through the family court fight to protect her child from he the court and the law should step forward to protect child it should not be leave to the mother especially because in most of these case the mother will be victim as well the court should strip the father who have do the offending of right over his child as the government have say they be adopt this change have already say that have concern about some of the limitation with regard to the offence type let we be honest do not believe in the right of fatherhood when parent be abusive at all when work with my right hon and learn friend there be lot of message that be what it be always like the drafting of the legislation have essentially be copy and paste from previous campaign that we work on with regard to jade law on homicide and there be worry about the drafting of propose new section to the children act which require local authority to make an application to the family court to review the decision to remove the sex offend father parental right in every case even when there be no issue at all with the mother in her closing remark will the minister address that rise order urge colleague to be considerate of each other in the length of time that they be take be try to ensure that we get everybody in and the debate will finish at pm so that mean that colleague have about to minute each rise to speak in favour of new clause and what be new clause which have be copy by the government in new clause and on cuckoo have discuss the matter very much welcome the fact that the government have essentially adopt my original new clause some modification have take place and agree with all of those it be critical that cuckooing be an offence in itself when we talk to the police about it they be clear throughout that they could not get into house where there be problem or even perhaps criminal activity be take place because there be no offence of have take over the house it will make the police job great deal easy if they do not have to be able to demonstrate suspicion that criminal act be take place in the house they will simply have to believe that the house have essentially be cuckoo they will then be able to go in and discover lot of stuff many criminal take over these house for the simple reason that they know it will take the police while to get their act together and be able to get inside that action will be speed up which think ultimately will help the police dramatically make the point to the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips that vulnerability play massive part in all this who know what vulnerability be but some victim have drug alcohol physical and mental health problem and may have other learn difficulty and other disability we forget about the learning disability element but vulnerability can encompass somebody lifelong failure through all education system and everything else they be vulnerable but they may not display those vulnerability to the public cognisance therefore cuckoo use someone to take over their house be what happen hide behind those door the victim go unnoticed build on that point do my right hon friend accept that sometimes vulnerable people might appear to be exactly the opposite they might put up façade of great confidence or even of arrogance include in the criminal justice process which have witness as magistrate we need to look carefully behind that to assess whether someone be arrogant or vulnerable could not agree more that be why be insistent that the government be clear in the guidance that coercion and other act negate the idea that superficially the individual be declare to have give their permission that need to be investigate more deeply by the police before they say it all right they give their say so it be fine it be not fine that vulnerability need to be examine be grateful to my hon friend for make that point and be grateful to the minister for make it clear at the beginning that that will be in the guidance research from the centre for social justice and justice and care highlight that despite the terrible impact on victim take control of person home in this way be not specifically crime the specific offence of cuckooing be therefore need to rectify the harm do it have be claim endlessly that civil order do the job but they do not because they be short term they can be obtain quickly but they be not last and do not do anything perpetrator be back into the process because they be not criminal order that be the point if we make this criminal offence suddenly these perpetrator will have to think twice be be brief because welcome the government decision to amend their own bill and put it into law be grateful for that and it will be celebrate up and down the land by many people who have feel abandon the issue be link in many sens to what the hon member for birmingham yardley say early about vulnerability it may open wide debate about how vulnerability be recognise in criminal law new clause would create an offence of cause death by serious injury and dangerous careless or inconsiderate cycling if accept it would ensure that cyclist be hold accountable for their action enhance road safety and provide justice for victim and their family simply it try to bring in what have for some reason be completely leave out of the normal criminal code and highway code with regard to some of problem cause by the increase in cycling let make it clear that be very keen for more cycling to take place it be good for individual and the environment recognise all that this be not anti cycling despite what many people say about it quite the opposite it be about make sure that cycling be safe and reasonable want to raise the case of matthew briggs who have be campaign for law recognise death and serious injury he be in the gallery witness these event his attempt to get cyclist prosecute after his wife be kill in central london in involve legal process so convoluted and difficult that even the preside judge have say since she have retire that it make mockery of the law it need to be address that the law do not cover what happen to matthew wife and lot of other people they have to use victorian law make in about about wanton and furious driving which refer to horse riding nothing have be do ever since it be quite different offence to be frank and it certainly be not about cycling as far back as the it be recognise that jury be slow to convict in motor manslaughter case that be recognise in report that will come to in second which lead to major change in the law for driver the case for change the law on cyclist be now urgent by the way it be not just say that back in the department for transport commission an independent inquiry into this very issue some of the point it make be really relevant but nothing have be do since it state there be persuasive case for legislative change to tackle the issue of dangerous and careless cycling that cause serious injury or death in order to bring cycling into line with drive offence it be interesting that it refer to number of country that do incorporate that it have not lead to fall in cycling in those country it be still increase but it be do on lawful basis the report quote barrister this be key component consider that this legislative change would have positive effect on all road user they go on to say that it would have positive impact purely and simply on the basis of cyclist be well aware that if they be to ride in careless or dangerous manner and be unfortunate enough to kill someone law would proceed against they they go on to say would like to think that it would have positive impact for people to think be go to slow down not go to do anything stupid because it could put they in danger with the law as say that independent report be from but nothing have be do since that have make this more important matthew briggs and other campaigner often have face lot of abuse from people who simply do not want change to happen it be time for we to recognise the impact of this issue under the current law even if someone on bike have kill pedestrian they can only be jail for maximum of two year that create clear discrepancy between different form of dangerous behaviour on road and the punishment do not always fit the severity of the crime or achieve justice for victim in one case mr justice mitting state if the vehicle ride by the suspect have be motorise he would have have no defence to charge of cause death by dangerous driving an offence which carry maximum sentence of year imprisonment there have be call for legislative change for some time mention the report but the number be grow it be worth look at some other case which show that mr briggs case be far from isolated family who have lose love one or who have suffer injury be desperate for change in july peter mccombie be kill by cyclist ermir loka who have jump red light in june stewart mcginn be jail for year after he speed on his bike around corner in monmouth south wales hit jane stone who die four day later in june hilda griffiths this be very important case who be age be run over by cyclist who be race along at mph in mph zone on high performance racing bike she subsequently die the extent of hilda injury be so severe that all the nhs medical professional at st mary hospital could not believe that the collision have be with bicycle at the time they think they have misread the note and that it must have be motorbike or vehicle that cause such extensive life threaten injury the case be unable to proceed because the speed limit do not apply to cyclist these anomaly need to be resolve on may meet paolo dos santos who be knock unconscious after she be hit by speed cyclist who be overtake car overtake car at the same spot she suffer several facial injury and now require reconstruction surgery for her upper jaw socket without initial surgery she would have lifelong discomfort and pain and would not be able to use her mouth properly to chew or anything else in diana walker die when cyclist hit she in pewsey wiltshire in june ian gunn die in south manchester yet the cyclist be clear of wanton and furious driving it be interesting be talk about not just death but injury hope colleague note the age of most of the victim it be old people who be affect and it be worth recognise that this be real problem the department for transport produce statistic on pedestrian involve in road collision in great britain as report by or to the police between and pedestrian casualty in great britain occur in collision involve pedal cycle of those nine be fatal be very serious injury and be injury the number of pedestrian hit by cyclist have increase by third since and in the most recent year for which figure be available collision between cyclist and pedestrian be record by police accord to datum from nhs england pedestrian be admit to hospital after collision with cyclist between and six of those patient be over the age of and be under the age of four we can see pattern here the elderly and the very young be become the people most affected it should also be bear in mind that most of these injury and accident be not report to the police because most people do not think anything will happen unlike motor accident although take the point make early by the hon member for bootle peter dowd that even motorist try to abscond will my right hon friend give way will but very briefly in view of your stricture madam deputy speaker may make specific point about road traffic accident we be debate criminal justice bill and we be discuss support for victim the maximum penalty for drive without insurance be fine or six point on the driver licence unless the case go to court in which case driver can receive unlimited fine and be disqualify from drive irrespective of whether their offence be the first or the should we not address that aspect as well with the aim of make our road safe hope my hon friend will forgive if do not go down that road at this particular point because be deal with very focused new clause but think that as minimum we need to bring matter back into balance and allow ordinary pedestrian and other to recognise that there be problem that need to be rectify hope the government will do that there have be an explosion in the number of electric bike the other day watch as someone on an electric bike pass small primary school just at the last moment avoid the child who be come in and out of it genuinely believe that he must have be do over mile an hour coat flap in the wind not care in the world wear no protection and certainly with no concern for those young child it give quite shock to many of the mother who be stand there watch with astonishment at the arrogance of the cyclist it have be report that some of these bike have be adapt so that they can go fast than the legal speed limit for vehicle these be not simply retrospective issue they be develop issue believe that the new clause will achieve equal accountability driver be hold accountable for dangerous driving result in death and cyclist should face similar consequence for reckless behaviour that lead to fatality it will achieve deterrence because strict penalty for dangerous cycling will act as deterrent and it will achieve justice and closure for the family of victim who deserve it outdated law that do not adequately address cycling relate fatality can leave they bereft finally it will achieve public safety because update traffic law can contribute to safe road environment for all user include pedestrian cyclist and motorist new clause stand not only in my name but in those of many colleague on both side of the house and recommend it to the government recognise that it be not perfect as be suggest by the hon member for stockton north alex cunningham but hope that the government will adopt it give that it can be modify in the other place if necessary not to adopt it now be to deny that there be problem intend to press it when the time come but we do not have to divide on it because hope and believe that there be chance of the government adopt it which would be relevant and good position to take let end by commend matt briggs he have campaign bravely for some time and have be vilify by many party who do not want this to be do his wife die and he have be without she for number of year but he have never relent in his campaign just over week ago hear he speak on radio and his testimony so move that decide we have to start act now make no apology for that as have say the new clause be by no mean perfect but action be well than inaction in so many case would like to speak in support of new clause which be in my name it seek to amend the road traffic act to provide that dangerous careless or inconsiderate driving offence may be commit on private land adjacent to highway be grateful to my hon friend the member for swansea east carolyn harris for present and support my new clause in committee and for the positive comment in committee from colleague on the shadow front bench and the government front bench as outline by my hon friend the member for stockton north alex cunningham early should like to give some background to the new clause in august month old child pearl melody black from merthyr tydfil be tragically kill when walk with her father and brother pearl be kill by an unoccupied vehicle that roll from private drive in merthyr tydfil on to the highway and down hill before crash into wall that subsequently crush pearl and injure her father and brother in the month after the incident officer from the serious collision unit of south wales police work tirelessly to put case together to provide justice for the family in short all test conclude that the car be mechanically sound and that it have roll because the handbrake be not fully engage and the automatic transmission be not fully place into park mode the case be send to the crown prosecution service and work on by the london office as well as by the independent qc hire by the cps to consult everyone be hopeful of conviction under the death by dangerous driving category the cps also look into other possible option in june however the cps state that it be unable to send the case to court because glitch in the law state that in order to bring prosecution under the road traffic act the vehicle must have start its journey on public road so even though pearl be kill on public road the fact that the vehicle start its descent from private drive mean that prosecution be not possible the coroner state that the vehicle be well maintain and that it seem that the issue be very much one of driver operation the inquest hear that the handbrake have not be fully apply in park mode the inquest into pearl death be hear in october and the outcome be that it have be an accident however with the support of south wales police and the cps pearl parent have seek to change the law and they continue to do so so that other family be not in similar situation of not be able to secure justice due to legal loophole follow such tragic and completely preventable incident as gemma and paul black acknowledge as the legislation would not be retrospective it would not help to bring justice for pearl but prevent anyone else from suffer such an injustice might provide some comfort introduce ten minute rule bill to amend the act and that bill have cross party support however as with most ten minute rule bills it fall due to lack of parliamentary time new clause in this criminal justice bill would allow for the change to be make it be wholly wrong that in case such as the tragic one have outline justice can not be achieve where there can be no conviction simply because the land on which the incident take place be not classify as public if the law on drive offence occur on private land adjoin public land be change it would be powerful deterrent to road user show carelessness as well as to those who have no doubt exploit the current loophole in the law to avoid conviction when they have undoubtedly be at fault people would be likely to take more care and pay more attention when drive or parking on private land close to public land in the knowledge that there could be serious consequence for careless or reckless behaviour there be instance where private land adjoin public land be regularly use and potentially dangerous to those around it these area include residential driveway as have outline as well as school nursery supermarket shopping centre and doctor surgery to name some of the most common when we consider some of these example we can see that drive on that specific category of land can present high risk to people in everyday situation especially child the elderly and some of the most vulnerable among we be sure that all hon and right hon member would agree that nobody who have suffer the loss of love one or have an accident or injury as result of drive offence should have to endure the injustice of see those responsible go free simply because of loophole in the law prosecution for drive offence and indeed any illegal action should be base on what happen not where it happen be hopeful that if these change be make it would give people such as gemma and paul black and many other the peace of mind that there be consequence for dangerous driving no matter where it occur and it would help to prevent such needless and avoidable tragedy the criminal justice bill be the first opportunity in number of year to amend the road traffic act understand that the ministry of justice be supportive but as it relate primarily to transport it be for the department for transport to provide workaround be therefore grateful to the road minister the hon member for hexham guy opperman for meet my constituent paul and gemma black few week ago he offer some hope and he offer to do what he can to help be also grateful for the positive conversation with the under secretary of state for the home department the hon member for newbury laura farris although there have be work on this complex issue there be no definitive progress as yet perhaps the minister could give some indication as to the government current thinking when she wind up the debate will continue to chase progress because believe this be matter of common sense and justice hope the government will offer some support hope and peace of mind for my constituent paul and gemma and no doubt for many other across the constituency before speak to new clause and in my name want to say that it be huge honour and privilege to serve in committee where we do huge amount of work on the bill we can all see element of the bill that affect our constituency in chelmsford outlaw the scanner that thief use to intercept car key signal so that they can drive away with our vehicle be welcome essex police and crime commissioner have campaign for the new knife crime law along with other have campaign and lobby the minister for the amendment she table on spike also support the amendment before we today on huge range of matter include the one on dangerous cycling cuckooing and revenge porn this show the bill incredibly wide scope which provide an opportunity to update crucial law in so many area faint hearted or cowardly ministers would not have give we bill with such broad scope they would have shy away from it fear have so many amendment and so many area of controversy they would have fear colleague table amendment to play political game and they would not have take the risk minister have do the right thing by introduce bill with such broad scope they recognise that even the good law sometimes need fresh pair of eye because situation change and they want our law in this country to be the good they can possibly be thank they for not shy away from the work and for be so brave in allow these discussion to happen my amendment be far from play political game they propose extremely important law to protect child from the vilest of vile crime child sexual abuse and particularly online child sexual abuse there be good reason why for so many decade it have be illegal for people to have image of child sexual abuse on their computer because we know that people who look at this sort of content be more likely to step from the visual world into the real world to abuse child would argue that people who abuse child in the virtual world be even more likely to go on to abuse real child new clause would update our law on paedophile manual to include ai generate material new clause which would also update the law for the rapid evolution of ai would make it illegal to use digital tool such as bot or avatar to simulate sexual communication with child this would include act such as create bot or avatar to rape child in the digital world thank the internet watch foundation for its work on these new clause which be support by the police lead on child sexual abuse and other artificial intelligence be develop extraordinarily rapidly there have be an explosion in ai content and the consequence of that in the dark world of child sexual abuse be devastating ai generate image be become so widespread on the internet that when the iwf conduct snapshot study between september and october of just one dark web forum it discover that more than ai generate image of child sexual abuse have be upload in just that one month on that one forum these image be now so realistic that it be incredibly difficult for law enforcement agency to tell the difference between real image of real child who need real safeguarding and those that have be generate use ai turn to new clause under section of the sexual offences act it be an offence to communicate sexually with child the new clause create new offence of simulate sexual activity with child this include use create or share bot or other tool to simulate sexual communication with child be tell that in online paedophile community there be always desire to utilise technology to bring the fantasy of child sexual abuse close to reality the evolution of ai technology be see as the ultimate solution it be grim it allow child abuser to feel as close to the sensation of interact with and abuse real child as possible without actually commit the physical act of abuse child however just as we know that person who regularly view image of csa be more likely to sexually abuse real child it be absolutely clear that person who abuse virtual child or direct an online companion or bot to do so be much more likely to go on to abuse real one my right hon friend be deal with an issue that demonstrate the type of issue pervade all of this bill again pay tribute to all the people who serve on the bill committee and deal with such difficult range of issue as they have do great service to our house on behalf of all of we who serve on the committee thank my right hon friend for that should say that the ministers and shadow ministers do huge amount of work on the bill to put it simply the online act of abuse lower the bar to physical offending there be huge concern regard the development of ai chatbot and the ease speed and quality with which text to image base generative ai tool have be develop furthermore it be important to recognise that this be become risk to massive number of child the national crime agency estimate that approximately to people in the uk between and of the adult population pose some form of sexual threat to child android and ios app store have plentiful supply of ai companion app they enable the user to create an imaginary online friend to choose what that friend look like and to direct what they do the three large app have already receive well over million download each within minute of download one of these popular app law enforcement operative be able to have an interactive communication with an ai chatbot discuss the abduction sexual abuse torture and murder of an eight year old girl furthermore through monitor offender discussion online we know that technically capable user be actively build ai chatbot companion specifically for the purpose of have realistic paedophilic role play involve ai child avatar ian critchley the national police lead on child protection have warn that the metaverse create gateway for predator to commit horrific crime against child there be many story of child avatar have be subject to the most hideous of rape in evidence to the education committee of which be member the children commissioner describe child who have virtually experienced be rap and sexually abuse she say that we must not think that that type of rape be not traumatic just because it happen in an online world it be traumatic it be abuse and it can be part of grooming she warn we legislator to not underestimate the safeguarding issue the type of behaviour that we be discuss normalise the sexual abuse of child it encourage those with sexual thought about child to act on their urge we know that this type of behaviour can and do lead to contact offending in the future it put real child at risk of significant harm that will impact they for their whole life furthermore madam deputy speaker you will be concern to hear that many ai generate tool have be train on real material involve real child that type of interaction be far from be victimless crime it be clear that ai chatbot technology have to be more tightly control it need to be regulate at present there be no responsibility place on individual or entity who create or share these vile digital tool let alone on those who use they my amendment will change that new clause cover paedophile manual there be an exist offence of possess guide to the sexual abuse of child so call paedophile manual the new clause would update legislation so that it refer to guide give advice on create child sexual abuse content use generative artificial intelligence or machine learning section of the serious crime act prohibit the creation distribution and use of paedophile manual however the legislation be applicable only to direction on the sexual abuse of real child it specifically omit pseudo photograph it make no reference to direct people on how to use technology such as text to image generative ai or machine learning to create child sexual abuse material or to provide hint and tip on how to create such image one recent page manual contain detailed instruction on how to extort image and video from adolescent the guide advise people to first ask the child to share image of they wear swimwear bikini or underwear once those image have be obtain the guide discuss how to use nudifye ai technology to remove the clothing from the child it then explain how to blackmail the victim into send nude image of themselves and how to use those image for sextortion it also contain information on the device app and website that perpetrator can use to protect themselves from detection sextortion be another crime that be grow incredibly quickly the national centre for missing exploited children in the us report case of sextortion globally in compare to just the year before there have also be an explosion of case in the uk the national crime agency recently write to all school about the grow risk of sextortion hon member may have hear about the recent case of year old murray dowey from dunblane who die by suicide after become victim of sextortion it be heinous and grow crime scourge just imagine how much bad it will become if we allow it to become rocket fuel by ai alter image new clause will ensure that our law cover digitally generate image and the digital generation of material finally thank the government for new clause which introduce duty to report child sexual offence however would just say to the minister that further clarity on how that provision work in practice be very important amendment be not schedule to be discuss today hope the minister can confirm that the government will introduce an amendment on paedophile manual in the other place know that colleague in the other place intend to re table the amendment hope that the government will accept amendment do not think that the government whip want to call on conservative colleague to walk through the no lobby against an amendment tackle the rape of child shall listen closely to what the minister say in her closing speech this afternoon we have hear about some really strong amendment that would strengthen the criminal justice bill but other amendment seek to criminalise homelessness far restrict peaceful protest and vastly expand police surveillance power today wish to focus on new clause in my name which continue the campaign to fix the law on joint enterprise begin my campaign with support from the amazing campaigner at jengba liberty and many other for my private member bill back in february be grateful to receive the support of nearly colleague who back this amendment as well as commitment from my front bench team back in february that labour will seek to review and reform joint enterprise as and when we get into power charge of joint enterprise too often lead to an assumption of guilt in the courtroom the defendant be force to prove their innocence which turn our justice system on its head that be failure of our justice system supposedly the good in the world and an affront to the taxpayer who be leave foot the bill for sloppy sentencing my amendment would enshrine in law the concept that person can be prosecute under joint enterprise only where they be prove to have significantly contribute to crime that would raise the bar for prosecution and would provide the jury with the tool to differentiate between defendant who deserve to face mandatory life sentence for their role in serious crime and those who do not this miscarriage of justice be bad than the post office horizon scandal because it involve child as young as be convict and incarcerate for crime that they do not commit and be give whole life sentence with little or no option for appeal campaign by jengba and liberty lead to six month pilot datum collection project by the crown prosecution service which have now agree to roll out the scheme fully and permanently analysis of the original datum reveal that more than half of those prosecute under joint enterprise be age under with black youth time more likely to be prosecute under joint enterprise law than their white counterpart personally welcome the commitment from the director of public prosecutions to far investigate these disparity the evidence clearly show that the legislation be be widely use as dragnet to maximise conviction we need only scrutinise the old baily daily court list to witness how widespread this practice be joint enterprise allow the prosecution to use racist gang narrative to imply guilt and to persuade jury use prejudicial stereotype in place of cold hard evidence in way that be often compare to russian roulette human right group liberty submit one such case last year to the criminal cases review commission after defendant all black be collectively convict and sentence to total of year in prison for single murder evidence include rap video make online year early photo of some of the defendant use hand sign and the allege favouring of the colour red hope that the ccrc which twice reject andrew malkinson request to review will look at this request more favourably in that and similar case the prosecution call police officer to give their opinion as expert on alleged gang culture concept that still evade legal definition but carry with it racist stereotype intend to sway jury that be extremely prejudicial consider the relationship that the police have with black community and consider that black people be disproportionately represent in the criminal justice system new datum from expert at manchester metropolitan university have reveal that nearly million be spend each year on process defendant in joint enterprise case an average of people every single year be convict under joint enterprise the total cost to the taxpayer of their future punishment be colossal billion with prison not only chronically overcrowded but unsafe as highlight by the recent prison inspectorate urgent notification about wandsworth and other prison and with violent crime on the rise enough be enough joint enterprise be costly and ineffective it be time for change in the law if the social cost of joint enterprise be not conclusive the economic cost must be the final nail in the coffin for this shocking miscarriage of justice it have be decade since evidence be first present to parliament yet our prison be dangerously overflowing and fail to rehabilitate the taxpayer be still foot the bill for thousand of people have be wrongly jail for the crime of another if someone do not make significant contribution to crime they should not be prosecute for it it be as simple as that joint enterprise be stain on our justice system and the law must be review and change to stop this dragnet it be possible to both uphold justice for the victim of crime and put an end to this injustice my simple change to the law would do just that hope that member will recognise the need for urgent change and support my new clause rise to speak to my new clause which would address the disparity between exist protect characteristic and current hate crime legislation hate crime relate to race and religion carry high maximum penalty than those associate with sexual orientation transgender or perceive transgender identity and disability that have establish an unjust dual tier justice system my proposal align with the prior expansion of aggravate offence such as the inclusion of religiously aggravate offence in follow the crime and disorder act which initially legislate only for racially aggravate offence it also build on the law commission report which emphasise the necessity of parity of protection across all protect characteristic and have garner substantial support from disability and organisation many people have ask whether this be some sort of woke frontier we know that lot of pearl clutch happen in this place when we mention trans people reassure the house and those concerned about such thing that this be no woke crusade indeed do not intend in the new clause to divert from exist legal definition of identity nor do seek to redefine the barrier of aggravate offence the new clause would simply close loophole that the law commission identify whereby some protect characteristic be treat differently from other in the legal system for no good reason that can see we have debate many time why sex gender be not include however the law commission recommend this be accept by the government in their response that they should not be because in some case it would lead to situation where the offence would be hard to prove the law commission therefore suggest that we go down different route in legislate for offence against woman and girl which the government accept the government have not yet respond to the law commission report on these issue when the bill be in committee the government ask for additional time to do so and do not accept an almost identical new clause in fact it may have be identical let set out some background and show why the time have come for we to close this loophole and why hope that the government will agree to do so my new clause come against backdrop of escalate hate crime rate which underscore the urgency to act between and incident across all monitor strand of hate crime have surge dramatically notably racially aggravate offence have more than double exceed case in similarly hate crime base on religion sexual orientation and transgender identity have see staggering increase of and respectively furthermore violent hate incident have surge comprise grow proportion of overall hate crime statistic against that backdrop believe the time have come for we to ensure that all protect characteristic be treat equally in law and my new clause seek to do just that if the government be not minded to accept the wording have propose would be very interested to have conversation with ministers in the lead up to the lords consideration of the bill if commitment be make from the dispatch box that government amendment will be table in the lords in lieu of mine will be happy to back away if not will press my new clause today it be imperative that all people regardless of their disability status their sexual orientation or their gender identity feel secure and protect from fear and violence can see no justification in law for treat those protect characteristic differently by treat they all as an aggravating factor we can ensure equitable treatment under the law for those who be victim hope that the government will either support new clause to advance this critical objective or be willing to table their own amendment in the lords in lieu of mine hon member may be shock to learn that some form of pimping be still legal in this country one of the most significant example be pimp website which be dedicate to advertising people for prostitution they function like online brothel make it as easy to order woman to sexually exploit as it be to order takeaway despite it be an offence to place prostitution advert on land for example in phone box our law have fail to keep up with technology mean that those same advert can be place legally for fee on pimp website that represent win for the website owner some of whom be generate million of pound in profit every year and for sex trafficker who can easily and quickly advertise people for prostitution and connect with wide customer base across the uk but certainly not for the victim the people who have be advertise and sell for sex and who have no legal protection from their perpetrator as member of the home affairs committee have hear harrowing evidence on the danger of these site shockingly one pimp website admit to the committee that it allow single individual to advertise multiple woman for prostitution at the same time on its site as well as allow the same contact number to be use across multiple different advert those be both red flag for sex trafficking the committee also hear of traffic gang that spend advertising group of young romanian woman rather than alert the authority the website owner allocate they an account manager to help they to spend more money show total disregard for the woman welfare it be quite clear that these pimp website be now key component of the business model for sex trafficking and they must be stop the provision in the online safety act do not close the legislative gap that allow online pimping that be why the home affairs committee recommend new offence of enable or profit from the prostitution of other which have table as new clause new clause would make it illegal to advertise another person for prostitution regardless of whether it take place online or offline be delighted to have cross party support for the new clause include from the chair of the select committee my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on commercial sexual exploitation the hon member for inverclyde ronnie cowan the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith and my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion it be an absolute scandal that pimp website be allow to operate in plain sight urge the government to support my new clause new clause be also design to combat human trafficking the definition of human trafficking in the modern slavery act be out of line with the internationally agree definition and trafficker be benefit from that the united nations protocol on trafficking the palermo protocol do not require victim to have be physically transport from one place to another for an activity to be recognise as trafficking but our modern slavery act do essentially that mean that an exploiter who force woman into prostitution advertise she on pimp website control how many man she have to have sex with each day and take her money from she could get substantially low penalty simply by virtue of not physically have transport she the maximum penalty for control prostitution for gain be seven year imprisonment for trafficking it be life it be vital that we send message to all trafficker that there be no get out clause for that offence and that we say if you trade in human being if you profit from woman be rap and abuse the absence of car journey or flight should not exempt you from punishment new clause would bring the uk definition of human trafficking in line with international standard and remove the opportunity for perpetrator of such crime to play the system that too be recommendation of the home affairs committee again urge the government to support the new clause restrict my interest today to new clause which table it would set up the offence of child criminal exploitation in other word it be fagin law the essence of the name fagin explain the new clause in simple term if an individual whether an adult or child approach child with the intention of persuade that child to engage in criminal activity that in itself would be crime that would apply whether or not the child ultimately engage in the criminal act be delighted to see the minister for crime policing and fire on the front bench because blame he for my deal with this we discuss it in meeting and put it to he that we really ought to adapt the grooming legislation or bring forward new legislation to deal with the criminal exploitation of child like normal minister he say can you go away and sort it out and come up with something for which have do he might now refuse it this evening but hope that he do not because will keep on come back the most obvious crime to target be county line organise shoplifting independent shoplifting pickpockete carry good from pickpockete carry weapon or the proceed of crime on behalf of another usually an adult who have groom the child prostitution and sex activity of which there have be quite some mention as there always be and finally and horrifically the grooming of child for terrorist purpose they wrap the child in bomb send they off to wherever they need to go and press the button absolutely horrific have have considerable discussion with few very senior very knowledgeable police officer they be unlike what the minister may feel very enthusiastic about this tiny bit of legislation go through one of the senior officer who target county line explain to that they rely mostly on try to fit the modern slavery act to that particular problem but it be poor fit it have be point out to that this approach have already be cover in section of the serious crime act in answer to recent parliamentary question of mine be inform that section be use time in and time in which be pathetic those figure be far diminish when we look at they little more closely they relate to the number of offence not to the number of individual defendant and be not sure whether some or any of they involve child second even more senior police officer who have work with have special interest in child protection that be his job he have make it clear that he be enthusiastic about this move and be sure he will thank the policing minister if we nod it through today he have make the point to that while there be provision in the serious crime act which have just mention as well as in the modern slavery act the misuse of drugs act and other act that the police can try to make fit they be poor fit it do not work because that legislation be not specific to child in essence senior police officer point out to that those piece of legislation be rarely use to stop child criminalisation they also make the point that if the legislation be adapt ever so slightly to refer to child that would make difference any member present who be parent or have have care of child will know that child not all of they but most of they be persuadable one of my village bookham have petrol station on the with shop attach to it that shop be big well known and open hour late one evening the single man who be in there look after the customer notice that there be single person in the shop an eight year old child in dressing gown she be help herself and be obviously go to zip out the door with what she have pilfer when he approach she she say if you come any close open my dressing gown and ve get nothing on underneath she would not have think of that she could not have think of it she be only eight she be quite clearly do that for somebody else who be probably sit outside with camera that be the sort of thing that we should be stop of course be go to find out in due course whether be persuade the minister as have say the opinion of that child protection officer be that the legislation we have do not fit he and many other senior police officer work in this area want further legislation to specifically equate groom through criminal exploitation with what be contain in the sexual offences act target at child protection all the officer who have an interest in the protection of child with whom have discuss this matter have point out that the key difference between my new clause and section of the serious crime act be that my new clause be specifically target at the child from my discussion with police officer have be impress by the deterrent effect on criminal who may be prosecute for child offence that understand tend to make life in jail even more difficult than it might otherwise be as number of senior lawyer include member of this house have point out to there be overlap and duplication within british law be no lawyer but many lawyer have say that to if my new clause become law the tariff apply to the crime would be that which would apply to the crime that the culprit be attempt to persuade the child to commit if it be murder the tariff would be life if it be just pilfer from shop it would be very much less as many member will be aware for many year have be push for improvement in legislation for the protection of child have also work particularly as councillor in the inner city so know they be vulnerable if my new clause be accept it would make huge change to the protection of child against life of crime there have be some excellent speech on this first day on report on the criminal justice bill and support many of the amendment that have be speak to in my remark particularly want to focus on amendment table by hon and right hon member that the home affairs committee have recommend in number of our inquiry will start with new clause on pimp website which seek to establish an offence of enable or profit from prostitution it be table by my hon friend the member for swansea east carolyn harris and commend she for her speech and for set out so clearly why this be important the home affairs committee have recommend this change and we conclude that it be imperative that the government make it criminal offence to enable or profit from the prostitution of another person to reduce and deter traffic for sexual exploitation during our inquiry on human trafficking we be shocked to find out that not only do pimp website use by trafficker enjoy impunity hope the minister for crime policing and fire be listen to this particular point because this be about his official but home office official and the national crime agency collaborate with these pimp website they sit in meet room with the operator of these website and encourage they to only provide service which minimise the likelihood of illegal or high harm activity yet the national crime agency when we question it about this approach be not able to offer any evidence that this approach to these site have lead to any reduction in trafficking or have help the safeguarding of victim the committee be therefore force to conclude that collaboration have be resounding failure what our inquiry lay bare be that website advertising prostitution be significant facilitator of traffic for sexual exploitation and the online safety act be not go to solve the problem the online safety act do not outlaw pimp website in fact disturbingly draft guidance publish by ofcom would actually provide defence for pimp website to ignore warning sign of sex trafficking quite helpfully have just be to meeting with ofcom to challenge it on this draft guidance and be not impress by the answer it give about what it would expect from website provider in carry out risk assessment the home affairs committee have be quite clear that if one man be advertise or woman on pimp website use one telephone number to we it be red flag that exploitation and most likely trafficking be go on yet we be tell by ofcom this afternoon that it do not necessarily mean that because perhaps out of the goodness of his heart the man might be help woman who choose to advertise sex by allow they to do so on his website so it would be wrong for ofcom or the website operator to infer that trafficking and exploitation be could be happen hope ofcom will read this debate and listen to the criticism of the draft guidance that it have produce so far the home affairs committee hear from witness about website advertise prostitution and we take the view that these website be market expand force as my hon friend the member for swansea east say they centralise and concentrate the customer base for trafficker man who pay for sex basically and as consequence they be magnet for trafficker even if the site be not flagrantly ignore the sign of sex trafficking which they be at the moment and may well be able to do under the new guidance from ofcom and the committee do not believe there be any way to make those site safe it be very easy for trafficker to cover their track on such site for instance by simply make their victim upload their own advert to the website that be why the home affairs committee back the change in new clause which hope the minister will look at again also support new clause table by my hon friend the member for swansea east which concern the definition of human trafficking it would bring the statutory definition of human trafficking in line with the internationally agree definition of trafficking first by remove the requirement for the exploitation to have involve travel and secondly by clarify that the consent of the victim be irrelevant in relation not just to the travel but to the exploitation itself that legislative change be recommend by the home affairs committee as result of our inquiry into human trafficking we conclude that it be vital to remove the requirement of travel and clarify that consent to exploitation be irrelevant to whether crime have be commit in order to strengthen law enforcement ability to bring the full force of the law against perpetrator of exploitation it be simply too easy for sex trafficker to operate in this country right now as my hon friend set out in her speech and ask the minister to look at what the new clause would achieve amendment to on spike be table by the hon member for gloucester richard graham and pay tribute to he for his dog determination to ensure that the government get this right one thing have learn in this place over the year have be here be that we must persist until we get the outcome that we want two year ago the home affairs committee publish the result of our inquiry into the crime of spike we find that spiking can have deeply damaging impact on the victim physical and mental health and that urgent action be need to improve the reporting investigation and prosecution of incident as well as to support victim crucially the committee determine that the absence of specific offence of spike in addition to limited reporting and investigation mean that there be few deterrent for offender we conclude that introduce specific criminal offence would act as deterrent by send clear message to perpetrator that spike be serious crime that attract severe penalty it would also facilitate police work to identify perpetrator and pattern of offend by enable the police to collect well datum on the prevalence of spike incident as well as encourage victim to report spike to law enforcement the amendment would tighten up the new clause in the bill that relate to spiking ensure that they cover attempt spiking and spiking perpetrate to humiliate to annoy or for entertainment be pleased to add my support to the hon gentleman amendment and the government would be well advise to accept they so that we can finally have robust law on spike that deter offender and ensure accountability also wish to mention government new clause the home affairs committee be currently conduct an inquiry into non contact sexual offence which encompass range of sexual offence involve no physical contact between the perpetrator and the victim such as voyeurism and indecent exposure there be significant concern that that form of violence against woman and girl be not take seriously enough with perpetrator too rarely hold to account be pleased that the government be take some action relate to non contact sexual offence and government new clause create an offence of create purport sexual image of an adult without consult the home affairs committee be develop range of recommendation to strengthen action against non contact sexual offending more broadly and look forward to share those with the minister and government in due course support the amendment table by my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips on new clause congratulate the hon member for bishop auckland dehenna davison on her campaign over many year on that important issue also support the chair of the women and equalities committee on the amendment that she have table there be so many thing in this important bill on which it would be great pleasure to talk but you will be relieve to hear madam deputy speaker that wish to focus my remark on the amendment in my name early this morning meet two of my constituent and two people who live about mile outside my constituency pay particular tribute to hilary and henry stinchcombe hilary daughter and her daughter be murder by hilary daughter husband some year ago on the edge of gloucester what that family have be through as they say today remind they and everyone here of how incredibly important it be that criminal justice bills address some of the most horrific crime that anyone can go through be grateful for the government have do so much work on this issue be particularly grateful speak primarily to amendment to in my name for have have so much help from so many colleague whether they be the member who have sign the amendment or the member who have speak in two debate and accompany in two ten minute rule bills or whether that be the terrific support give by the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson who lead home affairs committee investigation into spike and have give huge amount of moral support spike be an entirely cross bench cross party cross everything issue it be important because bit of legal history be be make it will be the first ever appearance of the word spike in draft law in the year to august which think be the late datum the national police chiefs council record just under report case of spiking divide almost equally into case by needle and drink with much small number of other report case primarily from food that be why this change matter so much anyone who do not believe that the word spike deserve to be in law be miss point that be much big than any of we realise it have be long journey as the right hon lady allude to follow she absolutely correct observation that persistence be perhaps the no thing that any of we in this house need to have if we want to achieve change in legislation she will be interested to learn that the latin word prorsum be the motto of hms gloucester take my inspiration from both the latin and english word and she be right to mention it it have be long journey than member from all part of the house might have imagine from the size and scale of the datum there have be endless meeting with home secretaries safeguard ministers justice ministers select committee member and other colleague and those have eventually lead we here it be almost three year since first become aware of the importance of the issue as so often happen to all of we it be through constituent through the experience of my constituent maisy farmer and her mother rosie what have make the difference to the atmosphere in which ministers have be able to bring this forward in legislation have no doubt that the ebullient support and anecdotal evidence from dawn dines the founder of stamp out spiking and the first hand experience from member such as my right hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes and my hon friend the member for mid sussex mims davies have make difference another factor be the fact that the actress who play spiked heroine in coronation street be comfortable to come and talk about the huge amount of correspondence she have from play that role there be also what other such as the journalist kate mccann have be through and be now able to talk about all these thing have have their influence today we have the word spike on the front page of the legislation and that be above all because the home secretary and the justice secretary get it in fact they get it some time back because the safeguard minister my hon friend the member for newbury laura farris have research and do the detail we be able to look at the specific of the legislation be propose effectively the bill update section to of the offences against the person act with clear modern post sherlock holmes language by the way imply no disparagement of the great man or his casework success but that be exactly what call for in our january debate because language matter behavioural change be valuable side effect of legislation and police record do need to show that spiking be the cause of both the primary and sometimes secondary offence the former police drug lead jason harwin specifically say that we need spike offence in law because that would help to identify the picture more quickly can the minister not the safeguarding minister but the minister for crime policing and fire who be on the bench if he can tune in briefly confirm that the offence cover by these change will be know as spike will come under that umbrella word of spike and will be record by the police as such in their datum so that we can for the first time really get an accurate sense of how many case of spike there be both primary and secondary can the minister also confirm that the bill will apply equally to both gender and transgender can he respond to my concern that the draft legislation may not necessarily cover the point make by the association of police and crime commissioners that the creation of separate criminal offence for spike would send clear message to perpetrator and victim if it be not to be separate offence can he confirm that that message will be absolutely clear as well as the method through which it will be relay can he also confirm therefore that the analysis of the datum and incidence will specifically be about spike and name as such that should encourage more victim to come forward there be also the question of motive the bill understandably focus on harmful substance which be indeed what most spike case involve but not all as we know motivation for spike vary some element of spike be clearly about create fear and cause humiliation without actually have harmful substance but that do have harmful impact we therefore need to be able to ensure that harmless as well as harmful substance be cover even though they will waste lot of potential investigation time we need to ensure that everyone be clear that so call harmless substance that be intend to humiliate the victim be not acceptable and will be punish in law my amendment be design to fill the potential gap by replace language about definitive administer attempt or attempt with an intent to injure an intent to aggrieve and an attempt to humiliate make sure that whether the action actually take place or be prevent stop or decide not to be launch the attempt be cover in law hope that the minister will give the reassurance that the safeguarding minister imply early from the dispatch box in answer to question that the criminal attempts act very much cover the attempt to spike as well as the actual spiking amendment would add to clause the word to annoy or humiliate the other person or for the purpose of the entertainment of the person or any other person that would cover the non harmful substance issue in other word the act of spike as lark for fun or just for amusement it be not at all funny for the victim involve those be the main point that want to highlight to summarise all of these amendment seek the same three simple objective first to ensure that this section of the amend act will be know to the police for their record keeping as spike offence secondly to ensure that attempt to spike even if frustrate be cover by the bill and its propose tariff of punishment and thirdly that attempt to injure humiliate and be amuse by non harmless non harmful substance spiking be cover these be probe amendment if the minister who be in his place or the safeguarding minister be able to give absolute assurance that these aspect be all cover quote as far as possible from relevant legislation will consider not push my amendment to vote believe that all colleague who have support include the chair of the home affairs committee the right hon member for kingston upon hull north would accept that situation ultimately this be about try to ensure that everyone be clear that spiking be explicitly in the law as criminal offence whether the substance be harmful whether the spiking be successful and whether it be joke or intend to be joke it be an offence that cause mental distress as much as physical harm if the minister can convince on those point we will have the tool to get to grip with spike and to support parent the nightlife scene the police the nhs university student and wide society that would be fantastic legacy of this parliament in line with the prime minister commitment to reduce violence against woman and girl who predominantly be the victim of spiking and the unstinting work of the home secretary the justice secretary and the safeguarding minister to support we to get spike into law my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips say that it be uncertain whether this legislation would ever reach the statute book because of the time available to we in the run up to the general election hope that some of the measure to be deal with on day of consideration of the bill do not get on to the statute book however across the house today there have be an interesting setting of the agenda for the next stage of the debate on the bill in the lords and perhaps for the period after the general election perhaps an incoming labour government will have to deal with those issue as well they reflect number of concern that we deal with as constituency mp congratulate the hon member for gloucester richard graham on table his amendment on spike it be an issue that affect many of our constituent hope that the government will respond positively and work through the detail perhaps we can have something in the lords that overcome some of the government concern about it agree that use the expression spike be important so that people know that we be deal with it welcome the amendment table by the hon member for gloucester richard graham it be important to indicate that my hon friend the member for bradford south judith cummins be also involve in support amendment on this matter welcome the cross party agreement on this issue the bill committee itself also work hard to try to reach consensus on some of the issue the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith be not in his place but cuckooing have become critical issue in some of our constituency where the most vulnerable people have their accommodation take over by drug dealer and feel intimidate often they be the most vulnerable with special educational need or mental health problem it be relatively new issue that have come to light in some of our constituency and it need to be address on the amendment table by my hon friend the member for bootle peter dowd in dignified way he do not go into the detail of individual incident but there have be case in my constituency we have three youngster one age and two aged kill by hit and run driver the drunk driver be eventually catch the issue be not just that they break the law but that they do not stick around to help in any way or even report the incident so that emergency vehicle could get there more quickly to assist those who have be harm the two issue want to draw attention to be the one whose campaign have be involve in first my hon friend the member for liverpool riverside kim johnson table new clause on joint enterprise think we be all get long in the tooth on this one we have be campaign for year for decade for some clarity in the law so that it do not operate as dragnet that draw people in in some instance we have have case where the individual draw in be not at the scene of the crime or be distant from the scene of the crime yet they have be prosecute for serious crime often murder for that reason the significant contribution of new clause reflect discussion and debate within legal circle but also in the court themselves it be simple amendment that would bring some justice to many case where people have unfortunately experience what believe be miscarriage of justice secondly the hon member for carshalton and wallington elliot colburn who be not in his place at the moment raise the more effective use of the law to tackle hate crime convene meeting of disability group few week ago there be wave of hate crime against disabled people at the moment on scale that we have not see for number of year we have have incident not just of abuse in the street but even people be pull out of their wheelchairs do not want to be party political here but have to say that statement by some individual ministers about lifestyle choice and benefit and so on have not help in fact it have direct some hate crime towards people with disability we need to recognise that that happen we should not sweep it under the carpet so we should have an effective legal response to it new clause table by the hon member be an effective way of ensure the message go out there to people that hate crime be serious offence and that if they commit it they will be prosecute and the sanction will be effective and serious hope that the government will accede to new clause but if he do put it to vote shall certainly be vote for it want to raise another issue prison overseas that just find preposterous to be frank the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill the chair of the justice committee refer to it and agree with he tend to think it be stunt do not see it as practical way of deal with the overcrowding problem in our prison we should deal with they in exactly the way the justice committee have be say for number of year send few people to prison in particular those for whom prison be inappropriate those with mental health problem drug problem and so on if we do send people to prison build appropriate prison so that we can maintain they but more important rehabilitate they this fly in the face of all we know about rehabilitation and everything we have learn over the year declare an interest as an honorary life member of the prison officers association everything we know from the professional involve probation officer prison officer and other work within the system be that to rehabilitate people one of the good thing we can do be first make sure they have access to their family it be their family who urge they to behave rehabilitate and come out as quickly as possible secondly we can ensure they have full access to training and education to rehabilitate thirdly we can ensure that they have proper legal advice so they know the situation they be in and come to term with it and understand the law as it apply to they my fear be that if we depend on prison in foreign country access to family will be limit that be inevitable there be no assurance that can see that prisoner would receive appropriate training or rehabilitation access to legal advice within the uk system would inevitably be restrict this therefore fly in the face of everything we know about how prison should work and it fly in the face of many of the thing that the government themselves say about how the system should operate to maintain safety but at the same time rehabilitation number of amendment and new clause have be table on the basis of professional advice from other urge the government to accept that we should not send abroad prisoner who within limited period will face potential release also think that prisoner who have be imprison for public protection should not be doubly harm by be send abroad and that proper consideration should be give to inspection arrangement believe that it will be almost impossible to maintain an appropriate inspection arrangement for both prison and escort service when they be locate abroad and that if it be maintain it will be extremely expensive this be not worth the stunt that it be it be short term measure and think that ministers will have egg on their face at the end of the day at least the amendment and new clause could ensure that there be proper inspection and regular report to parliament on how the system be operate although wish that the government be not go ahead with it as have say do not think the bill will reach the statute book but there be range of issue that we can on cross party basis take forward into whatever legislation be forthcoming there be great many amendment and new clause that will not mention because other have do so more effectively but they have set very good agenda for discussion about criminal justice in the future although do not think the second day of debate will be as constructive as today have be because some of those proposal would have an impact on our civil liberty and human right and therefore can not be support the speech from the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell have serve to demonstrate the extraordinary breadth of the bill have sit hear this afternoon about the incredible work do by my colleague on both side of the house on an immense range of issue and think that that must underline to our constituent how hard many member work on very very difficult matter the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson have call on we to be persistent she will think that be very persistent member of parliament when it come to the issue of intimate image abuse which have be talk about for nigh on decade she be right we have to be persistent because it pay off want to touch briefly on some of the amendment and new clause that have be discuss today before turn to new clause let first reiterate my support for new clause table by the mother of the house the right hon and learn member for camberwell and peckham ms harman which deal with the question of parental responsibility after rape it be an important new clause and hope that minister have listen closely to what have be say let also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for burton kate kniveton who have speak out movingly on this issue the amendment on spike table by my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham be testament to persistence and he deserve all our gratitude not only for the work he have do in get his proposal to this stage but for keep we all so well informed about the work that he be still do amendment table by my right hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes the chair of the select committee have pick up some of the issue that shall be talk about namely the way in which we treat non consensual sexual image the government need to do more work on this must try hard be my suggestion my right hon friend the member for tunbridge wells greg clark whose name be attach to new clause make an extremely moving speech about his proposal for legislation to deal with that most appalling of crime the sexual abuse of people who have die and be in the safety of mortuary new clause and be table by my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford and hope that ministers listen carefully to the compelling case that she make about the rapidity with which the online world be move and the need for we to keep the law up to date let now turn to new clause be pleased that the government table it although they know that this matter need to be address follow the passage of the online safety act the new clause show that they continue to understand the importance of classify the making of intimate image without the permission of the person in the picture as sex crime yet again however we be try to tackle it as though it be more about why the picture be take rather than about the fact that they be take in the first place that be the wrong approach and it be as wrong now as it be when we debate this issue in the online safety bill think that we have deal with that argument but clearly we have not it be out of scope of the online safety bill to make the making and taking of an intimate image without consent crime so really welcome the fact that the issue be be deal with now the online safety bill tackle the distribution of those image but we argue successfully during the passage of that bill that when it come to sexual offence new clause create sexual offence our law need first and foremost to be about consent it must be about whether there be consent or not not about whether the perpetrator intend to cause distress or alarm despite the response to my intervention early it remain unclear to why new clause be not construct in the same way as the provision in the online safety act give that it will work hand in hand with they so what be we talk about we be talk particularly about whether it should be crime for somebody to take or make an intimate sexual image of another person without their consent at the moment the bill say that it will be crime only if the crown prosecution service can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the person take or make the picture have the intention to cause the victim alarm distress or humiliation mention be make early of online rape and that be the terminology that many of the victim use the victim have speak to be still victim of that crime whether or not the perpetrator have the intention to cause they alarm distress or humiliation even more concern be the fact that the government already know from evidence that many of the people who create these image do so not to do harm cause distress or alarm their victim they do it for money oddly they sometimes do it for fun they do it for their mate they do it because they have collection of similar picture all those people who have have nude image create or take be no long victim if good lawyer can prove that the person take the image have no intention to cause alarm distress or humiliation that have to be wrong and call on the minister for crime policing and fire my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp who be sit on the front bench and the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend the member for newbury laura farris to think again they have not get this right the harm lie in create the sexually explicit image without consent the bill set out that that be not the way the law will treat this and that someone will have to prove an intention there need to be motive of the perpetrator prove sexual gratification as all the lawyer in this room know be not one of they that be incredibly difficult consent base approach would focus on the core wrong of non consensual sexual conduct motif be not require in most sexual offence mention be make early about the way in which some organisation have remove nudification app from their website be concerned that they might work out that if they state that their motive be just to make money they would not be break the law if they allow those nudification app to continue to be available be also concern as to whether the government have talk to ofcom the regulator about how it will be able to limit the appearance of these image give the way in which the law be currently frame so there be two question from will the minister urgently reconsider new clause and bring it into line with the online safety act have simple idea for she which be to amend the amendment so that it be consistent with the online safety act in have base offence that include production of sexual image which can include the taking or creating of an image or the government could amend their propose creation offence to make it consent base not intention base the former think be straightforward secondly welcome the fact that some company be take pre emptive action to remove their nudification app which call for in the international women day debate but they will quickly see that this incredible loophole mean that so long as they have the right legal defence such nudification app be entirely within the law will the minister tell the house how the government be go to make these nudification app unlawful and get rid of they once and for all as people across the nation want thank professor clare mcglynn again for assist in interpret the intention of government amendment it be publish on thursday so apologise to the house for not be able to give more detailed analysis have have it for only the past three day hope that at some stage ministers will be in position to explain their thinking and hope change their mind know the safeguarding minister my hon friend the member for newbury have put in writing that she want to send crystal clear message that make intimate image material be immoral and crime she need to try hard to make sure the bill do just that rise to make short speech in support of new clause in the name of the hon member for bishop auckland dehenna davison thank she for her kind word about my friend and constituent maxine and tony maxine thompson curl lose her son kristian david thompson in he be just year old and his life be take by one punch one punch can and do kill to lose love one at young age in such senseless way when they be simply on night out be pain that can not imagine since kristian pass maxine have devote her life to raise awareness support other and campaign for strong sentencing she have do this via her charity one punch uk which she run with her husband anthony curl use her pain love and grief maxine have always be relentless in educate people to stop think and walk away instead of use their fist although it be generally accept that there be concern rise in one punch attack across the uk there be no official figure on the life lose and devastate by single punch what we do know be that almost every time precious life be take in this way it be report that the perpetrator be intoxicate and their sentence for take the life of another be almost always extremely lenient the average sentence be four year and some walk away after just four month in prison that be four month for take somebody else life justice be an important cornerstone of our legal system although nothing at all can bring back love one for many people an important part of be able to grieve be know that there be consequence for the person who take their love one away from they new clause would put an end to lenient sentence and would hopefully act as deterrent so that people think and walk away before use their fist it would also mean that we have reliable datum on the prevalence of one punch attack in the first four year after similar legislation be pass in australia the number of one punch death halve one australian attorney general have report massive reduction in violence since the legislation be introduce more than five year ago the then minister say that he be happy to look at my proposal in relation to one punch sentencing and be pleased that the government have look at this new clause and agree with the hon member for bishop auckland but my constituent remain of the view that strong sentencing be need it be indeed what they have campaign on for many year with that in mind carefully consider the minister response to the new clause in committee and be not fully convinced of her argument she state that one punch attack be already cover under manslaughter but there be no mandatory minimum sentence for manslaughter and therefore no minimum sentence for one punch attack that be why we ask for that in the new clause she state that the government wish to avoid anomaly in the law and give the example of someone be kill by punch to their abdomen she will know as will other hon member that single punch to the head be likely to be more catastrophic than single punch to the abdomen as it can cause fatal damage to the brain it can stop breathe starve the brain of oxygen and cause the victim to collapse and strike their head on hard surface the minister also state that the government wish to avoid another anomaly in case where someone be kill by two or more punch as oppose to one surely those case would be view as involve intent to cause serious harm whereas one punch could sometimes be view as mistake and thus result in more lenient sentence as we so often see sincerely hope that she can address those concern in her closing comment maxine tell this week that she know full well that the new clause may not be accept by the government today but she be thankful for any awareness and to have the issue raise again on the floor of the house because she know the life shatter damage that one punch can cause before end pay tribute again to the hon member for bishop auckland be sure that she will be in her place again very soon for her bravery and determination in push the government to do the right thing for those who be no long with we and for those leave grieve for they as the minister say in her opening comment be sure that the hon lady dad be look on with pride call the chair of the justice committee this have be wide range debate because it be wide range bill and it have touch on number of difficult sometimes sensitive and complex topic however the tone of the debate do the house great deal of credit appreciate the tone and approach take by both front bench team there be more common ground than not on number of these area let we see what we can do to improve thing particularly appreciate the approach adopt by our minister today whose engagement have be exceptional on all these matter be grateful to she let deal with some of the amendment certainly congratulate my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on his work on cuckooing which be real issue have see it in my constituency we have gap in the law that we need to plug also endorse what be say by my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller about new clause and related matter the concept of consent be perfectly well establish in the law on sexual offence and there would be nothing abnormal in make consent rather than motive the gravaman of the offence in question in fact that approach would bring they more into line with the rest of the canon of sexual offence really hope that the government will think hard about that obviously take on board the point make about the amendment that my right hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes speak to and the powerful speech make by my right hon friend the member for tunbridge wells greg clark about the desecration of corps that be vile concept and clearly the law need to be amend will concentrate on two matter that the justice committee have examine over period the first be the provision on the transfer of prisoner to serve sentence in prison overseas make it clear that be sceptical about the efficacy of that measure do not say it be unlawful and do not think the opposition be say that either accept that it have happen in limited circumstance elsewhere include in state that be party to the european convention on human right the most obvious example be belgium rent prison space in the netherlands but there have also be an example in norway and scandinavia however our situation be very different those two instance highlight the limited value of such arrangement the prison space that belgium rent in holland be very close by in some case it be literally up the road and there be similar situation in the scandinavian country in addition those country be in the schengen area those instance be not the same as transfer people overseas some distance away the practical implication which the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and other refer to will get in the way of the proposal achieve anything be grateful to the minister for recognise some of the concern raise by opposition front benchers and the law society it be imperative that proper legal advice be available it be important that there be an inspection regime that ensure parity of standard with those in united kingdom prison again stress the importance of maintain family tie the minister follow these thing very closely so she will know that the evidence overwhelmingly show time and again that the three good thing for get people to turn their life around and not reoffend be roof over their head home and family or relationship if family relationship or close family tie of any kind be undermine it make it more likely that people will reoffend give the number of safeguard that will have to be put in place to safeguard not just convention right to which the minister rightly refer but common law right which predate the convention and our incorporation of it into our domestic law through the human rights act it be highly unlikely that anyone will ever end up go abroad would much rather we concentrate on more direct measure to deal with the crisis of overcrowding in our prison the overseas jail cell measure will not make any difference to the pressure on prison place or any contribution to long term demand if we want to return foreign national prisoner abroad it would be much well to speed up our prisoner return agreement and get those prisoner to serve their sentence in their home country that would be constructive we already have the measure and the legal framework to do that we just need to be much more rigorous in our use of they if we really want to deal with overcrowding in our prison the government and the business manager need to get grip and bring the sentencing bill back to the floor of the house that bill contain valuable sensible and balanced measure that deal with public protection properly it provide far well suite of measure to reduce unproductive form of imprisonment and concentrate the very expensive resource of prison where it be most need on violent dangerous and serious offender that would be far great contribution pay massive tribute to my hon friend the member for bishop auckland dehenna davison for her work in this area as lawyer during my time at the criminal bar have both prosecute and defend one punch manslaughter case fully understand the impact on family have sometimes have to talk to family who have have to accept manslaughter charge with great respect to my hon friend do not think the wording of her new clause as it stand would meet what be require to deal with this be concerned that we be look at the offence in piecemeal fashion unlawful act manslaughter be legally complex area it be often not easy for jury to understand it be not even easy for judge look at the factual situation to direct on that be highlight recently in the court of appeal decision in the case of auriol grey the severely autistic and disabled lady whose action tragically cause an elderly cyclist to fall off her bicycle into the path of car and be kill she be originally convict on the basis of unlawful act manslaughter very strong court of appeal quash that conviction which highlight some of difficulty in such case be interested in the comment of the hon and learn member as the bill go to the house of lords will he work with and other who be concerned about one punch attack to draft something that he think would do what it be suppose to and be more legally sound be always happy to talk about it it be my conviction that single piece of legislation purely on one punch manslaughter be not the answer if there be to be legislation it should be wholesale reform of the law of homicide the law commission recommend reform of the law of homicide as long ago as but that be not act on that would deal with not just the issue of unlawful act manslaughter but the other form of manslaughter include gross negligence manslaughter reckless manslaughter and the interplay between murder and manslaughter manslaughter be often an alternative verdict then of course we have the special defence in relation to diminish responsibility which reduce under certain circumstance murder down to manslaughter that be slightly complicated field the law be difficult for jury to follow and we oftentime use law that go back to almost the and century as for the right way forward we should do two thing first all the work be do around the information campaign include one punch awareness and the walk away message take exactly the right approach secondly we should look again cross party at wholesale reform of the law of homicide which could pick up those issue joint enterprise remain problem pay tribute to the hon member for liverpool riverside kim johnson for the work that she have do and for her amendment be not convince that its wording be right but we have to return to this matter for the very important reason that many family of those who have be convict under joint enterprise have hop that the supreme court decision in the case of jogee which reverse what it describe as the wrong turn take in the case of chan wing siu in would see number of people conviction quash in reality subsequent decision of the court of appeal have tend to narrow the approach in jogee very often because of the factual situation which vary greatly we do therefore need to look at this issue be not sure that the wording in the amendment be the answer but hope that we can work constructively on that there be certain circumstance in which there be role for joint enterprise but the expansion of it beyond what most people regard as reasonable be matter of real concern hope we can continue to work cross party to find well solution concern that the government have raise previously when joint enterprise have be consider be the use of the word significant and the term significant contribution the government have argue that that be too vague do my hon and learn friend agree that significant be commonly use in criminal justice and that judge and magistrate be very experienced in advise jury or lawyer on decide what significant mean the government need to come up with something little more compelling than the suggestion that significant be not meaningful word entirely agree with my hon friend significant be good starting point for the work that we need to do the intellectually rather convoluted approach that we have to joint enterprise at the moment be really not tenable jury will understand significant if we be to have an indictable offence we need test that jury will readily comprehend significant be comprehensible to juror in light of today debate and the discussion that we have over several week in committee do the hon and learn gentleman agree that there be lacuna in legislation in whole range of area think he be suggest that we need cross party approach but time be run out do he think that certain thing could be push through but not in rushed fashion they would be consider carefully in the chamber agree with the hon gentleman sentiment many of these matter will require consideration and on the homicide angle the involvement hope of the law commission it could be ask to revisit its report of in fact hope that will be do whatever the party in government the same be true in relation to sentencing for one punch manslaughter be cautious about minimum sentence generally understand the feeling that sentencing be sometimes too low but at the moment manslaughter can encompass huge range of fact and degree of culpability any sentencer have to balance the consequence of the act against the level of culpability of the offender the huge range in culpability create difficulty with minimum sentence it would be well to ask the sentencing council to review the matter if that be do in the knowledge that there will be cross party approach it will carry more weight and give we well outcome finally will touch on the production of defendant in the dock to hear sentence pass it be sensitive issue the sense of outrage among victim and family when people refuse to come up into the dock be perfectly understandable it be cock snook at the system and at the suffering and grief of the victim and family but there be practical issue that we have to bear in mind the government ought to look at some of the safeguard that have be propose particularly give our duty of care to prison staff pay tribute to our prison staff who take risk every day in prison it be even hard in the hold cell of court and the passageway up to the court and into the dock anyone who have be in dock as some of we have many time professionally will know that they be tight space it be not easy staff do not have the same defensive and protective arrangement that they would have in prison if those staff be contractor who may not do it on regular basis there be real risk we do not want those people to come to harm we must also ensure that ultimate discretion as to what be appropriate always lie with the judge because the last thing we want for victim family be for psychopathic or extremely aggressive defendant to try to hijack the sentencing proceeding and use their presence in court to turn up the bile anger rage or in some case that we have see political posturing for example in terrorist case it be terribly important that the judge have the ultimate say in all these matter hope that have encompass most of the issue raise there be other that we do not have time to touch on see that my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington elliot colburn be still present hope that the government will think about his new clause look at the law commission report it be carefully reason and moderately express and hope that the government will find the mean either in this house or in the other place for further discussion and will take his legitimate concern on board there have be good progress with the bill it be well for what it do not include in some case we will come to that on day much of what it do include have be improve but it highlight the complexity that face the criminal justice system as whole we always have to be careful not to tinker when sometimes we need more holistic approach and of course the resource to go with it which be the other key thing that we need be grateful to all those who speak in the debate and to the minister for the constructive tone that she have adopt throughout this have indeed be wide range debate we use that phrase too often in this place but it be true today and it be pleasure to bring it to close be grateful to all hon member who take part in the time available to will seek to respond on as many of the non government new clause and amendment as can and to answer question if fail please give nudge will then write to hon member or catch up with they at some point and give they response will begin with new clause pick up where leave off be address my hon friend the member for bishop auckland dehenna davison and her excellent campaign let set out the step that the government be take she allude to they in her excellent speech but will confirm what they be we have work with the national police chiefs council lead for homicide kate meynell to appoint name lead for one punch homicide that person will carry out an initial scoping exercise to properly establish how many of these case be occur and to understand whether there be barrier to investigation and prosecution for these offence take my hon friend point that we should consider how the offence be communicate to the family give the particular issue that arise in her case we will also build on action already take include the three month walk away campaign that be launch in december that dovetail very neatly with the work of one punch uk know that that be something my hon friend will be involve in we will establish low culpability manslaughter homicide service practice review lead by victim support which deliver the homicide service the review will consider case of manslaughter where there be low culpability and look forward to work with my hon friend and get start on that we will also conduct individual sentence review into particular case where there be an objection to the end of the sentence and we will look at the sentencing remark she give the name of number of campaigner in her speech and look forward to pick those up with she will comment briefly on new clause relate to joint enterprise which be raise by the hon member for liverpool riverside kim johnson by my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill the chair of the justice committee and by other the new clause would caveat and curtail the law of joint enterprise only to those who have make significant contribution the hon member for liverpool riverside know that joint enterprise be there so that those who act as the burglary lookout who provide the weapon in the murder or who drive the getaway vehicle do not escape the consequence of their crime which shatter live it be already the case follow the supreme court decision in jogee that the person must have help or encourage the commission of the offence and intend to do so have consider number of example of case where there have be conviction on this basis in recent year such as the boy who send whatsapp to his colleague to encourage she to conduct fatal attack or the year old lad who stand on the edge of woodland as lookout while his friend gang rap girl they be very painful case will simply say this think that people who participate in crime even on the periphery should not escape liability and do not think anyone can advance credible argument that they should we on the government side still think that those people ought to be lock up admit that and have not say that we should get rid of joint enterprise but we know that thousand of young people and child have be incarcerate for something they have not do the law be not be use in the way it should be as the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill mention in respect of the jogee case we take wrong turn and we have take another wrong turn we need to get it right be go to respectfully differ from the hon lady be happy to have another conversation with she about it but be afraid that even those on the periphery often have their hand all over the crime will return briefly to new clause on bladed article which be table by the shadow minister the hon member for nottingham north alex norris the issue of ninja sword be raise by the other shadow minister the hon member for stockton north alex cunningham want to provide reassurance that both straight blade ninja sword which the new clause be direct at and curved sword be cover curved sword be ban by the government in and he will know that possess sword or any knife even kitchen knife in public place without good reason be already criminal offence punishable by up to four year in prison the reason why straight sword be more difficult to ban be that some of they be hold by military historian and for commemorative purpose however want to provide reassurance to those on the shadow front bench that the policing minister engage recently with the npcc lead on knife crime who reassure he once again that the npcc be not seek ban on the use of straight bladed sword in fact of all the knife crime fatality in the last year around be cause that way what the npcc be ask for be clampdown on the online sale of knife to which we be do under the online safety act the power to seize knife in private place if the police think they will be use for criminal purpose which be already in the bill and ban on machete and zombie knife which we be bring in in september want to provide that reassurance new clause and be introduce by my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford who can not see but be sure she have just pop out she have just pop out she make an outstanding speech which illuminate and identify yet more of the nefarious way that child abuser find to conduct some of the most serious offence against child she know as be clear in her constructive speech that artificial intelligence raise unique problem agree without hesitation with the force of what she say and about the identification of an offence as she have present it recognise that it be our duty as parliamentarian to future proof our legislation and thank she for her detailed work on this issue commit to work with she and to try as good we can to get something ready for report in the other place pay tribute to my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington elliot colburn for the sensitive and thoughtful way in which he approach the law commission report and the issue of hate crime and for his new clause to introduce protect characteristic to the crime and disorder act of course have read the law commission excellent report on this matter and can confirm that response to it be always forthcoming this year want to make two slight qualification that might explain some of the delay many member will be aware that the law commission do not recommend make sex protect characteristic for hate crime and may remember that there be campaign to make misogyny hate crime which the commission reject that require careful thought because not all the protect characteristic have be treat in the same way another issue be the implementation of the hate crime legislation in scotland which have be both highly contentious and be afraid somewhat chaotic of course we wish to avoid replicate those mistake however want to provide reassurance by say that our intention be to deal with this matter subject to all the normal approval in the house of lords and hope that my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington will come and work with on it the other excellent speech that want to refer to be that of my right hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes she alight on two important issue cyber flash and intimate image abuse that be not on the priority offence list in schedule to the online safety act that be not because we do not consider they important or sinister offence she will need no persuading give everything that we have do on intimate image abuse that the opposite be true the fact be that they be not on the statute book or certainly have not be commence when we pass the act know that the secretary of state be well aware of that particularly in relation to both those issue know that my right hon friend be conduct an urgent review as we speak and be sure that in the week ahead will be able to update she on where we be on this do not want she to think for moment that we be drag our foot appreciate that my hon friend be seek to give an assurance from the dispatch box but it be perhaps not quite as fulsome as would wish she say that the priority offence register can be review it would be very helpful if we have specific timescale by which the measure could be add that would give reassurance to all victim that such image will be make illegal in their in own right and that ofcom and internet service provider will work together to take they down we already have the criminal offence so the perpetrator can go to prison but the victim want the image the repeat offence to be remove from the internet listen very carefully to what my right hon friend say and agree with every single word of it some of this sit with the department for science innovation and technology as she know so would need to have conversation with the relevant minister but feel as strongly as she do on this matter and assure she from the dispatch box that will use my good endeavour the road traffic amendment which will talk about briefly be beautifully present during the committee and again today have speak few time with the members who table they who be well aware that those matter sit with the department for transport understand that they have have engagement with the department and that an important review of this issue have certainly be contemplate apologise to my hon friend be briefly out of the chamber discuss my amendment with the home secretary it be clear that ai technology be move incredibly quickly in vile disgusting way that be put child at risk of sexual abuse could my hon friend repeat the commitment she have give that she will work with on the two area that my amendment have highlight and will work with the iwf and other to ensure that the issue we have pinpoint be address as the bill go through this house and the lords thank my right hon friend for her intervention and be sorry that we somehow do not manage to overlap when make my comment about she think her speech be outstanding and agree without hesitation she be quite right to say that we need to future proof our legislation as say think we be the first country if not we be one of the first to put an offence on to the book relate to the creation of deepfake which show that we be alive and very responsive to this issue will make the commitment that my right hon friend have request to be clear be the minister give cast iron guarantee that we will address these issue of paedophile manual and use chatbot to communicate sexually include rap child through chatbot by work with the iwf and other to ensure that the law be clear and that if necessary there will be amendment in the lords yes can give my right hon friend that commitment be interrupt but be briefly pay tribute to the very passionate speech that have be make about road traffic accident these be not small matter the case of the little girl in the constituency of the hon member for merthyr tydfil and rhymney gerald jones be such painful one and know that the transport secretary and other ministers have be very affect by it as the hon member know this matter be not straightforward for reason that we have discuss but hope progress will be make on it in way that help his constituent my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith make an excellent speech on the offence of cause death or serious injury by dangerous careless or inconsiderate cycling it be not in dispute that whether vehicle be car an electric scooter or bicycle if it be operate in certain way it be effectively dangerous weapon on the road we be supportive of my right hon friend amendment and we will be bring it back in the lords we will be change it in the lords as he know but we be accept it think have cover all the amendment that have be select assume that my hon friend mean that she will accept the amendment when move it yes do mean that the final amendment that will speak to are new clause and relate to new criminal sanction on water company everyone in this house want to ensure that our water regulator have at their disposal all the tool they need to get on top of the sewage discharge issue but as the minister sum up could she explain to the house whether ofwat already have the power be seek in the amendment table by the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron if the same power be give to the environment agency that would be more likely to lead to confusion and lack of clarity about which agency be take the lead on such prosecution which might lead to prosecution fall through the crack my right hon friend be quite correct that be the basis on which the government can not accept the amendment of course everybody agree that water company should be punish as robustly as possible but it be also the case that we have pre exist offence that apply pollution incident be already the subject of criminal sanction available to the environment agency under the environmental permitting england and wales regulations and there be serious risk of duplication not least because hope the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron will not mind my say this the sanction he have include in his amendment be just more fine and we already have fine regime let set out very briefly the basis on which in principled way we be say no to the amendment as the environment regulator the environment agency can and do prosecute company director and other senior officer under the relevant regulation it have power to fine and there can be conviction for pollute river and coastal water where it can be prove that the offence have be commit expand criminal liability would simply create repetition of the exist power it be the government view that the amendment would create dangerous and unacceptable risk of double jeopardy across the two regulatory regime that be administer by ofwat and the environment agency the amendment would simply duplicate the exist sanction as my right hon friend the member for ludlow philip dunne put it for not meet performance commitment more seriously they could undermine the robustness of the environment agency criminal sanction regime on that basis hope the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale will understand why we do not want to see duplication in an area where there be already the capacity to prosecute criminal law regime and the sanction of fine which be everything that his amendment seek fear the minister be come to the end of her remark but she have not address my new clause do she have any comment on it thank the hon lady for remind but have not forget listen carefully to her speech and have read all her amendment not all of which be select but some of which she have raise before on the general defence she will know that the law commission be currently undertake review of the defence of duress in relation to woman and the crime it be not that amendment know that the amendment have not be select but want to provide the hon lady with some reassurance on it because we on this side of the house continue to think about the issue she have raise she be aware of the law commission review of the defence of duress as it apply to murder want to provide she with an update and some reassurance that we will take the lesson that come out of that review and consider it more widely if appropriate in alignment with the point that think she make early in this debate on new clause this be an important point between we but the government be resist it not because there be any real dispute of principle but because there be dispute of degree there be concern that by amend the wording of section and of the sexual offences act as so draft we could unnecessarily narrow the scope of section as it have be apply in the criminal court and potentially add an additional element to be prove in relation to section that could make prosecution hard we disagree not on the principle but about whether it will have the effect she be look for do listen carefully to her speech and the way that she have present the argument on previous occasion the safeguarding minister will have be brief by my right hon friend the minister for crime policing and fire on the exchange across the house on the key issue of spiking which will make its first ever appearance in legislation if the bill be pass ask specific question which would be grateful if she return to although my amendment will not be pursue it would be reassure for everyone in the country if she say that the spike clause now inject will cover attempt to spike as well as prove spike and will apply to spike attempt that may not be consider harmful in substance but be incredibly harmful to the people they humiliate yes can confirm that those inchoate offence attempt offence be all capture in the act to which refer in my opening speech on whether name the offence of spiking will improve police record keeping say to my hon friend that it will absolutely do that it will remove the discrepancy between what might have be call date rape under the sexual offences act and what would have be record previously as poison act under the offences against the person act for consistency in recording we be very pleased to make the change thank the minister for give way again on that specific point she be effectively say that the datum collect by the police will now be collect under the umbrella of spiking so we will have much well datum and know how widespread the problem really be which think everyone will be reassure to hear may also thank she the home secretary and the justice secretary for their fantastic and immediate support in get this provision into the bill which very much hope will pass through this parliament before the next general election it be not just the effect of the amendment that will improve police recording one purpose of the amendment be to improve police recording and it will give hope much more accurate picture of the extent of the problem on the comment that my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller make regard the creation offence relate to deepfake image and intent will consider the point carefully would like to have further discussion on it hope the minister be listen to the chair of the justice committee who wholeheartedly agree with the point be make namely that it would be entirely consistent with the sex offence law to remove intent from that measure and simply focus on consent that be what we need to hear and hope the minister will now agree at the dispatch box that she will consider that strongly certainly give my right hon friend that reassurance look forward to continue our discussion throughout the passage of the bill question put and agree to new clause accordingly read second time and add to the bill new clause sexual activity with corpse in the sexual

outer leaseholders and freeholders motion make and question propose that this house do now webb begin by thank my constituent in portishead whose dogged determination not to be treat as supine cash cow have lead to this debate which be proud to have secure on their behalf the resident at port marine beautiful development in portishead that transform derelict industrial land into an extremely desirable place to live buy their property some leasehold and some freehold with an external property management company manage some communal part my hon friend the minister will recognise in that tale situation mirror up and down the country with uncertainty about bill and charge at one end of the spectrum and the inability to sell property that be effectively value at nothing at the other there be two key issue the variable service charge and the fixed rent charge be grateful to sebastian of the leasehold knowledge partnership who describe the situation thus it be an arrangement cook up by developer and council it mean developer have management company and income stream that they can sell on to management company such as firstport and the council save money by not adopt these open space meanwhile the often young buyer of these property end up pay council tax and the management charge while old local often live in more valuable house pay to the council only the situation be increasingly be describe as what it be namely fleecehold resident initially write to about the increase in the variable service charge to level that they believe be unreasonable attempt to gain transparency on the cost go back several year include face to face meeting between firstport and portishead resident in the issue affect around of my constituent both freeholder and leaseholder in effect resident have complain that the amount they be pay do not match the amount of land be manage by firstport or the level of work it undertake on the port marine estate it have also be difficult to get transparency from firstport when resident have request breakdown of its cost for manage their property and land on november join constituent represent the portishead management charge action group along with two representative of north somerset council and two representative of firstport for walk around the port marine estate to look at the area manage by firstport and by north somerset council respectively we find that very small area of the estate be manage by firstport for which it charge at least per annum that charge seem particularly high and produce around of income per year for firstport ideally resident would like to see the land manage by north somerset council which look after large part of the estate already naturally the council would like to receive substantial sum from firstport to transfer those duty but with no agreement forthcoming it be easy to see why my constituent find themselves in something of trap commend the right hon gentleman for rightly bring this issue to the attention of the house do he agree that although the leasehold advisory service give free advice for england and wales as it should the advice be not grant in all situation so when his constituent seek advice in many case they would be unsure about where they stand without costly legal advice and that the government and the minister must provide much more clarity across the board be grateful to the hon gentleman will go on to set out just how horrendous some of those charge be and how it can be very difficult for my constituent to get legal redress that be no doubt situation that my hon friend the minister have hear on number of occasion we all understand that communal land must be manage for the benefit of all no one dispute that but it need to be do in way that be fair and equitable predictable and transparent the current position be none of those thing the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that many of these arrangement be never make clear to people when they purchase their property and too often developer have take shortcut to create secondary income stream when actually they should be pay lump sum to the local authority to take over those responsibility it be double whammy for those who be on the end of it be it not swear there be no collusion here madam deputy speaker but the hon gentleman take very neatly on to an even more horrendous example than the one have already set out fix rent charge first let set out to the house the history by which property company can fleece freeholder use this mechanism across the country as whole rent charge be rare but they do exist in part of england such as around bath bristol and manchester real problem can arise when buyer or their conveyancing solicitor fail to spot their presence in the title deed why because rent charge which be introduce mainly in the late and early century be put in place when landowner want to sell land at reduce cost to developer they would sell the land on freehold basis but retain legal interest in the land and charge an annual fee or rent charge which be in place for ever historically the rent charge be typically between and which be quite lot in those day but have be regard as nominal in recent year while many rent charge have fall dormant other have be buy up by property company which be now ruthlessly enforce payment the rent owner be entitle to recover any sum due but do not have to send reminder to the freeholder and as understand it be legally entitle to impose penalty after day when the account inevitably fall into arrear usually by take out statutory lease on the home as security that would then make the property almost impossible to sell unless the freeholder pay thousand to redeem the lease that be outrageous let outline the issue in respect of portishead in solicitor act on behalf of crest nicholson the original landowner of the development write to firstport then know as consort advise it that the fixed rent charge should be reduce to although firstport share that information with some resident and reduce the charge accordingly it do not do that for all resident and continue to invoice some to the tune of between and per annum those resident be later refunded after try to renege on that agreement at the end of firstport inform resident in december that it again intend to start charge to per year for the fixed rent charge firstport have argue that because no deed of variation be enter into to confirm the reduction mean that the agreement to reduce the fixed rent charge be not legally binding it can effectively do what it like needless to say resident who be not advise in that they need to enter into deed of variation or log the change with the land registry be extremely unhappy recently under pressure from resident crest nicholson and myself firstport agree to keep the fixed rent charge to per annum provide that resident enter into deed of variation it be instructive to see what crest nicholson have make of this debacle on february it tell crest view be that the decision be take by firstport to unilaterally reimpose the fixed rent charge of the property at port marine be not only unfair but the underlying mechanism within the transfer be potentially open to challenge in the court this be because the annual charge they be propose to claim between and be not what court would consider to be nominal amount requirement for fix rent charge to be lawful under the rentcharges act interestingly crest also tell many of the resident wrongly believe this money be be pay in exchange for firstport perform service firstport be already able to recover its cost for enforce covenant from the variable element of the rent charge so firstport claim that this be its purpose be at good questionable follow meeting that we have at the end of march crest nicholson make it clear that it be no long hand out contract to firstport let turn to the question of the deed of variation firstport initially quote resident plus vat to enter into the deed of variation offer that price as discount rate in its letter to on march it state that its legal fee for enter into any type of deed of variation would usually be vat in other word this be bargain that my constituent should jump at in order not be force to pay year they could pay firstport as one off payment to prevent that from happen in the future think many of we would regard that as extortion this whole saga have cause constituent great deal of stress despite that they have indicate that the cost be tolerable mean they be willing but not happy to enter into the deed of variation and be do with the whole saga firstport have set deadline of june for resident to enter into the deed of variation so we have variable service charge that can be raise and enforce without any clear and transparent link with the service be undertake then we have the truly horrendous situation in which rent charge which have no relation whatsoever to any service be provide can effectively be raise and apply through the threat of make property unsellable and the only mean of escape be for resident to enter into deed of variation at price determine by guess who firstport let be clear regard this as daylight robbery and historical anomaly that have no place in our modern society be sure that firstport will not be the only property company up and down our country act in this way as the minister department introduce regulation follow the passage of the levelling up and regeneration act and as it look at leasehold reform ask my hon friend to see how quickly we can redress these wholly unacceptable position and consign they to the dustbin of history which be where they belong it be great pleasure to respond in this short debate and to talk about an issue of huge importance to so many colleague around the house over the past few month as we have talk about leasehold more and more colleague have come up to to highlight the iniquity problem and challenge that they see in their constituency be grateful to my right hon friend the member for north somerset sir liam fox for highlight the issue that he have experience and be very sorry to hear about port marine and the challenge that its resident face obviously can not comment too much on individual case but it be absolutely vital that we hear individual example have hear example from around the country of particularly egregious extortion and problem with the framework of leasehold that be one of the reason why we be bring forward leasehold reform because we recognise that there need to be change leasehold can work in some place and some element of it can be successful but as my right hon friend have outline the problem be that there be too much bad practice in the sector there be too many distortion within that tenure too many inefficiency that can be exploit and frankly too many rent seeker in the sector who be try to exploit those distortion and inefficiency know that opposition colleague also feel strongly about this issue but we conservatives be nothing if we do not seek to smash monopoly stop rent seeking make market more perfect and stand up for the little guy story such as the one that my right hon friend recount today highlight the reason why we be reform leasehold there be way to go in make that market more perfect but that be exactly what we be try to do the leasehold and freehold reform bill will bring into law many reform to well protect and empower leaseholder exist leaseholder will find it easy and cheap to extend their lease or buy their freehold reform to the cost regime for enfranchisement and right to manage claim will make they more accessible enable leaseholder to take control of their building and therefore their future the issue of rent charge also apply to freeholder it be not just leaseholder who be the victim an amendment to the rentcharges act would deal with the problem once and for all so encourage my hon friend to look at amendment to that act when we bring forward legislation on this subject if the government do not want to bring forward such an amendment to the act would be more than happy to table one my right hon friend be absolutely right there be impact on both freeholder and leaseholder different type of property and tenure be impact in different way element of the rent charge regime will be extinguish by the act which he rightly reference in that have be in law since before be report may vol correction however there be number of other issue that need addressing and the leasehold and freehold reform bill be introduce to address some of they whole range of reform be necessary across the leasehold sector and the bill seek to address that but as my right hon friend outline there be two main issue that this discussion of port marine have highlight the variable service charge and the rent charge point which he just speak about little more the bill as it stand will absolutely make progress on variable service charge in number of way it will not fix what have happen in the past but it absolutely seek to minimise the chance of it happen again unjustified increase in variable service charge be not acceptable any service charge must be transparent and communicate effectively and there should be clear route for challenge they if thing go wrong the bill ensure that all leaseholder will receive key minimum financial and non financial information regularly include standardised service charge demand form an annual report of charge the timely provision of service charge account and the right to obtain other relevant information that be significant step forward as know from discussion with both leaseholder and freeholder in my constituency and from have speak with colleague from all around the house who have similar issue we be also take measure on service charge to ensure that leaseholder be not subject to unjustified legal cost for the first time they can when appropriate claim their cost from landlord if they go through the tribunal process and win there will be significant change on variable service charge as and when the bill pass through both houses on fix rent charge the bill introduce framework to empower homeowner and to hold estate management company to account for the service they provide there will need to be transparency of information there will be new legal requirement that estate management charge must be reasonable for the first time there will be an ability to challenge excessive cost through the tribunal and to ensure that estate management company be hold to account the measure will also cover admin fee include deed of variation my right hon friend highlight that point as say there will for the first time be right to apply to the tribunal for redress if there be strong view and proof that the manage agent in charge be do something inappropriate or be not fulfil their duty people can apply to tribunal to have substitute manager appoint that will for the first time provide an opportunity for resident to highlight problem and remove people who consistently cause problem as say in committee we recognise in committee and from previous debate in the house the strength of feeling among colleague that have be show again by my right hon friend in this debate and by the contribution of other hon member we be consider far whether we can look at this area in more detail hope that can soon say more from the government front bench about that although can not do so tonight to conclude my right hon friend be absolutely right to raise the issue in this case and to highlight the key challenge that we see daily to do with when this system do not work he raise how and when this system be not work for port marine hope there be restitution and that solution come as soon as possible recognise the individual example of when thing be not work but the government be take action in very conservative way recognise that we have to deal with these monopoly smash the rent seeker and remove distortion to make market more perfect we must ensure that there will not be another port marine in or year time when the bill go through we will significantly improve this market and leasehold and significantly change rent charge so that people who want to buy their house and have the benefit of owner occupation we want to do all we can to empower people gain real control over their future we look forward to colleague support the bill as it go through its final stage in the house in the come week question put and agree to house adjourn
