community from every part of the world work and live alongside one another it be what make the area such great place to live and to represent each community that arrive add to the mix but also join in those long stand east london tradition of hard work community spirit and plain speak kamal chunchie also remind we that while much focus be place on the change that have happen since there have be diversity much long in the canning town have the large black community in london migration have be fact of east london life for century german immigration into east london in the victorian era be part of my family history the debate around those who choose to make the uk their home be frequently too narrow and too often drive by populist voice we forget our history at our peril but east london be testament to its vibrancy my constituent do not lack ambition aspiration or talent they have it in inspirational quantity but too often they lack opportunity poverty be real issue and in recent year have become much bad locally we have see child go to event in the hope of get food because they be hungry parent sleep in shift on mattress on the floor because there be not enough room for the whole family to have bed and child force to do their homework in the bathroom because there be no other space for they to do it this government be elect on mandate for change for many of my constituent that be not an aspiration it be necessity my early labour predecessor be send here to represent those who have no voice those who need to be lift out of poverty and those who deserve well life be under no illusion more than century on that demand be still real have be send here to support change and to fight to improve life it be my great regret that my father be no long alive to see elect it would have mean lot to he his advice to be make sure you always do your good because no one can ask more of you in my election acceptance speech promise my good to my constituent and repeat that promise

that we should all heed about civility in politic he speak about the diverse community spirit in his area but be not go to even begin to compete with he on how impressive the coastline be in my landlocked suburban constituency the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller speak about how special and sunny her constituency be she begin new competition now it be not only who have the most beautiful constituency but the sunny be very touch by her recognition of the importance of family for both inspiration and practical support in politic my hon friend the member for peterborough andrew pakes speak about his co operative and trade union value which think many of we labour members share do not know until he speak about the connection between peterborough and mustard so that be something have learn today think that his focus on the promise of new town really sum up our sense of optimism for the future there be the idea of be proud of one heritage and honest about the challenge that we face but he be also ready to achieve more in the future with government who support he wish he great stability in his seat the hon member for maidenhead mr reynolds give particularly rich history of his constituency which go from bridge to carry on movie and he also mention the spice girls think spice girls cd be the first ever buy but he may not know what cd be that sum up the different perspective we come from my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton james asser speak about the royal docks where spend much time in previous role work at city hall see the great potential that that area of the capital city have he eloquently set out the combination of heritage and diversity past and present that make his constituency such lively and wonderful place to represent make he an offer when he be jump on the elizabeth line to visit the hon member for maidenhead he can stop off at west ealing to say hello to the hon member for ynys môn llinos medi speak honestly about the importance of keep people in this place on their toe that be right the electorate do keep we on our toe and one of the great benefit of our system be the way in which we be bring down to earth every time we go back to our constituency on thursdays or fridays however great and important the debate in this place be when we knock on that door or sit down in our surgery we be bring right back down to earth it be great feature of our political system and she be right to draw attention to it my hon friend the member for kettering rosie wrighting speak about how proud she be of the history of the place that she now represent and where she grow up be very move to hear she speak about her mum role as local youth worker and how that inspire she to do what she be do in life wish she well as one of the young mps in this place my hon friend the member for wirral west matthew patrick speak about the natural beauty of his constituency he be not the first member to do so today and the passion of the people there his comment about politic be as much about listen as speak be particularly thoughtful we should all bear that in mind in this place he make an important point about learn from those with whom we disagree or maybe only appear to disagree and about break down barrier through listen and have conversation my hon friend the member for york outer mr charters speak about business and voluntary project in his constituency he underscore how important it be that taxpayer money be treat with respect know that the resident of york outer will be very well serve by the excellent new mp we hear from today my hon friend the member for earley and woodley yuan yang whom enjoy campaign with during the general election manage to inject some humour into economic which be quite an achievement for maiden speech be not even go to begin to try to replicate that in my comment just now but she speak passionately about the importance to those in her constituency of have access to nature and affordable housing know from what she say particularly about her personal experience that she will be true champion for break down barrier to opportunity finally we hear from my hon friend the member for falkirk euan stainbank and it be worth the wait to hear his wonderful speech he give fantastic whistle stop tour of his constituency and make many excellent recommendation of where to eat and drink next time we be in the area what really come across be how connected he be to the community he represent through his neighbour his friend and his family he use phrase that sum up well what and other government members want to do unite and serve those be all the maiden speech we have today it be truly excellent tour of not just the country but the talent we have in this place follow the general election wish all hon member very well for however many year they spend in this place we hear from other member about the substance of the bill include the shadow ministers they both seem bit confused about whether they support the obr and the bill be glad that they confirm that they support the bill and will not vote against it but at one point the hon member for grantham and bourne gareth davies seem to defend liz truss over her handling of the economy he must be pretty much the last person in the country willing to do so it be certainly brave of he we government member be clear on why the obr be so important and what its role should be the bill set out to strengthen that the hon gentleman ask what the purpose of the fiscal lock might be the fiscal lock will prevent the sidelining of the obr by give it the power to start an assessment if the government announce fiscally significant policy without one remind he that the current shadow chancellor say at the time of the disastrous mini budget that some of the difficulty be cause by the lack of forecast so this be something that the opposition agree with the shadow minister also ask about the definition of an emergency we be very clear that in emergency for instance during the pandemic it may be necessary for the government to take rapid action in those case it would not be appropriate to hold back the response to the emergency until forecast could be produce finally he ask whether the obr report trigger by the fiscal lock will be publish can answer he simply they will that be set out in section of the original budget responsibility and national audit act welcome the support from the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for richmond park sarah olney for the bill she ask about the definition of significant point also raise by my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy the threshold set out in the draft charter for budget responsibility which we have on the website be of gdp in any single financial year the purpose of the legislation be to prevent large irresponsible fiscal announcement that could undermine economic stability and that require threshold target at fiscally significant announcement that be why we have choose that figure in the draft legislation and the draft text publish on let mention two other member who speak in the debate welcome the support of the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan for the bill think that his only criticism be one word in the terminology and we can probably live with that he say that he be nauseous from hear we talk about be government of service but he may have to get use to feel nauseous because we will proudly be government of service every day that we have the honour to serve finally be glad that this be not an exceptional debate in which the hon member for strangford jim shannon do not make an intervention welcome his support for the bill and for the government wide action in resolve the junior doctor industrial dispute reassure he that like my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury recognise the importance of work with political representative from all nation in the uk as my right hon friend say at the beginning of this debate crucial first step to achieve sustain economic growth be deliver economic stability this bill will help provide that stability and ensure that fiscal responsibility be not only embed in our approach to government but lock into how government work from this point on it will make sure that there be always proper scrutiny of the government fiscal plan reinforce credibility and trust and make sure that no government can ever again play fast and loose with the public finance the bill be key step in fix the foundation of our country as we set out to get the economy grow and to make family across britain more secure and well off we now know that the conservatives call the election to run away from the problem that they have cover up rather than take the tough decision to fix they while they may have run away from the problem that they create they can not run away from their record in office people in britain will not forget the last government recklessness in which show just how much damage unfunded spending commitment can cause budget responsibility will never be optional under labour as it be under the conservatives we have bring fiscal responsibility back into the heart of government and we will hardwire it into law through our fiscal lock that be what this bill will achieve this bill will draw line under the economic recklessness of recent year and make it clear that it must never be allow to happen again budget responsibility underpin our national mission to make people across britain more secure and well off for that reason and other commend this bill to the house question put and agree to bill accordingly read second time
