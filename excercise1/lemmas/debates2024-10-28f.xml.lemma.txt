budget statement due later in the week but we be of course fully engage in that process we stand ready to speak to any council experience financial difficulty as confirm in my letter to mps just over week ago as the minister know have meet he to discuss this subject my local authority woking borough council effectively go bankrupt last year it have have to cut service that many consider essential and it will have to consider cut other do the minister agree that it be time for government and parliament to review which service be class as statutory and non statutory thank the hon member for meet at one of our regular drop in session his concern be reflect across the country local community recognise that their council be be force to choose vital neighbourhood service against target for adult social care child service and homelessness service in the end we need to rebuild the foundation from scratch and that be exactly what we be commit to do my constituency be largely rural and as in many rural constituency parish council play an important role in local government service delivery do the minister agree about the importance of parish council to rural community and what role do he see for parish council as part of the government devolution agenda we will of course publish white paper on the english devolution bill it will set out an ambitious programme for power shift from this place and whitehall to combined authority to local government and of course to community we be absolutely committed to that top to bottom power shift we recognise that parish and town council have role to play rise demand rise cost and year of conservative public sector cut mean that many local authority and service be at break point my own borough of lambeth deprived inner london area with high demand for social housing and temporary accommodation and for social public and youth service have be particularly affect which have be quite challenging will the minister commit to an emergency increase in funding to combat the immediate crisis for local authority and in the long term to much need update of the funding formula to well reflect local need like every member of the house my hon friend will know that those year have take their toll and that it will take more than three month to repair that but we be absolutely committed to repair the foundation and our multi year financial settlement will give security of course we recognise that the demand lead pressure in many place be the back end of big problem temporary accommodation relate to the housing crisis that need fix the same apply to child service and adult social care the financial future of west sussex county council be bleak it face cumulative budget gap of over million for at present of the council budget be be spend on adult and child social service and that be set to rise how will the minister ensure that west sussex county council and other do not have to close library cut bus route or reduce road repair in order to meet the grow demand for the most vulnerable member of our community we always say that local government be pay for one way or the other either we pay at the front end through fair funding be fairly distribute across the country or we pay at the back end because eventually the system fall over and we must repair the damage if we take ourselves back to the coalition year when austerity first come in the cruelty be that we do not reform public service repair they from the ground up to get ahead of those system change that be waste opportunity this year hartlepool borough council be set to overspend on child social care by some million due in no small part to the outrageous charge levy by private sector child home what can the minister do to cap those provider charge to ensure that local government can continue to deliver its statutory obligation recognise that in large part child service be the funding pressure that be drive council budget we can not forget though that behind every one of those number be child who often be not get the outcome they need far too often what we be see in the system be that high cost be not just send council to the point of bankruptcy but deliver bad outcome for young people we want to see far more resilience build back into the system and there be example today of council that be build that public sector provision back into the marketplace the previous government cut county durham budget by and we have all see the royal tunbridge wells video in which the leader of the opposition boast about that act that be have real impact on my constituent and the ability of durham county council to deliver vital service so will the minister consider discussion with cabinet colleague about revise those funding formula to take account of social care cost and deprivation we do see the former prime minister take great credit for essentially shift money from primarily urban and deprived community into rural shire in an overtly political way want to ensure that in the funding review we be carry out whether that be the initial rescue operation that will take place this year or the recovery operation through the multi year settlement we do not pit one council against another but take an approach that genuinely understand the need cost demand and cost pressure face by local authority in the end though we have to accept that there be no fair funding at all if funding do not reflect the deprivation in an area call the shadow secretary of state at the last oral question the secretary of state assure that she have no plan to increase council tax for anyone however when press by my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart she would not give the same guarantee that the single occupant discount would be retain will ministers take the opportunity to do so now can see the shadow secretary of state make that point repeatedly because at this stage we be all wait for the statement and the budget that will contain that information but can say that the right decision will be make in the interest of work people we recognise the cost of living crisis that be be face across the country be sure that she like all member of the house be wait with interest for wednesday local authority employ million people and commission service such as adult social care the impact assessment for the secretary of state employment rights bill say that the bill will increase cost those cost be likely to be pass on to council so have the secretary of state assess the impact of the employment rights bill and an increase in employer national insurance specifically on local authority if cost do increase will local council be compensate any decision relate to the budget will be take at the appropriate time as will any decision on the local government finance settlement what can say though be that this be new partnership from this government we be not lock local government out but stand shoulder to shoulder with it only last week at the local government association conference in harrogate the secretary of state launch the leader council forum where central and local government will reset that relationship call the liberal democrat spokesperson rough sleeping be the most visible end of the homelessness crisis but it be also brutal the average age of death for rough sleeper in london be just the rough sleep initiative be literally save life in bournemouth christchurch and poole people be keep alive every year through that programme but it be due to end in march remove it have be describe by local team as nothing short of catastrophic so what assessment have take place of the impact of that initiative and what assurance can the secretary of state give local authority about the maintenance of the scheme so that they can plan for the long term again ask hon member to wait for the spending review on wednesday and for the provisional settlement in december we be under no illusion about the pressure face by council on homelessness in the end we need to repair the system which be about provide safe secure and affordable housing for people to live in we will do that

really do pay minister have acknowledge in reply to early question that they recognise the financial pressure be place on local authority especially in connection with child service and adult social care whatever may or may not be in the budget can the minister reassure council tax payer that they will not bear an undue burden as result of any change this government be acutely aware of the impact of the cost of live crisis on work people and that be firmly in our sight as we approach the spending review this week but we will have to repair fair amount of the system not just the finance the early warning audit have be leave shatter follow year of mismanagement and single year settlement have leave council not know from one year to the next how much money they have to spend so we will have to introduce multi year settlement there be great deal of work to do and we can not repair year of damage in three month but we be well on the way to it let first draw attention to my declare interest as trustee of fields in trust in the last parliament the housing communities and local government committee receive large amount of evidence concern the importance of well design open space for child and young people but the national planning policy framework mention they once and mention bat twice be it not about time we get our priority right and do more to improve the design of order just minute please one of we will have to give way the hon gentleman be one of the most senior member of parliament he should be look at when he be ask question not at the minister come on clive be well look will agree with you on the latter point mr speaker will the minister tell we whether he will change the guidance in future to place more emphasis on the importance to child and young people of properly design open space but not in this instance laughter the national planning policy guidance will recognise the importance of high quality open space and opportunity for sport physical activity health and wellbee in our community our proposal to release grey belt land for development will depend on developer meet one of the golden rule and ensure that all new development have accessible green space my constituency like most other be see great deal of new housing be build which mean more infrastructure more business and more opportunity for growth key to that however be access to reliable high speed broadband give the snp government previous failure to deliver gigabit broadband to every home as promise can the minister tell we what discussion be take place and what consideration be be give to support its efficient delivery in scotland through project gigabit we have commitment to level up all community in the united kingdom and through the welcome work of my right hon friend the deputy prime minister we have commitment to reset relationship with the devolved administration hopefully by put those two together we will be able to make significant progress thank the secretary of state for everything that she be do to tackle islamo phobia this anti muslim discourse be scourge on our community in burnley padiham and brierfield will she join in celebrate the work of local volunteer church mosque lancashire police and other who organise burnley diversity picnic bubbles in the park and who work so successfully in avert potential disturbance over the

work of volunteer in community and public servant who give their time and energy to strengthen our local area and bring people together talland parade be an abandon and dilapidated row of shop in seaford in my constituency it have stand empty for year despite have planning permission in place for much need flat the council have to take the developer to the high court just to get some scaffolding remove at the site will the minister meet to discuss the site and will the government consider expand compulsory purchase power for council to allow they to acquire such key site be grateful for the question of course would be very happy to have meeting point the hon gentleman towards the very helpful innovation of high street rental auction at the back end of this year which will give local authority the tool to bring into use vacant unit and to make sure that developer know that they must use they or let somebody else do so the plan increase in housing supply be crucial as we all know but my resident in west lancashire be concerned about access to service can the secretary of state tell we what she be do to ensure that the increase in housing supply be meet with the relevant infrastructure and access to service it be incredibly important that the relevant infrastructure amenity and service be in place we have take number of step to well support that in the short period we have be in office not least through the national planning policy framework but there be more to be do in that area will keep it under very close review what assessment have the secretary of state make of the merit of reform the planning system to introduce new measure to help reduce flood risk the national planning policy framework be very clear that inappropriate development in area at risk of flooding should be avoid by direct development away from area at high risk include flood plain we consult in the national planning policy framework consultation and seek view on how the planning system can more effectively manage flood risk as say my department be analyse response with view to publish government response before the end of the year call the chair of the select committee the secretary of state will know the financial difficulty face so many of our local authority recent local government association report show that one in four local authority will apply for additional funding it be fair to say that for number of they march will be too late what discussion have be have with the chancellor to ensure that our local authority get emergency support may welcome the chair of the select committee to her place she will do an outstanding job for local government and housing the government absolutely understand how difficult it be for local authority to make end meet we understand that the pressure in adult social care child social service and temporary accommodation be bite hard and we be work through those issue with the sector speaker statement before the next business have short statement to make in medium interview last week the chancellor announce that she intend to introduce change to the fiscal rule relate to the funding of to day spending through tax receipt and to the measurement of public debt these be major new policy announcement with significant and wide range implication for the government fiscal policy and for the public finance it be evident to that they should therefore have be make in this house in the first instance and not to the world medium this principle be clearly and unambiguously set out in paragraph of the ministerial code while this can hardly be describe as leak the chancellor herself give interview on the record and on camera the premature disclosure of the content of the budget have always be regard as supreme discourtesy to the house indeed still regard it as such be very disappointed that the chancellor expect the house to wait nearly full week to hear she repeat the announcement in the budget statement on wednesday have always defend the undoubted right of this house include the opposition party and back benchers in all part of the house to be the first to hear major government policy announcement when such announcement be make ministers should expect to face proper sustained scrutiny from the elect member of this house not american news channel can assure the government that that be still my firm view and that will use the power have to make sure the house be able to hold ministers to account be glad that there will be statement later on fiscal rule perhaps that be no coincidence hon member may be wonder how they will get seat on wednesday but to be quite honest the way it be go they will not need one as we will have hear it all already this be not acceptable and do not want it to continue want this house government and opposition to be treat with the respect it deserve it be totally unacceptable to go around the world tell everyone rather than member of this house they be elect by the constituent of this country and they deserve to be treat well when the conservatives be the government it be labour complain to get your act together on all side and treat member with respect china human rights and sanctions remind the house that the case of christopher berry and christopher cash be sub judice and no reference should be make to it in the house urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make statement on his recent visit to china on china report human right abuse in xinjiang on the case of jimmy lai and on sanction on british parliamentarian thank the right hon gentleman for his question on china this government be clear that the uk national interest will always come first pragmatic engagement matter not only to co operate on share challenge but to make progress in area where we disagree on my visit make it clear that chinese company must stop supply equipment to russia that be be use in ukraine also highlight north korean recklessness in step up its support for putin threat to european security and stability in the korean peninsula be robust on human right include in xinjiang raise our serious concern which the right hon gentleman have also raise on many occasion about the implementation of the national security law in hong kong and call for the immediate release of british national jimmy lai call on beijing to lift its unwarranted sanction against parliamentarian include the right hon gentleman this be matter that raise with you mr speaker before attend raise taiwan and warn that cyber activity or interference in our democracy be unacceptable and will always be meet by strong response also cover area of mutual interest china be the world big emitter so we need to co operate on the global green transition it be also the world second large economy and our trade with china be worth almost billion china have the large number of ai unicorn of any country worldwide like the last government we will work with china to create rule to keep the public safe this be grow up diplomacy after year of inconsistency under the conservatives this government will set long term consistent and strategic approach to china with foreign minister wang yi agree to maintain channel of communication at ministerial level this bring we up to speed with the united states whose secretary of state and treasury secretary have both make two visit in the past month as well as with partner include australia france and germany this government be currently carry out china audit to improve our response to the challenge and opportunity that china present to the uk once it be complete will gladly update the house again thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker china be even now carry out military exercise threaten taiwan and threaten to blockade it which would damage all our economy yet see in the foreign office readout after the visit to china that there be absolutely no discussion of that issue why not on human right in xinjiang the house of commons include the labour party in opposition vote that genocide be take place in xinjiang yet the foreign office readout simply say human right be discuss this be genocide take place with slave labour why be there not more robust condemnation from the government to china in jimmy lai case he be british citizen and prisoner in hong kong for commit no crime whatever do the foreign secretary not only call for his release as he just say but demand full consular right of access on sanction on british parliamentarian the week before last the leader of the opposition ask the prime minister whether the foreign secretary would tell the chinese government to lift the sanction on parliamentarian the prime minister say that he would however see from the foreign office read out that the foreign secretary do not even raise that let alone call on the chinese government to lift those sanction give your brave support mr speaker for those of we who be sanction simply ask why the government can not follow suit and demand that from the chinese have just hear this be my final point that there be move in the foreign office to lift british sanction on chinese official responsible for the brutal genocide in xinjiang as deal to lift the sanction on parliamentarian here must tell the foreign secretary that for one would never accept such shameful deal at any price and hope that he will stamp on that straightaway will he make it clear what our real position be on what be become clear and massive threat to our freedom thank the right hon gentleman again for his interest in my travel but have to correct he on few point do of course raise xinjiang in the context of human right absolutely raise as assure you mr speaker that would the position of parliamentarian of course do not just with the foreign minister but with the foreign affair spokesperson for the chinese communist party raise that as matter of huge concern also raise the threat and aggression that we be now see in the south china sea jimmy lai raise member of this house raise xinjiang raise hong kong raise it would be totally unacceptable for any uk foreign minister to go to china and not raise those issue of tremendous concern the right hon gentleman know that the previous government bounce around on china they have golden era he be part of the government who have that golden era and be drink pint with president xi former prime minister and foreign secretary be find to be lobby on behalf of chinese belt and road initiative so be not go to take any lesson from the opposition on how to handle china call the chair of the select committee on foreign affairs my right hon friend have rightly outline the complex nature of our relationship with china may add to the long list the tension in the strait of taiwan and the effect that that be likely to have on international trade if it go wrong the fact that the relationship be complicated however do not mean that we should not get clarity that be important not just for member of the house but for other whether they be promote british export overseas or be human right campaigner such as sebastien lai whom meet last week or be british representative in mongolia we need clarity in our approach to china so we urgently need to know when the china audit will be complete will my right hon friend tell we when that be likely to happen and will he also commit to appear before my committee to answer question about it yes of course will appear before my right hon friend committee whenever she command to answer question she be absolutely right the issue in the taiwan strait be very serious raise those issue in china and also in indonesia and in korea we need consistent approach to china which be why we be do the audit it be my hope that it will be complete early next year call the shadow minister congratulate my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on secure this urgent question and thank you mr speaker for grant it it be disappointing but not surprising that the foreign secretary do not see fit to update the house follow his visit to china want to press he on what the visit achieve because compare the read out would be forgive for think that two very separate visit take place the opposition understand the importance of engagement but not at any cost all interaction with the chinese communist party must be clear eyed and part of meaningful strategy as per the high level china strategy that the foreign secretary inherit from our government yet as he say this visit occur before this government have conclude their so call china audit would it not have be well to wait until he know what interest he be seek to defend and far on the conservative benches it look as if the foreign secretary rush into engagement without plan concerningly in fundamental breach of the constitutional principle that parliament be sovereign he be willing to pressure parliamentarian into cancel the visit of former president tsai of taiwan the week before his trip unlike in an autocratic state the government do not tell members of parliament who they can or can not meet indeed the conservative government tell the ccp on multiple occasion that no it could not shut and other member up despite its request we be tell that the foreign secretary raise british citizen jimmy lai sham detention jimmy be and be be hold in solitary confinement yet the foreign secretary still have not meet jimmy son despite his come to the uk on multiple occasion and ask for meeting will the foreign secretary now meet sebastien to update he on his father prospect and will he share with we the outcome of his visit will jimmy lai now be release will the chinese communist party now step back from its human right abuse in hong kong xinjiang and tibet will sanction on mps now be lift will the chinese communist party now refrain from action to support russia war machine and the intimidation of taiwan will the transnational oppression of hongkongers and uyghurs now end which of those objective do the foreign secretary achieve thank to his visit it be easy to say that the visit be reset in relation but as we all know in every relationship there be giver and taker have the foreign secretary not simply prove that he give and they take really that be quite bad the leader and the foreign minister of the united states have have eight engagement with china france have have six germany have have four japan have have three and canada have have two the right hon member for braintree mr cleverly go once and the hon lady ask what have achieve will go again and again to get outcome in the uk national interest the hon lady would expect nothing less give the various global challenge we face fully appreciate that strategic dialogue with china be in our national interest in the light of the persecution and diabolical treatment of uyghur muslims christians buddhists falun gong follower and pro democracy hongkongers to name but few it be however important that human right concern be raise can my right hon friend assure that he raise those human right concern forthrightly with his chinese counterpart assure my hon friend that raise those issue robustly there be disagreement across the table on what the chinese government maintain that they be do particularly in xinjiang and in relation to minority mr wang yi suggest that be confused in my account of the treatment of minority assure my hon friend that we will however continue to raise these issue robustly and to hold the chinese government to account call the liberal democrat spokesperson we remain deeply concerned by beijing abuse of human right and disregard for international law too often the previous government pursue trade link instead of act on these concern will this government now do the right thing and recognise that the crime perpetrate against the uyghurs amount to the crime of genocide china be not listen to the uk on hong kong jimmy lai remain in prison and the police have offer bounty in relation to pro democracy activist will the foreign secretary now put action on the table include review our position on hong kong autonomy and whether it should continue to receive preferential custom status can he assure the house that hongkongers who have seek refuge in the uk be receive proper protection finally give that taiwan be democratic ally can the foreign secretary assure the house that his department play no part in prevent parliament from host former president tsai do not recognise what be suggest in relation to taiwan assure the hon gentleman that jimmy lai case be priority for the government and will remain so we continue to press for consular access to jimmy lai and for his release diplomat from our consulate general in hong kong attend his court proceeding on regular basis to keep abreast of what be take place on taiwan our position remain the same in all our engagement with the chinese government we will continue to challenge they robustly on all these issue he suggest that the last government put trade first we will not be put trade first but there be clearly area where we can and should co operate with china as well as area where we will challenge china as we must be honour to have meet sebastien lai and his legal team who be fight for the release of his father jimmy lai jimmy be and diabetic and there be serious concern about his ill health in solitary confinement jimmy be man of faith he be roman catholic who be be deny holy communion how very cruel that be at his stage of life and in his condition his crime be stand up for freedom and democracy sebastien have be do all he can but he need assistance and respectfully request that senior figure in government get his father british citizen release will the foreign secretary commit to meet jimmy lai family and will he ask the chancellor to do the same ahead of her visit to china next year of course will commit to meet sebastien and his family when raise the issue of jimmy lai point to his age and the fact that it would be an abomination if he die in prison assure my hon friend that that issue be raise mr speaker as one of the parliamentarian who have be sanction by the chinese regime thank you for your ongoing advocacy on our behalf let we never forget that the chinese regime be literally spy on we as member of this house in opposition the labour party say there be clear and compelling evidence of genocide in xinjiang now that the right hon gentleman be the foreign secretary be he prepare to repeat that statement do he still believe there be clear and compelling evidence of genocide in xinjiang or have he change his mind remain hugely concerned about the human right abuse in xinjiang but the hon gentleman know that it must always rightfully be matter for the international criminal court and other to make determination of genocide not for national government follow his recent visit to china the foreign secretary also meet with our partner in south korea do he share my concern about report of north korean troop take part in russia illegal invasion of ukraine and do he raise that go up to the demilitarised zone to see for myself some of the harassment that south korea receive on daily basis from north korea and of course raise the issue in china and with the south korean president himself there be huge concern about this development which be escalatory in nature and must command response in the come day give the unprecedented threat that china pose to uk national security and indeed global security and the clear and compelling evidence mention by my hon friend the member for harborough oadby and wigston neil of genocide in xinjiang which the foreign secretary be strangely shy about condemn these day why have the government delay the implementation of the foreign influence registration scheme vital transparency measure that the conservative party introduce when in government that scheme be important it be hugely important that country of concern do not have undue influence in relation to our national security on business and industry we will come forward with our plan in due course much like jimmy lai in hong kong british egyptian writer and pro democracy activist alaa abd el fattah remain unlawfully detain in egypt and still have not be grant access to british consular official despite the british government raise the case at the high level his mother laila be now on hunger strike against his continued imprisonment in november the foreign secretary call on the then british government to take more direct action to bring alaa home recognise the uk government responsibility to protect citizen from arbitrary detention and human right abuse abroad since come to office what have the foreign secretary and the government do to follow through on what he once promise and to bring alaa home order the urgent question be purely about hong kong know that there be slight connection there be similarity yes but judge the similarity not your good self if the foreign secretary wish to take it fine if he do not understand assure the hon lady that meet with alaa abd el fattah family just few week ago and raise the issue once again with the egyptian foreign minister in subsequent call like every member in my constituency receive hundred of representation from hongkonger in this country who be concerned about their own safety have experience of it myself be film by drone while speak at hong kong protest in edinburgh but they be also concerned about their family at home what assurance can the foreign secretary give we about the safety of hongkongers in this country and more importantly about plug the gap in the british national overseas scheme the national security law be of great concern which be why raise it with the foreign minister of course hong kong national should be assure of their safety in this country our police and security service keep these thing under close scrutiny can the foreign secretary confirm that on his recent visit to the indo pacific he raise the uk continue commitment to aukus and to general engagement on security in the region absolutely we be committed to aukus and the development of pillar particularly as believe the foreign secretary be an honest man be perfectly prepared to accept that he raise these matter of human right as forcefully as he say he do so there must be something wrong with the foreign office reporting because that forcefulness do not find its way into its account of the visit be one reason why his official be reluctant to relay what really happen the fact that we be overdependent on china and have he make an assessment of what would happen in term of our dependence on china be heaven forbid conflict to break out over taiwan the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise dependency one thing that the china audit will look at be that very issue and the assessment that he refer to be be make not just by we but by our close ally do the secretary of state agree that the sanction impose on democratically elect member of this house be wholly unacceptable and what discussion do he have with chinese counterpart to that effect tell wang yi the foreign minister that it be not just unacceptable but counterproductive and that it need to end those be my exact word of course we be all pleased to hear both the foreign secretary and the prime minister describe the release of jimmy lai as priority in the foreign secretary meeting with his chinese counterpart what priority be give to the release of jimmy lai and give its priority status when do the foreign secretary expect we to see measurable progress be make on jimmy lai release and what will that progress look like progress be jimmy lai release that be the position of the uk government can not tell the hon gentleman when that will be because we be not hold he the chinese be hold he we continue to say that he should be release that be our position do the foreign secretary agree that it be travesty that jimmy lai remain detain and that he should be release immediately to return to his family yes thank the foreign secretary for actually come to the house on this occasion but do that not underline the fact that he should have volunteer statement rather than be force to the dispatch box by an urgent question have listen to these exchange be member of the house not still entitle to ask what exactly the government overall strategic policy be towards china give for example the huge build up of nuclear weapon that china be fund develop and building will he bring to the house proper and full statement or even white paper that set out that strategy once and for all let just reassure he that be one of the many conservative colleague who be open mouthed in astonishment when we announce that we be go to have golden era with that communist dictatorship and never have anything to do with it the hon gentleman be right we must have consistent sustained position on china that be why we be undertake china audit and will of course update the house when it be complete thank the foreign secretary for his update his constructive tone and his defence of human right in the region be the audit government wide and will it only consider the situation now or look into future scenario as well it be important when we come into government give the bounce around that we see in the last government policy towards china that we do complete audit right across whitehall of our interest and the opportunity as well as of the challenge and security concern so that we could maintain consistent position before that audit be complete we be be guide as have say by the three cs there be area in which we co operate area in which we compete and there must be area as have come up this afternoon in which we challenge in the foreign secretary self declaredly robust conversation with the chinese government do he give time limit for lift sanction on british politician include member of this house and do he outline the consequence if that be not meet or be his talk just chat and not robust do not give timeline simply say that the sanction should be lift and explain why it be just wrong and counterproductive to sanction member of democratic chamber like this that be my position and defend it think that be the right thing to say raise the issue with mr speaker before leave just to be absolutely clear on the current status although one can not be entirely sure that what one be conveying be go in and be properly understand do detect that wang yi recognise that this be big issue between our two country appreciate the foreign secretary come here to make much clear our view on china and particularly human right abuse there people from hong kong live in milton keynes be still fearful of intimidation and concerned about china influence on some of our university what assessment have he make of that and how will he proceed with the chinese government to ensure that those influence stop coercion and threat be unacceptable we have make that clear to the chinese government and make it clear again my hon friend constituent should be reassure that the police and security service monitor these issue very closely but hope that in time might be able to meet some of her constituent to fully understand their concern over the last few week have meet number of hong kong advocacy group who have outline how withholding bno visa holder access to mandatory provident fund account and the launch of volunteer recruitment scheme by the chinese embassy be spread fear of creep chinese influence on our street what discussion have the foreign secretary have with the chinese government on end transnational repression of hongkongers in my constituency and across the country as have say raise the issue of the national security law and our long stand concern about hong kong concern that will not go away because of the uk unique relationship with that part of the world and many business and community there that be the way in which raise those issue and think our concern be understand welcome the foreign secretary confirmation that he will meet the family of jimmy lai but do he agree that as china be the world large emitter we need to engage with china pragmatically as we work to tackle the climate crisis yes there be no way to reduce global temperature without work with china to achieve that so that be big topic of discussion between our two country in our meeting as say will go back because it be important that we engage with china just as our ally do we can not influence china if we step back and do not go there at all that make no sense another topic that do not seem to make it into the foreign office read out on the foreign secretary meeting be taiwan but think he confirm in answer to my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith that that topic be discuss could he specify little more clearly what he say and be he clear about the uk red line on taiwan specifically discuss the aggression that we be see in the taiwan strait and maintain our long stand position on taiwan we be very concerned about an escalatory pattern of behaviour and of course raise those concern in robust manner york outer have vibrant community of hongkongers who want to secure jimmy lai release can my right hon friend confirm that he will raise the issue of jimmy lai every single time he meet chinese official until he be safely release reassure my hon friend that that be the case he can sense the strength of feeling on the issue in the chamber so many member from across the house have speak of jimmy lai today that be why every uk minister who engage with china will raise jimmy lai case the foreign secretary be enthusiastic about give trillion of pound of uk taxpayer money in reparation for slavery that occur hundred of year ago however when it come to modern day slavery in china despite what he state be say privately all we get publicly be mealy mouthed press release read out from the foreign office that do not even mention the issue specifically why be that be it because the government realise that we be now dependent on china for many thing include the delivery of the net zero policy china control of the rare earth metal that we will need to deliver renewable energy we have leave ourselves open to that kind of blackmail and now we can not speak up against human right abuse the right hon gentleman have point this government have be in power for three month and we have lot to clear up give the mess that be leave to we he be right about that that work begin with the china audit do the foreign secretary agree that when it come to emerge technology such as artificial intelligence it be vital to co ordinate rule globally include with china to protect british people and our technological infrastructure yes the obstruction of the supply of taiwanese semiconductor pose an existential threat to the uk economy and our whole way of life do the foreign secretary come away from his visit reassure that our supply chain be likely to be safe for the foreseeable future if not what will he do to mitigate that threat by grow our indigenous capacity order can gently say that member should look at when they be ask question not at the foreign secretary as tempting as that be want question to be do in the third person to keep thing calm the right hon gentleman raise an important issue that point be why my right hon friend the secretary of state for business and trade be engage on an industrial policy as we speak and why the debate must go on about friendshore and how we work with partner to make sure that we have access to not just semiconductor but rare earth mineral and can work on issue that be critical to our security we must do far more than be achieve under the last government draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests thank the foreign secretary for make it clear that jimmy lai release be priority and join hon member in say that the issue be urgent not just because of his fail health but because once the trial restart on november it will be more difficult to bring the situation to positive conclusion the foreign secretary mention the need for consistent strategy towards china consistent not just from he but from the whole of government china react to naked economic self interest so can he make sure that the matter be raise across government by the business secretary on issue of trade by the net zero secretary on issue of green energy as my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe tony vaughan mention and by the education secretary when it come to education so that we appeal to that self interest could not agree more with my hon friend there have to be cross government approach it be not just for the foreign secretary to engage other ministers have to engage with their counterpart mindful of the three cs there will be many area in which we will co operate but there be area where we compete and area where we have to challenge we can do that only if we go there and engage which be why the united states france australia japan italy and canada have make so many more visit than we the foreign secretary give comprehensive list of the matter that he raise and he hint at the reaction when he raise they but he have not tell we that anything will change as result of the discussion will give he chance to do that what will happen to the plight of the uyghur muslims as result of his visit the uyghur muslims be be horrendously treat persecute and pursue during the year of the last government so it be crass to suggest that after three month we could simply achieve different result diplomacy be about constantly engage to bring about result and that be what will continue to do in may the director of gchq say we want to engage with china where it mutually beneficial but that china pose genuine and increase risk to the uk cyber security do the foreign secretary think that gchq have the resource it need to protect we from chinese cyber attack one of the most impressive part of government that have see in my three month in this job be the work of gchq fiscal event be about to happen so hesitate to talk about the finance available to gchq but my hon friend can be absolutely sure that have make the case for it because it deserve the fund and do great job to keep we all safe ambiguity can sometimes be helpful in diplomacy but it be less helpful when answer direct question about the action of the government here at home the foreign secretary have be somewhat evasive in answer some of the question today so let ask just one of they again do any of his official play any part in the decision to stop the visit by president tsai the former president of taiwan yes or no do not recognise the caricature be put about on this at all really do not have meet many ukrainian refugee who be be generously house in my constituency and they be extremely concerned about country such as iran and north korea provide matériel support to putin war machine can the foreign secretary agree with that china and chinese company should not provide any support to putin illegal invasion of ukraine yes can this be very serious issue that put to the foreign minister we have evidence that chinese part with dual use capability be turn up in russia and they be take life in ukraine which be entirely unacceptable my hon friend will not be surprised that the chinese deny this but we have the evidence and we put it on the table will the foreign secretary assure the house that the uk will not seek to resume the economic and financial dialogue that be pause after the imposition of the hong kong national security law give that more than of the component use to prosecute putin illegal war in ukraine come from china the hon member again raise this serious issue in the house it be entirely unacceptable and we will continue to engage on it the foreign secretary mention how he raise with the government in beijing the russian human right abuse in ukraine carry out during russia aggression chinese delegation be absent from the peace conference in switzerland yet president xi be present in russia at the brics summit last week when the foreign secretary raise with chinese counterpart these russian human right abuse what be the response the hon member will not be surprised to hear that the chinese deny it but we be able to supply some evidence to back up our claim for they to reflect on and we will re engage to see what conclusion they come to can emphasise to the secretary of state how important it be to have the right answer to these question as chair of the all party parliamentary group on international freedom of religion or belief have raise the issue of human right abuse repeatedly in this house include at business question every thursday with the former government so welcome this new government and with they new approach to our international obligation how will the secretary of state use any and every weapon in our arsenal to secure help for the uyghur muslims for jimmy lai he be practise roman catholic and he be be deny the eucharist but it be his right to have his own religious belief and for the christians falun gong and other ethnic group in china and when will this begin in earnest the hon gentleman be right to combine those issue and also to encourage to mention not just our bilateral engagement with china but our co ordinate work with our ally to engage with china it be the case think particularly with our ally that there be more we can do that complete the urgent question in fairness to the foreign secretary would just say that we do have meeting he be absolutely correct about the situation face some member of this house we be absolutely committed to ensure that those sanction be lift and that be part of the conversation middle east with permission mr speaker will make statement on the middle east after over year of horrify violence civilian suffering have increase the conflict have widen the risk of yet wide regional war have rise today want to address three element of this crisis and outline the urgent step that the government be take in response will first consider event over the weekend targeted israeli strike hit military site inside iran include missile manufacturer and an air defence base this be in response to iran escalatory ballistic missile attack on israel which have be condemn across the house these attack be the late in long history of malign iranian activity include its nuclear programme with its total enriched uranium stockpile now report by the international atomic energy agency to be time the joint comprehensive plan of action limit and political financial and military support for militia include hezbollah and hamas let be clear the government unequivocally condemn iranian attack on israel this government have impose three round of sanction on iranian individual and organisation responsible for malign activity most recently on october and we have consistently support israel right to defend itself against iranian attack and attack by iranian back terrorist whose goal be the complete eradication of the israeli state we do not mourn the death of the head of proscribe terrorist organisation the priority now be immediate de escalation iran should not respond all side must exercise restraint we do not wish to see the cycle of violence intensify drag the whole region into war with severe consequence escalation be in no one interest as it risk spread the regional conflict far we and our partner have be pass this message clearly and consistently yesterday speak to iranian foreign minister araghchi and israeli foreign minister katz and urge both country to show restraint and avoid further regional escalation let turn to the devastating situation in northern gaza where the united nations estimate that over palestinian civilian remain access to essential service worsen by the day yet still very little aid be be allow in israel evacuation order in the north have displace ten of thousand of palestinian civilian drive from destruction disease and despair to destruction disease and despair nine in gazans have be displace since the war begin some have have to flee more than time in the past year what must parent say to their child how can they explain this living nightmare how can they reassure that it will end there be no excuse for the israeli government ongoing restriction on humanitarian assistance they must let more aid in now aid be back up at gaza border in many case fund by the uk and our partner but now stick out of reach of those who need it so desperately these restriction fly in the face of israel public commitment they risk violate international humanit arian law they be rebuke to every friend of israel who month after month have demand action to address the catastrophic condition face palestinian civilian so let be clear once again this government condemn these restriction in the strong term since our first day in office the government have lead effort to bring this nightmare to an end we have announce funding for uk med effort to provide medical treatment in gaza for unicef work to support vulnerable family in gaza and for egyptian health facility treat medically evacuate palestinians from gaza we be match donation to the disasters emergency committee middle east humanitarian appeal together with france and algeria we call an emergency un security council meeting to address the dire situation we have sanction extremist settler make it clear that their action do not serve the real interest of either israel or the region we have move quickly to restore funding to the united nations relief and works agency turn the position of the last government we do that to support unrwa indispensable role in assist palestinians and to enable it to implement the recommendation of the independent colonna report all over the world in every war zone in every refugee camp the united nations be beacon of hope so it be matter of profound regret that the israeli parliament be consider shut down unrwa operation the allegation against unrwa staff early this year be fully investigate and offer no jurisdiction for cut off tie with unrwa this weekend we therefore join partner in express concern at the knesset legislation and urge israel to ensure that unrwa lifesave work continue we call on unrwa to continue its path to reform demonstrate its commitment to the principle of neutrality finally will cover the conflict in lebanon country that have endure so much in my lifetime and now see fighting escalate once again kill many civilian and force hundred of thousand from their home while in northern israel community live in fear of hezbollah attack and be unable to return home here too the government have lead effort to respond our swift call for an immediate ceasefire be take up by our partner in the united nations security council the defence secretary and have visit lebanon where britain ongoing support for the lebanese armed force be widely recognise as an investment in sovereign and effective lebanese state at the start of october announce million for the humanitarian crisis in lebanon last week the minister for development my right hon friend the member for oxford east anneliese dodds announce further funding for the most vulnerable among those flee from lebanon into syria while the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend the member for lincoln hamish falconer join the lebanon support conference in paris today my right hon friend the prime minister will meet prime minister mikati to reassure he of our support across the region our priority be clear de escalation humanitarian assistance immediate ceasefire uphold international law and political solution this be how we save life how we liberate hostage such as british national emily damari and how we pull the region back from the brink the government have step up our diplomatic engagement to that end the prime minister have speak directly to prime minister netanyahu and to president pezeshkian while have make five visit to the region in just four month and hold around call and meeting with ministers and leader in the region speak this weekend to us secretary blinken just back from the region it be source of deep frustration that those effort have not yet succeed we have no illusion about the deep seat division in this region region scar by fight and false dawn in the past but it be never too late for peace and never too late for hope this government will not give up on the people of the region we will keep play our part in achieve last solution so that one day they might all live side by side in peace and security commend this statement to the house call the shadow foreign secretary may thank the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement and may also thank the foreign office for its significant help with my visit to ukraine at the end of last week israel response to the attack launch by iran early this month have rightly be describe as proportionate israel have the right to defend itself and it have do so in precise and target way the statement by the israel defence forces that it be mission accomplish offer hope that the operation might mark the end of the late trading of hostility whether and how the iranians respond remain to be see but the head of the islamic revolutionary guard corps say that the bitter consequence will be unimaginable for israel the situation remain dangerously uncertain we join the government in urge restraint the onus must surely now be on iran to desist from any retaliatory action that will pull the region far up the ladder of escalation above all we must now use britain undoubted international connection experience responsibility and clout to lift people eye to the day after in the hope that we can build on the abraham accord and move towards the two state solution that palestinians and israelis deserve that must be the immutable end of these appalling circumstance and event what discussion have the foreign secretary have with his other counterpart in the region to encourage cool head to prevail that also apply to lebanon iran direct missile attack on israel be but one front in its campaign against the jewish state which we know it be intent on wipe off the face of the earth iran continue funding for and support of its hezbollah proxy in lebanon and hamas proxy in gaza show what scourge the irgc be and how far its tentacle have spread hezbollah and hamas be cancer in the area where they operate israel have every right to defend itself against evil terrorist who be not interested in compromise or in political solution and who use the legitimate plight of palestinians to justify barbarism in the face of such murderous assault as the incessant rocket bombardment of northern israel by hezbollah no country in the world not single one would be expect to sit quietly it be for that reason that in respect of lebanon in particular call for ceasefire be most unlikely to be heed not only be hezbollah violate every international law by lob rocket and missile at israeli town and displace ten of thousand of israeli civilian it be do so in flagrant breach of un security council resolution which clearly call for the withdrawal of hezbollah and other force from lebanon south of the litani and the disarmament of hezbollah and other armed group do the foreign secretary agree that the retreat and dismantle of hezbollah in accordance with un security council resolution must be necessary precondition to end the war what discussion have he have with our partner in the un to achieve that turn to gaza some hostage remain in captivity with the prospect of their release diminish with every day that pass the civilian in gaza continue to pay heavy price as result of hamas use they as human shield and total disregard for the safety and security of the civilian population over the weekend in kamal adwan hospital in jabalia northern gaza israel find stash of weapon and money gazan ambulance driver have confirm that hamas operative embed themselves among civilian and even use ambulance to transport terrorist and weapon in other word hamas use the infrastructure that be suppose to help civilian to advance the group terrorist agenda leave innocent people neglect and dangerously expose we support the disasters emergency committee appeal and hope that shortly we will see similar appeal launch for sudan where people be in desperate danger of starvation this winter surely it be time to face fact hamas must lay down their arm hamas must release the hostage once this happen the war will end aid can flood into gaza unfettere the palestinian people can begin the long and difficult path to recovery and we can start to lift the eye of israelis and palestinians to the possibility of political horizon of two state of peace thank the shadow foreign secretary for the tone of his remark and for the cross party support he give to the government in urge restraint and de escalation in the region reassure he that speak with secretary blinken just two day ago about the context of the day after as the right hon gentleman put it about the necessary security guarantee that israel would rightly expect and about how we work with arab partner qatar the uae saudi arabia egypt and other to ensure that this ceasefire can hold and that the security guarantee and the necessary rebuilding of gaza can properly begin the shadow foreign secretary rightly talk about the dec appeal for gaza which be now up and support what he say about sudan which must not be overlook at this time speak to foreign minister katz about the situation in lebanon yesterday he seek to reassure that the target operation by the israelis that be under way would come to an end shortly as he put it confirm as know the right hon gentleman would have that we understand that it be important that israelis who can not be in their home in northern israel be able to move back that can be the case only when hezbollah have move back beyond the litani river and resolution be properly implement we want to see that happen and it be for that reason that we continue to support the lebanese armed force and the work of unifil we be very concerned to see unifil worker attack in the way that they be few day ago also raise that with foreign minister katz welcome the foreign secretary statement but thousand of my constituent in battersea want an end to this violence and to israel siege in northern gaza not to mention the violence in the west bank ten of thousand of people have lose their life no aid be get in and hospital be be target be it not time to move away from condemn and to take strong action suspend any trade negotiation with israel implement complete arm sale ban and ensure that good produce in settlement in the west bank be also ban israel be ignore all the condemnation by this government we need strong action understand the strength of feeling that my dear friend express in relation to this matter and the way that she have champion these issue on behalf of her constituent the humanitarian situation be dire as we head to the winter the prospect of it get bad be hard to fathom but do not agree with she on full arm embargo and the reason be exemplify by the attack from iran that israel suffer on october it would be quite wrong for we not to be prepare to support israel in theatre of conflict beyond gaza notwithstanding our concern on international humanitarian law be afraid can not agree with she on that issue call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement he have our full support in his effort to engage with iran and israel to urge an end to the cycle of retaliatory violence we continue to urge he to proscribe the irgc can he confirm whether uk military asset and personnel play any part in israel attack on iran on friday night the relationship between israel and palestine remain the key to reduce tension and create the condition for peace we support the government stance on unrwa but as the humanitarian situation in northern gaza continue to deteriorate and the level of violence in the west bank worsen the liberal democrats hope that the foreign secretary might go far offer more than word of condemnation follow the international court of justice advisory opinion this summer that the occupation be illegal do he agree that introduce legislation to cease uk trade with illegal israeli settlement be practical way of uphold that judgment can he update the house on whether the letter to the israeli government co sign by the chancellor have result in commitment to maintain financial correspondence between israeli and palestinian bank to signal commitment to two state solution will the government support the palestine statehood recognition no bill table last week by my hon friend the member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran finally will the foreign secretary tell we what recent update he have have from the israeli government on the prospect of the return of the hostage they have be hold in captivity by hamas for more than year know the whole house will agree that their return remain priority no uk troop be involve in the action by israel few night ago the hon gentleman raise the irgc reassure he that the home secretary be conduct state threat review at this time and that the irgc be keep in mind in relation to those concern remind the hon gentleman that we have sanction settler since come into office be on the west bank remain hugely concerned at the loss of life this year the scale of the violence and the scale of the expansion of which there have be more in this last year than we have see in the last be not able to support the bill on recognition but the hon gentleman will know that recognition be in the labour manifesto and we be committed to it at the right time do not think that during the conflict be the right time but we must work with partner to achieve it it be not the end in itself the end we want to see be two state solution that be what we must all hold out for member from across the house condemn and mourn the death of more than israelis as result of the october attack and we all demand the immediate release of all almost hostage still in gaza however over palestinians have be kill in gaza tragically that include well over child thousand more be fear dead under the rubble give that more than of gazan structure have be bomb to rubble how be that in any way proportionate appreciate that the incoming labour government have stop the sale of all offensive weapon that could be use in the gaza conflict however what far tangible step can my right hon friend the foreign secretary and the government take to publicly condemn and call out the netanyahu regime and help bring these horror to an end there be lot that we be do and try to do to alleviate the humanitarian suffering we provide additional funding for uk med which do within the first week in office we match fund the disasters emergency committee appeal that be million to date we be support jordan which want to do airdrop with its planning we be do everything we can to alleviate the suffering but as my hon friend know the truck be back up there be food sit on the border that come from the british taxpayer it be that that be unacceptable it be that that raise again with foreign minister katz and that we will continue to press on the aid need to get in now he reassure this weekend that it will that be his reassurance as we head into winter and the knesset voting today on unrwa the urgency of the debate we be have in this house could not be more necessary do the foreign commonwealth and development office share my view that none of this dreadful cycle which begin on october would have happen but for iran determination to derail the prospect of peace and recognition between saudi arabia and israel what assessment have the department make of the possibility that one day the iranian people will be able to free themselves of the terrible regime under which they suffer the right hon gentleman be right this story begin on october and it be important for we to keep it in mind that hamas be proxy fund and support by iran that hezbollah be proxy fund and support by iran and that the houthis who be currently cause huge disruption in the red sea be also fund and support by iran we should also keep it in mind that iran be regime that perpetrate all sort of atrocity on its own people it suppress freedom of speech it suppress woman the list go on the right hon gentleman be entirely right to place iran at the centre as the major threat to the region on saturday the un under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator say the entire population of north gaza be at risk of die she also say what israeli force be do in besiege north gaza can not be allow to continue do the foreign secretary agree and what representation have he make to the israeli government to that effect remind the israeli government that people have now be kill that more than of the population have be displace many of they repeatedly since that as we head towards winter we have be unable to ensure effective and safe distribution of aid across gaza that we need to increase the volume of the type of good that be reach gaza and we must stop restrict the aid flow and that there be responsibility under international humanitarian law to protect civilian population to minimise harm to civilian and civilian infrastructure and to ensure that aid worker can go about their business free and unfettered may return the right hon gentleman to the specific issue of iran we use to agree with each other on this matter great deal when he be in opposition so if he do not mind will probe he bit far back in the right hon gentleman and the opposition rightly call for iran not just to be sanction but to be rule out legally when it come to any action at all with all action and involvement with iran make illegal proscribe support he at that time and be not supportive of my own government give all the billion that iran have spend that could have go towards health building and quality of life but instead go towards tunnel missile and violence all over the region be it not time in the right hon gentleman mind to follow through and along with our ally proscribe iran completely and to say that this must never happen again the right hon gentleman have raise serious issue this be why the home secretary and be look far more closely at what it mean to bear down on state that be cause the activity that he have describe rather than terrorist cell that be cause it most often when we be discuss these issue in the chamber we be talk about hamas hezbollah or some terrorist cell but in this instance we be talk about state which mean that more complex issue come to bear include of course our own presence in that state and for those reason we engage in more thorough examination the foreign secretary will no doubt agree that third state such as the uk be oblige not to assist israel in its annihilation of the gazan people israel continue to target the cynically name safe and hospital in its war of extermination although the uk have suspend of licence for the export of arm to the israeli military our continued participation in the global supply chain mean that devastate lb bomb continue to destroy human being the foreign secretary rightly ask what must parent say to their child and how do they explain this living nightmare be they not right also to ask where be the international community when they need they and why be all the lever available not use to ban arm sale to use the leverage of recognition of palestine and to impose sanction to concentrate mind my hon friend will understand that we sell relatively few arm to israel think they represent of the total amount and that much of what we send be defensive in nature it be not what we describe routinely as arm because the licensing regime be about control equipment which be not always arm however we have suspend arm that could be use in israel in contravention of humanitarian law make that decision and think it be the right decision as have say we continue to do all we can to support the people of gaza and be deeply sad that and my predecessor have not be able to bring this crisis and war to an end it sadden greatly my hon friend evoke my conscience believe that be do all can accord to my conscience if as everybody expect the israeli government ignore the pleading of the foreign secretary and our ally and proceed with the dismantling of unrwa make its job impossible what will he do next will there be any consequence whatsoever for the israeli government when raise this issue with foreign minister katz yesterday he be at pain to explain that although the knesset could pass its bill today that do not mean that it have to be implement we must hope that the israeli government do not implement this legislation because it be not in their interest it can not be in their interest to prevent the only aid organisation in the region from work because unrwa provide not just healthcare but school for young people and it work not just in gaza but in the occupy territory it simply can not be in the israeli government interest to do that because they would then have to provide help themselves welcome the foreign secretary statement today and strongly support the government effort to achieve ceasefire secure the release of the remain hostage and restart the negotiation for two state solution also welcome the government decision several week ago to suspend number of arm export licence to israel where there be risk that they would be use to violate international law will my right hon friend confirm that the uk be work hard to persuade our ally particularly the united states to adopt our position on arm export to israel to ensure that no weapon be be export from any country where there be risk that they could be use to commit war crime in gaza we have one of the most robust export licensing regime in the world it be our legislation so it be not the case that have be proselytise to other country to do what we have do do it because believe that there be clear risk that international humanitarian law be be breach in relation to our legislation that be why make the decision it must be for other to reflect on their own law and rule after weekend of relentless israeli attack on besiege population in northern gaza the united nations have demand that such blatant disregard for basic humanity and for the law of war must stop add that the entire population of northern gaza be at risk of die unless the foreign secretary believe that the un be lie exaggerate or embellish the situation in northern gaza there can be no basis whatsoever for the uk to continue arm sale to israel be the un lie exaggerate or embellish the truth of what be go on in northern gaza right now the un be absolutely not embellish what be very sadly go on in gaza right now and that be why the united kingdom have suspend arm sale for use in gaza despite all the pleading the israeli government ignore request to allow aid into gaza ignore request to stop the destruction of gaza and ignore request to stop settler violence in the west bank congratulate the foreign secretary on the sanction against the settler and settler organisation engage in that violence will he now extend the sanction to member of the israeli government who have be promote violence in the west bank also do he agree that if the israeli government carry out their restriction on unrwa in formalise way member of that government who agree to that should be sanction for it otherwise be we not just issue empty threat and empty word that the israelis ignore my hon friend will know that have condemn in no uncertain term both as shadow foreign secretary and as foreign secretary some of the vile language that have be use by extremist element within the israeli government hear the former foreign secretary on the radio talk about sanction which could have be implement that he choose not to implement can assure my hon friend that be keep those sanction under review it have be hold belief across all government that two state solution be the only way to break the cycle of violence but of course after israel withdraw from gaza that pretty much lead to what happen on october can the foreign secretary use his office and the uk government to lead discussion proactively as friend to israel and key member of the united nations on what security can be put in place in two state solution use ally around to ensure that israel can have the confidence such development will not be use as an attack platform to murder so many people once more we continue to hold out for that two state solution and it be definitely the case that arab partner want to see that two state solution among they at this stage saudi arabia be very important know that israel would like to normalise relation with saudi arabia but think the hon gentleman know that that be unlikely unless there be road map to two state we continue to work with all partner to keep two state alive and of course on the security concern that israel would need to be satisfied to bring that about the current situation in northern gaza be dreadful welcome the lead role the government have play in provide essential humanitarian relief to gaza include through support package for unrwa unicef the world health organisation and other follow discussion have last week with the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend the member for lincoln hamish falconer do the foreign secretary agree that israeli restriction on the flow of essential aid be completely unacceptable and should be lift immediately yes and make that point to foreign minister katz yesterday they be unacceptable and condemn they over the past year israeli occupy force have destroy every facet of palestinian life target life home school university hospital mosque and even church in fact enact the exact word of israel defence secretary to eliminate everything will the foreign secretary now look beyond his conscience and immediately cease the provision of military support to israel suspend all export licence and impose two way arm embargo so that no more child die really accept the heartfelt way in which the hon gentleman put his question but we have suspend arm that could be use in gaza in the way he describe that be what we have do stand by that decision the situation in northern gaza be beyond desperate with many report of action that have every appearance of aim to empty the territory of its entire population the un humanitarian chief joyce msuya have warn that the entire population be at risk of die the strategy of the israeli government be intolerable and have fail on its own term because the hostage have not be release as we all want to see can the foreign secretary say what happen next what far meaningful action be the government plan to take to safeguard life in northern gaza and secure an immediate ceasefire my hon friend evoke the hostage which allow to put on record our desire to see the uk hostage emily damari free reassure my hon friend that last week at the un security council we convene meeting on humanitarian access we issue statement only yesterday with some colleague from the include japan germany and south korea urge israel to step back on the unrwa decision it be important to acknowledge that israel be often first on the scene when there be humanitarian crisis internationally and be generous even in country that do not recognise it however it must do more to ensure that aid get into gaza do the foreign secretary agree that it be not good enough for country such as ours simply to be generous which it be it must also ensure that its generosity be not divert into the hand of proxy particularly hamas and hezbollah yes the right hon gentleman be right about that we make every effort to ensure that that be not the case in this circumstance for war that have go on for year for the human suffering that be visible in gaza for the many child who be out of school and walk around in squalor it have always be the case that military effort alone would not bring this to an end only politic can do that worry greatly about those young people grow up in the year ahead with vengeance in their heart and very sadly repetition of what we have see the united nations act under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator have release statement in which she say hospital have be hit and health worker have be detain shelter have be empty and burn down first responder have be prevent from save people from under the rubble ten of thousand of people have be kill that be shocking and terrifying statement her statement go on to say the entire population of north gaza be at risk of die will the foreign secretary confirm that the uk will use its role as chair of the un security council in november to push for urgent progress on humanitarian access the protection of civilian free the hostage and bring to an end this terrible conflict wish it be the case that this war would come to an end and that we would have ceasefire before we chair the un security council next month but fear that that may not be the case reassure my hon friend that will go to new york myself to press the issue as she put they yair golan be an israeli politician who only last month attend the labour party conference and have meeting with mps include photo opportunity with the foreign secretary and the minister for the middle east the hon member for lincoln hamish falconer yair golan be the same israeli politician who late last year say in the israeli press that starve people to death be completely legitimate give that the entire population of northern gaza be on the brink of die from famine as repeatedly describe both by member here today and by the under secretary general of the united nations will the foreign secretary sanction yair golan in addition to his already state aim of consider sanction against bezalel smotrich for justify the use of starvation against palestinians as weapon of war the hon gentleman make his point effectively and those issue be be keep under review give that the government have suspend only of the arm export licence include for component critical to offensive fighter jet without which israel would be unable to conduct its genocidal assault in gaza and lebanon can the foreign secretary tell how this exemption of offensive weaponry be consistent with the united kingdom international obligation include under the arm trade treaty have the government engage in discussion with the united states government lockheed martin and other partner country on implement the tracking and tracing of manufacture component or spare part that be destine for israel but license for export to third country stand by our carve out for because there be other important theatre of conflict around the world that this house have discuss and will continue to discuss at length be not prepared to ground plane that be save life in other theatre which be why we make this decision and stand by it it be the right decision today as on other recent occasion we have hear labour member suggest that israel be somehow conduct war of annihilation extermination and genocide although we all accept that there be obviously much suffering in gaza this terminology be completely inappropriate and inaccurate and it be repeat by the protester and lawbreaker who be intimidate british jews as we see again this weekend will the foreign secretary take this opportunity to say that there be not genocide occur in the middle east these be legal term and they must be determine by international court agree with the hon gentleman that those term be largely use when million of people lose their life in crisis such as rwanda and the holocaust of the second world war the way that people be now use those term undermine their seriousness thank my right hon friend for his statement which be very welcome give how we expect the knesset to vote today to make it very difficult if not impossible for unrwa to operate with the consequence that humanitarian aid will not get into gaza be that not the point at which we have to consider serious sanction against the proponent of such action my hon friend ask very serious question as say early foreign minister katz be at pain to tell that the knesset enact this decision do not necessarily mean that it will be implement by the israeli government yes the truth be that unrwa be bring to its knee would be very serious event indeed emily damari be shoot abduct and be still in captivity she be the last british hostage hold in gaza she be literally on her own be sure the foreign secretary will join in commend mandy and her family for all their effort to get emily release one positive move we could make would be during the visit by the high level qatari delegation that be due to arrive in few week time when we have such delegation normally thing be arrange in advance so will the foreign secretary prevail on qatari official to do all they can to get hamas to release the last british hostage and all the hostage who be hold in captivity in gaza be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise mandy and emily damari who keep in the front of my mind in everything do in this arena to bring about ceasefire mandy be an amazing woman be meet with the qataris again tomorrow and of course will raise the issue welcome the foreign secretary statement to the house we have be call for ceasefire for some time but innocent civilian continue to die and to be maim in gaza the situation have get bad not well do the foreign secretary agree with that now be the time for we to do more and go far we continue to do more the good way to do that be by work with our major ally that be why we put out statement just yesterday with our ally on the humanitarian situation and on unrwa particularly when we chair the un security council next month will continue to do as much as can naturally the foreign secretary say that we need to prevent escalation in the conflict between israel and iran but as he say that conflict be be drive by iran use network of proxy in the arab world have genuine question for the foreign secretary do he understand why israel be increasingly think that it need to go after the head of the octopus rather than defend itself against the tentacle or do he think that israel should never take step to deter iran directly say with all seriousness that be pleased to have urge restraint on israel in the last few week and to have see its measured response to iran on the scale of attack it could have make on iran it rightly stick to stockpile and military site and do not progress to oil gas and nuclear site which believe would have be escalatory in nature more than people over half of whom be woman and child be estimate by the un to have be displace from lebanon into syria since september the majority of those have initially be displace by the syrian civil war in witness the dignified resilience of civilian flee the syrian conflict in the domiz refugee camp in the kurdistan region of iraq and recall that they be assist by aid from the british government and british ngos will my right hon friend confirm that the uk be provide additional support to woman and girl flee the conflict in lebanon who be as ever pay the price of war can confirm that we be support those flee lebanon into syria at this time and we recognise the fragile position that syria be in let alone what be now happen in lebanon my hon friend can definitely have that reassurance early the hon member for argyll bute and south lochaber brendan quote joyce msuya the humanitarian chief of the un who say the entire population of north gaza be at risk of die this be on top of the who die last week on top of all those live in the most desperate situation in southern gaza and on top of the occupation of southern lebanon the bombing of southern beirut and now the danger of hot war between iran and israel be it not time that instead of express concern about the humanitarian catastrophe in the region we stop supply israel with the weapon that cause the humanitarian catastrophe in the first place and suspend arm supply in total to israel in order to bring about ceasefire and cessation of this frankly murder of an innocent civilian population know the strength of feeling that my neighbour in north london have on these issue and his long stand campaigning on they assure he that we be not just wring our hand the work of uk med in hospital be hugely important and be very pleased to make further fund available to uk med upon come into office the work of the disasters emergency committee in raise further fund and the way in which the government have match fund that to the tune of million be hugely important it be great to be in jordan few week ago discuss with king abdullah his airlift into jordan and the planning that he be get from uk armed force in organise those airlift and the air bridge that he have be keen to take forward these be action real thing that we be do not just wringing of hand when the right hon member describe the situation in gaza he largely describe much that say in my statement as have say before and will say again we have suspend arm that could be use in contravention of international humanitarian law where there be clear risk accord to our export licensing regime he should be reassure that we have do that word be simply not enough to describe the devastation of gaza and the word of my right hon friend be not enough to open the border to allow humanitarian aid to flow or enough to stop the israeli government act with impunity across gaza we think particularly of the north at this time and the struggle that we hear about there what be he do to expedite the work of the international criminal court and the international court of justice and ensure that they have all the resource need to speed up their work to call these criminal who be exercise such devastation over gaza to account reassure my hon friend that meet with the chief prosecutor few week ago we continue to support the icc as she know we have be very clear on our support for the rule of law and international humanitarian law particularly both the icc and the icj should be able to go about their work unfettere by political intervention thank the foreign secretary for his statement and his tone which should be admire he rightly state the precarious situation that the middle east teeter upon while iran have seemingly dial back the rhetoric for now how will he encourage the iranians and importantly the irgc to dial back on their action not simply against israel but against their own people who be on their knee subject to brutal human right abuse and persecution in the face of this horrific regime how can we help ordinary iranians and israelis to live life free from war have emphasise my conversation with the israeli foreign minister yesterday but should also emphasise my conversation with the iranian foreign minister yesterday talk to he about restraint and our concern in relation to the support for proxy and raise the nuclear question and the snapback clause that come into play next year if we be not able to progress with partner our further conversation with iran as the foreign secretary know this be critical time for the middle east think the house speak as one with message of end the violence release the hostage and get aid in the humanitarian crisis face the palestinian people will only be make bad if the israeli government carry out their threat to effectively shut down unrwa although welcome the government utter condemnation and rejection of those plan what reassurance can he give my constituent and the house that the government will not only talk tough in the region but take action to protect life if the israeli government persist with those plan my hon friend be right to raise unrwa that be why the government restore funding to unrwa it be why we give it furth million and it be why million of that funding be use to help it to implement madame colonna reform it would be catastrophe to see the end of unrwa and it would be wholly counterproductive for israel by the way the situation in the occupy territory be fragile as it be to take away unrwa would be catastrophic for all those reason have urge the israeli government to step back and not implement what have pass through the knesset year ago despite the undoubted challenge there be early sign of improve relation between israel the gulf state and other that be press israel to move towards the two state solution that we in this house would all like to see the iranian regime however through its own action and those of its proxy have succeed in engulf the region in chaos and conflict cause many of the disaster we have hear about this afternoon what be be do in partnership with our gulf state ally to counter that activity and bring stability and the prospect of regional peace back to the area be in jordan few week ago speak with king abdullah and my jordanian counterpart about their air bridge proposal and the planning we have help they with to ensure they can at least drop aid into gaza on the effort to bring about hostage and ceasefire deal have be speak to the qataris and the egyptians particularly give their relation with or route into hamas we continue to speak to the saudis and other in the region to try to bring about that peace have no doubt that arab partner want to play role in that peace but they will be able to do so only if there be proper path towards two state solution my right hon friend will be aware of the grow concern include among organisation such as medical aid for palestinians and action for humanity that israel may attempt to illegally annex northern gaza have the uk government raise those concern with the israeli government and what action will the uk government take should those concern become reality have raise those concern such action would be illegal and wrong and the uk government would view it with the seriousness that it deserve have be contact by constituent who be increasingly distressed about the scene in gaza and there be grow concern about the rapidly deteriorating and utterly appalling situation in the north of gaza urge the foreign secretary to ensure that the government be use every measure available include work with our international partner to get resolution to the situation and prioritise get humanitarian aid and medical relief into gaza particularly the north thank my hon friend for raise the work of our international partner which be so important that be why few week ago join the canadian foreign minister mélanie joly in speak to the israelis and it be also why go to israel with my french colleague to speak to the israelis time and again work in co ordinate way with ally produce great effect iran monstrous state sponsorship of hamas hezbollah and the houthis be fundamental driver of the conflict we see in gaza lebanon and the red sea respectively can my right hon friend confirm what step the government be take to undermine iran financial military and logistical support for those terrorist proxy can assure my hon friend that since come into office we have introduce three batch of sanction against iran over national be now under uk sanction thank the foreign secretary for his statement the humanitarian situation in gaza be catastrophic so can he please update the house on the work that the government be do to provide more aid and to ensure that it get to those who need it my hon friend be right the humanitarian situation be dire that be why be at pain to emphasise what we be do it be important that we lead the way on get the pause so that child could be vaccinate against polio be very distressed to see that pause break just few day ago and we be urge for it to be resume once more so that those child can get their second vaccination dose that be why the work of uk med be very important it be why the current dec appeal be also very important and it be why we will continue to support people who be sick and injure to be evacuate from the area the suffering of the people of palestine and northern gaza be truly horrific every day child be not just be bomb they be be starve that be not the kind of treatment we would expect for our child let alone any other country child so do the foreign secretary agree that it be time israel cease use food hunger and siege as weapon of war all contrary to international law and for it to be give that message loud and clear by this house my hon friend be absolutely right he will recall that when suspend sale of arm that could be use in gaza the criterion under our regime be clear risk that there could be breach of international humanitarian law when be look at the assessment keep come back to humanitarian access as the clear risk so my hon friend be right we have tremendous concern about the inability to get aid in the restriction that israel be put in place and the man make starvation that be now come about as result that bring that statement to an end we will take few moment while the front benchers swap over remind member that if they wish to contribute during statement or urgent question they need to be in the chamber for the opening statement fiscal rules with your permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement to the house about the action the chancellor will take this week to fix the foundation and rebuild britain economic growth and modern public service can only be build on strong foundation that be why this government have bring political and economic stability back to britain after year of chaos from the conservative party chaos that cost family business and public service dear the british people be now rightly look to this new labour government to clear up the mess from the last government fix the foundation and rebuild britain that be the change that my party promise the country and it be the change that we will deliver to deliver that change the fiscal rule that the chancellor will set out this week will establish the basis for stable fiscal policy mean careful management of day to day spending and responsible long term plan to invest and grow the economy as we commit to in our manifesto the government will have two robust fiscal rule that will guide the decision we take the first be our stability rule we will pay for all day to day spending on public service from receipt the current budget be last in surplus under the last labour government and this labour government will return the public finance to that report may vol correction the second be our investment rule which will get debt fall as proportion of our economy it will ensure that we can secure the investment that our economy need to grow and to generate job and opportunity for people across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland while maintain strong fiscal anchor and ensure that our debt burden fall over time the plan that we inherit from the last government would have see public sector investment decline to the low level in more than year the path of decline investment be the path of decline nation and we refuse to follow it instead we will seize the huge opportunity of the future to support the enterprise and talent that this country create the government recognise that sustain public investment be crucial driver of long term economic growth give the private sector the confidence to invest too but our ambition for public sector investment must be balance against the need to maintain debt on sustainable trajectory and ensure that we invest every pound of taxpayer money responsibly that be why will deliver year national infrastructure strategy next spring work with colleague across government the nation and region and with our mayor and the private sector to set out robust long term strategy for sound investment that be also why our new approach to overlap multi year spending review will improve the way that we allocate and spend capital and why the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and will lead the new national infrastructure and service transformation authority which will drive well delivery of major project and infrastructure across the country in addition there will be the work of the new office for value for money and the national audit office those robust guardrail will ensure that our capital spending be value for money and that our financial investment deliver positive return for the exchequer finally the chancellor have be listen to the view of institution such as the international monetary fund and to expert economist as she have set out that be why the treasury have be review the right measure of debt to target in the fiscal rule ahead of the upcoming budget the detail of that policy will be announce to the house in the chancellor statement on wednesday alongside an economic and fiscal forecast produce by the independent office for budget responsibility in the usual way the fiscal rule will be publish in draft charter for budget responsibility on which member will vote in due course commend this statement to the house call the shadow exchequer secretary to the treasury wonder whether the chancellor announcement of change to the fiscal rule would survive the weekend give the five fictitious freeport that come and go it be cautionary tale about the uncertainty and confusion that can be create when policy be not announce in the proper way in parliament welcome the delay statement by the chief secretary to the treasury and be grateful for advance sight of it make billion announcement at an overseas conference and not at fiscal event in this house have understandably and notably move market create further uncertainty for an already nervous business community although the chancellor announce change last week she do not provide any detail about what that change would be common approach by labour that be now come back to bite they as the reality of government set in the prime minister have admit as much in recent day speak of the need to embrace fiscal reality by adopt measure that be never list in labour manifesto in fact the chancellor explicitly say before the election that she would not change the fiscal rule because that would be to fiddle the figure by go ahead with this late turn and broken promise she have compromise trust and credibility ahead of her first budget that join the long list of promise already break by the labour government in such short time the promise to cut energy bill by break the promise that their manifesto be fully cost broken the promise to be on the side of pensioner so obviously break and we know that their promise not to raise taxis on work people be about to be break too try as they might to sell different story just like government bond right now people ai buy it we be leave in the ludicrous position in which the uk the sixth large economy in the world do not have an operative definition of public debt quite understandably market have respond to this late uncertainty by apply premium to uk sovereign debt at time when they have be discount the sovereign debt of our international peer the market be also perplex as to why these change be announce without an accompany obr report in the word of the chancellor never have government borrow so much and explain so little official report september vol the government may think that this will all go unnoticed and that most people do not know enough about the fiscal rule to know what be really go on here but let be very clear the people will know about this they will know it and feel it when interest rate stay high for long treasury advice to we be consistently clear interest rate would stay high if the rule be change what advice do treasury official give the chief secretary to the treasury about the impact on interest rate do he agree with paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies who say that the change will mean more debt more debt interest and that it be no free lunch of course we all want to see investment in our public service and infrastructure we oversee the large ever increase in funding for the nhs we increase defence spending to the high level since the cold war and we attract the second great foreign direct investment in the world but we seek that investment with view to boost productivity by invest in technology that approach have now be scrap by labour and spread opportunity around this country through freeport and investment zone this labour government be quick to spend but unwilling to explain finally on behalf of the british people and the market which be watch this statement so very nervously ask the chief secretary to the treasury what definition of public debt be the uk offering to lender today and how much do the government plan to borrow under an expand definition he will say that we have to wait for the budget but the chancellor do not wait last week so why should we be very fond of the hon gentleman but he have some brass neck to stand up in this house and tell this government how to behave after his party maladministration over the last year may politely point out that he might be get slightly ahead of himself the chancellor have not set out the detail of the fiscal rule in advance of the budget she will do it in this house in the budget on wednesday and encourage he to wait for that information he paint picture of the country perform so well under his party leadership but he may want to reflect on why he lose the last election so badly as chair of the treasury committee which have responsibility for scrutinise the budget find the timing of this statement bit frustrating as we will have question that presumably can not be answer until wednesday will the chief secretary explain how the guardrail will work there be the national infrastructure and service transformation authority the office for value for money and the national audit office what role will each play in reassure the market so that an autumn be psnfl or public sector net financial liability do not become winter cold know that the chancellor look forward to give evidence to the treasury committee follow the budget in the normal way to answer the question the national infrastructure strategy will for the first time bring together all the infrastructure and major project ask of whitehall departments into one place alongside the economic infrastructure assessment this will inform the multi year spending review which will now overlap so that when an election come up we do not again end up with government make no spending plan whatsoever or announce load of project when there be no money to pay for they we be confident that this well approach to allocate capital will mean that investment under this government will improve the productivity of our public service and the growth of our economy and mean well return for british taxpayer across the country call the liberal democrat spokesperson under the conservatives the fiscal rule change five time in seven year so change to fiscal rule be not that unusual in and of itself however do the minister agree that what would be completely unforgivable be repeat of the conservatives disastrous mini budget in which they try to pursue billion of unfunded tax cut and which leave long shadow on our public finance will he assure we that any additional borrowing that the government seek will only be for productive investment that will generate growth and fix our crumble hospital and school thank the hon lady for her question and share she continue anger about the behaviour of the last conservative government because as she and the whole house will know our constituent be still pay the price of that government chaos and failure that be why the first act of this labour government the first act that take through this house be the budget responsibility act which lock in the power of the office for budget responsibility to hold this government and future government to account if we ever again end up in position where conservative ministers decide to ignore independent check and balance the obr would be able to report its view to this house independently so that parliament could hold that future government to account end by point to our first fiscal rule which be that we will pay for day to day spending with receipt again that mean that we will not end up in the situation that we be in under the last government when month after month borrow just pay the bill for which they do not put money aside fiscal rule be tool for responsibility and we should all welcome rule that help we to act responsibly and invest responsibly the rule and the accounting definition that underlie they be not matter of faith preordain by the almighty and pass to we on stone tablet they be there to help we make responsible decision do my right hon friend agree with and with the former chief economist of the bank of england the oecd the international monetary fund and george osborne former treasury minister that we should welcome change to the fiscal rule that promote investment will avoid the suggestion that we might go back to put thing on stone tablet if may but will accept the invitation in my hon friend question and say that after year we have see the failure of the approach take by the last government note in my statement that public sector investment would now have be at its low in year under the plan of the now opposition that have be failure for the economy and for the british people and this government will rectify it before the election the chancellor say that she would not change the measure of debt in order to borrow more but now she be talk about do exactly that before the election she say that she would not increase national insurance but now she be talk about do exactly that before the election labour steer people away from the idea that the government would cut the winter fuel payment but they have already do exactly that they say before the election that they would not increase taxis on work people but now they be plan to do exactly that do the minister understand why so many of my constituent feel that they be mislead the hon member constituent will note at the budget on wednesday that this party honour its promise the promise set out in its manifesto to protect work people he might want to reflect on the way that his party fail his constituent at the last election before try to lecture this government welcome measure that allow for more long term investment to improve our economic performance and public service but would like my right hon friend to address two issue be housing one of the area where more investment might be allow to help we achieve our target of million more home in this parliament secondly will he ensure that where there be public investment we try to make that investment produce order for uk company rather than many of the order go abroad that be the way to create real growth in our economy we make commitment to deliver million home and we will do just that on the second part of the question the whole purpose of the national infrastructure strategy and the overlapping multi year spending review be to give investor and supplier confidence that when the government say something will be deliver it will so they can invest and plan on that basis to help improve the british economy frankly they be start from position of complete dismay because of the fail promise of the last government we will rectify that if we could stick with the here and now what the chancellor announce cause the bond market to move almost immediately by almost that mean that interest rate will stay high for long will the right hon gentleman confirm that that will cause hardship to today mortgage payer and tomorrow generation of taxpayer because they will have to repay this extra debt what can confirm be that what affect interest rate and mortgage payment so severely be the chaotic behaviour of the hon gentleman party in government before the last election that be why we have have to legislate to make sure that if they ever return to government they could not behave in similar way we be take responsible approach to public spending as have set out today and we will never return to the activity of his party in government there appear to be some confusion among those on the opposition benches when talk about their track record and about the record they have break on the relationship between the nominal and the real on the point about be realistic do the minister agree that in our reform of the fiscal rule we must unlike the last government provide that realism and stability and ensure that wild unfunded commitment such as the abolition of national insurance do not occur my hon friend point rightly to the billion black hole that we be have to clear up after the tory party in the budget on wednesday the chancellor will set out how we be reset public finance and fix the foundation so that we can get on and deliver our manifesto in outline term we welcome what the government be seek to do it be important to raise the ability to generate capital infrastructure investment scotland invest more than the uk average and the uk average be low than the oecd average that issue be priority but the government move will fall on stony ground if on wednesday the chancellor continue with her priority to not lift people out of poverty and to go by exception after small business that take an income from that business by raise the cost of employment with the four signal capital investment project all be in england be move to ask what in this for scotland be delighted to hear the hon gentleman tell the house that he welcome the positive change that this labour government in westminster be deliver to the scottish people agree with he on early announcement can point to gb energy and the huge commitment we have make on energy infrastructure which we know will be important to the scottish people we absolutely recognise that the scottish economy have huge contribution to make to the whole economy of great britain and northern ireland and we look forward to work with the scottish people to make that reality commend my right hon friend on his work on stability and investment would he like to say little more about the challenge inheritance he have receive from the previous government and just how dreadful that have actually be welcome my hon friend question interruption know that opposition member find it uncomfortable but it be matter of fact that we will return to time and time again because the sheer truth of it be that the last government make promise after promise to the british people know that they do not have the money to pay the bill it be shameful and the soon they come to the house and apologise for their behaviour the well it might be for they in the long run if the minister be so confident in his fiscal rule will he take this opportunity to commit to the house that the year gilt yield in this parliament will not exceed the maximum it be over the past year the hon gentleman be try to be clever but he be invite to speculate on the budget he will have to wait until wednesday do the minister agree that sustainable growth can not come from short termism and that the fall in public sector investment plan under the last government would have exacerbate rather than ameliorate the economic chaos they get we into my hon friend be right we have choice at this budget either to continue with the fail policy of the previous government or to change they the british people will not be surprised that our decision be to change they reflect on the fact that the cut in investment under the previous government have lead to poor productivity in public service and lack of growth in the economy that serve nobody this statement speak of give the private sector the confidence to invest can the minister explain to the small business in my constituency how it will give they confidence if the first act of this government be to soak they with further national insurance increase will that not dent confidence rather than increase it along with sustained high interest rate when he speak about multi year spending review do that mean that he now expect the devolved government to produce multi year budget which be something that the stormont government have be reluctant to do obviously can not speculate on the budget so invite the hon gentleman to come back to the house on wednesday for the answer to the first part of his question on the second part he might know that lead for the government on our relationship with the devolved government have meet finance ministers from scotland wales and northern ireland most recently in belfast where we have productive meeting they be all very clear that the reset in the relationship between they and the westminster government be positive give the fail relationship of the past we make some progress in that meeting and we will make further such progress in the budget be it not clear that the rule economic orthodoxy have let this country down over many year how else can we explain the fact that in of the last year the uk spend less on investment than any other country in particular in post industrial area like mine the investment simply do not come encourage the minister to break with the prevail orthodoxy and ensure that we achieve the appropriate investment level and direct that investment particularly to the north the midland and elsewhere my hon friend have invite to answer the question why be there investment over the last decade or so quite frankly it be because of the choice of the conservative party this labour party in government be take different set of decision and we will set out the detail on wednesday first declare my interest as governor of the royal berkshire hospital and have family member who be shareholder in health company as lord darzi say the conservatives have fail to provide proper capital funding for our nhs thank the secretary of state for health and social care and the minister for secondary care for their engagement with and other mp on the review of the new hospital programme will the chief secretary to the treasury guarantee that the change to the fiscal rule will mean that my constituent can see new and immediate funding for the royal berkshire hospital the hon member ask so politely but he will know that can not guarantee anything in advance of the budget however it sound as though he have already experience the positive way in which this government be approach how we will repair the nhs and get it back on its foot both by get junior doctor off the strike line and back into ward and by invest in hospital for the future know that he will look forward to the announcement in the budget on wednesday before become an mp lead service for very vulnerable people and unfortunately come into close contact with gaslighting as new mp be afraid that my contact with gaslighting be not diminish and slightly despair at what be see from opposition members while be out canvass over the weekend and talk with resident on ken road in southbourne meet constituent who say we know it be go to be pretty and you be go to inherit mess and we know that it would be long haul to get thing right but we be sick and tired of politician who be take the big decision and invest in the long term do my right hon friend agree that we should listen to more of our constituent like the person just mention who happen to vote labour on july for the first time in her life thank my hon friend and thank his constituent for put her trust in this labour government as the prime minister say today this government will run towards the problem as oppose to run away from they as the conservative party do that will mean difficult decision at the budget on wednesday to deal with the mess that we inherit to reset public finance and to be able to start to deliver our manifesto but this government will take those decision and we will announce the detail on wednesday thank the minister for his statement want to ask what the legacy of this will be will he far outline how the change to the fiscal rule to allow for more efficient borrowing will not simply pass more debt on to for example my six lovely grandchild and everybody else grandchild who already face scale back welfare system and increase cost of live before they even earn their first pay cheque how will the minister so call guardrail not simply be barrier to future generation own their own home and make end meet be think of the one who come after thank the hon member for his question he and his constituent will know as much as mine do that the problem for this country before the election be that the last government have to borrow each month to pay for bill that they do not have the money to pay for and that they make whole list of promise across the country that they know they could not pay for that be why we have the billion black hole and why our first fiscal rule be that day to day spending will be pay for from tax receipt by the exchequer we will put the public budget back into surplus so that we be not in doom loop of borrowing and borrow just to keep ahead of ourselves each month where the government do borrow we will do so for productive investment to modernise our public service and to get growth back into our economy new research publish this month by the institute for fiscal studies show that reverse the two child benefit cap would lift child above the absolute poverty line there be no fiscal rule only fiscal choice while taskforce meet more and more child in coventry south and across the country be consign to avoidable poverty will the government acknowledge that prioritise end child poverty and finally scrap the pernicious two child benefit cap share my hon friend commitment to want to tackle child poverty in this country this party have proud record on that when we be in government previously that be why we have set up the child poverty taskforce which report last week and our ambition be to reduce child poverty over the course of this parliament we will set out further measure in the budget on wednesday on how we intend to deliver that thank the minister for his statement resident and business in my constituency absolutely share our ambition to get the country back on track and acknowledge that the mission lead focus of the government and the fiscal rule be at the core of that they contrast that with year of drift under the conservatives punctuate only by day of utter chaos however resident and business in my area want to be reassure that they can be confident about our level of ambition so will the minister update we on how investor be respond to our focus and the maturity that we bring to the debate around the economy point my hon friend to our very successful international investment summit only couple of week ago when it be very clear from investor that bring stability back to our politic and our economy have be long want that be why we be able to commit to billion of investment in the country at the summit follow by another billion of investment announce only few day after we intend to raise much more to invest in this country and to bring growth back to the economy constituent in milton keynes vote for change because they see the consequence of the conservative economic policy they be suffer from the cost of live crisis and have see this in their crumble school the lack of gp appointment and the use of food bank just to make end meet will the chief secretary reassure and my constituent that we will end the conservative use of payday loan just to keep the light on and instead invest in new school new hospital and new infrastructure alongside make work pay so that my constituent see their life improve with my hon friend reference to payday loan she point to the behaviour of the previous government as have tell the house this afternoon this government with their first fiscal rule will take we to place where we be not borrow to pay the bill each month as have happen for year under the conservatives anyone manage their family finance at home know that that be the right thing to do and they will welcome the fact that this government be bring that sense of discipline back to the national economy too will my right hon friend confirm that as part of their fiscal strategy and within the fiscal rule the government will utilise the national wealth fund to lever in private investment along with public investment from the taxpayer for key area of growth in our economy include for example renewable infrastructure which be of such importance in scotland my hon friend know that the test of good government be whether they can secure private sector investment to come alongside they something that decline under the last government that be why the national wealth fund which the chancellor have announce will secure billion of pound of private sector investment alongside public sector investment in the industry of the future do the minister agree that the previous government failure to invest not only damage economic growth but lead to damage to our public service with broken nhs special educational need in crisis and local government on the brink my hon friend will know from speak to his constituent during his campaign to be elect and since that people experience of public service across the country show the fact of the matter after year of failure from the conservatives our public service be on their knee that be why they need government who will bring stability back to our economy invest in public service and improve outcome for people who rely on they and work in they follow the disastrous mini budget the bank of england be force to undertake emergency liquidity operation to reduce volatility in market do my right hon friend agree that the investment summit record billion show that this government be create stable condition for long term investment after year of political chaos from the conservative party thank my hon friend for his excellent question and agree that billion invest in this country be sign of confidence because investor around the world know that britain be back after year of chaos it be good to hear about change to address the big problem with our macroeconomic framework the bias against new investment spending may draw the chief secretary attention to the other problem with the system which act as an incentive for ministers not to manage well the asset that they already hold refer he to the sale of billion worth of student loan for just billion will he reassure the house that the change that he be make will ensure that we get value for money for the exist financial asset that we hold can give my hon friend that reassurance and point to the office for value for money which will work for we to ensure that we improve on behaviour of the past also point more broadly to the way that we manage our current asset people have only to look at the state of our prison hospital and school with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and roof fall in to know that after year of cut to investment we can not carry on like that that be why people vote for change at the last election and why we will deliver it international engagement with permission will make statement on the late action that we be take to reconnect britain to the world for our security and prosperity follow official visit that have span the globe from south sudan to indonesia and the un general assembly in new york in speech at chatham house last week set out my vision for modernise international development underline to our partner at home and around the world that britain be back and that we be guide by that same realistic approach to achieve truly progressive end that inspire both ernest bevin and robin cook in today very different world first and foremost we be commit to work with other in spirit of genuine partnership and respect that will include work with other to reform the global multilateral system so that it innovate work for everyone and be fit for the future we will also work with other to ensure that the uk formidable expertise and idea be at the heart of reliable development partnership we

prioritise focus on economic development young people employment woman economic empowerment which be so often the key to growth and action on the climate and nature crisis that be what our commonwealth friend be say that they want to see in the future we will stand with they on that because it be to the mutual benefit of we all the hon lady ask about the budget the uk government position be very clear we do not want return to the kind of turbulence that we see over the past year very sadly we see in donor refugee cost in particular rise in way that be completely uncontrolle with programme cut in half that be not the current uk government approach we will ensure we have properly plan approach to international development because fail to do that be to let down our international partner the hon lady ask about our position on the un security council we have be very clear that we need to ensure there be well representation of global south partner but we will always take our leadership responsibility on the unsc very very seriously indeed we have be do that since come into government the hon lady ask about myanmar and abuse of human right again we have be very clear on the need for action to be take we have communicate that many time we be very concerned about the position of those who have be impact the hon lady ask specifically about language in the communiqué that be agree at the conference about reparative justice just to be crystal clear be sure everyone in the house would agree that the slave trade be abhorrent we condemn it just as previous labour government have do as the prime minister make clear in samoa it be important that we start from there but it be also important that we be just as clear that there have be no change in our policy on reparation the uk do not pay reparation really could not say that more emphatically and know she be aware that that be the position of the uk government finally the hon lady ask about ida will finish on that madam deputy speaker the previous government be not clear about their approach to ida replenishment the new government have be clear the prime minister say at the un general

my hon friend for raise this issue ida be critical part of the world bank architecture it be the fund that be focus on the very poor country that be most in need of support but also those which can grow very quickly when they receive that support economically it be extremely good value every invest in it result in to for those in the poor country the uk have be clear as mention that we will increase our contribution we be urge other to do the same denmark and spain say that they would do just that which think be vote of confidence in ida call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of her statement as set out during the second reading of the commonwealth parliamentary association and international committee of the red cross status bill last week the commonwealth be vitally important multilateral organisation and we support work to strengthen it the minister reference the new government approach on international development it be on this particular issue that hope she will set out further detail we welcome the reference to the sustainable development goal in her speech at chatham house last week regrettably the labour manifesto do not mention the sdg will the minister affirm that the sdg be at the heart of the uk development vision on development it be vital that we honour our international commitment and to that end restore the of gni target for international development spending that cause be champion in particular by those on the liberal democrat benches as it be the liberal democrats who enshrine the in law this be the mean to reset britain place in the world we be an international development superpower we have be miss on the world stage and into the space we have vacate other foreign actor have move in who be often at odd with british interest the minister reference the disasters emergency committee middle east appeal she will be aware that the british public have already raise million and that the uk government will match only up to million that be direct consequence of the cut to the development budget the uk government be no long able to match the generosity of the british people we now hear report that at moment when million of civilian across the world be catch in conflict uk oda be to be cut even far from to of gni such move would be deeply disappointing and ensure that the uk hand be far tie when it come to respond to humanitarian disaster will the minister rule that out suspect that the hon lady have many thing to do with her time and the labour manifesto for the general election may not be her first priority as bedtime read but let gently encourage she to look at it because she would see that it do refer to the sustainable development goal certainly agree with she that we have not see the progress that we need to see believe we have see about of the progress that we need to see with the goal to which target be attach but the government be determined to play our part in ensure that we make fast progress have discuss the matter with amina mohammed the deputy secretary general of the united nations on number of occasion include last week in washington we be determined to work with other to play our part the hon lady ask about the policy of devote of gni to overseas development assistance as she will see that too be in the labour manifesto it be our policy when fiscal circumstance allow and rightly so she say that in the past the uk have be view as an international development superpower but perhaps it be not today have to say that wherever have be in the world british people have be engage in ensure that we be play our part as nation in support other we need to harness that expertise and provide leadership again and that be exactly what this new government have be do as for the dec let say very briefly that accord to my understanding none of the last few appeal have be fully match they have always be peg at certain level think that be commensurate with how previous dec appeal have work but it may be worth check that out hope that have cover most of the hon lady point for which be grateful next year will mark year since the gleneagles summit when leader agree to an ambitious debt cancellation deal under the previous labour government at present however the unfair debt burden be hold back many develop country include some in the commonwealth what discussion have the minister have on this important issue and what be our plan my hon friend have considerable expertise in this area as do many member among the new intake as well as those who be here before it be important for the uk to exercise leadership on these issue just as we do under past labour government my hon friend should be aware that we be work very hard to make sure that we do all we can to support country to deal with this issue member of the paris club and the for instance be seek to cement and accelerate those effort because overall the debt level be have very negative impact on country ability to provide health and education service may ask the minister about another of the foreign secretary recent visit to the republic of korea do she agree that the agreement to strengthen the defence and security dialogue with south korea be very welcome as be the condemnation of the support from the democratic people republic of korea both with weapon and now with troop for russia in its illegal invasion of ukraine do she also agree that now be the time when south korea should step up its support for ukraine and drop its previous reluctance to supply it with weapon be very grateful for that important question and be pleased to report that relation between the uk and the republic of korea be at their close ever at the moment the downing street accord between the uk and the republic of korea elevate our relationship to global strategic partnership place the uk as second only to the us in term of the strength of our bilateral partnership the right hon gentleman be right to focus on the need to condemn the dprk engagement in ukraine and indeed the uk government have take the same approach should add that decision about south korea activity relate to its military be of course for south korea itself but we be determined to work closely with it on this and many other issue declare an interest in that before be elect to represent the people of hemel hempstead work for the fairtrade foundation the minister will be aware through her own support for fair trade of the vital role that the foundation play in support smallholder farmer but of course there be million of smallholder farmer around the world should be grateful if she could update the house on the way in which the government through the world bank be support smallholder farmer and sustainable agriculture be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue he be right it be an issue of which not only uk farmer and agriculture expert in our university but the british public be deeply supportive and the government be determined to do what we can to support sustainable agriculture we see for example very little climate finance go into that arena more of it should be go there which be why the uk be work with the us and indeed announce support for joint initiative last week at the world bank annual meeting when one group of people have do something terrible to another group of people it be understandable that resentment about it can pass down to the next generation and possibly the generation after that but do the minister agree that to suggest that that process can continue over two century and thus require guilt to be expiate in the form of reparation be to make nonsense of the concept of individual responsibility the government view be that we have to focus on the future and that be the approach that we take at the chogm meeting we think it be important to listen carefully to our commonwealth partner and we have hear their call for more action to deliver the job that be need particularly for young people and for more action on climate and nature give the crisis in both those area we will continue to work with our commonwealth friend on these issue welcome the minister repeat reference to tackle both the climate and the nature crisis in the context of the prime minister recent attendance at chogm we know that many commonwealth country be among those most expose to climate change and that that have particular impact on small island state such as samoa will the minister outline in more detail the work that the government be do to put climate at the heart of our foreign and development policy be grateful to my hon friend for raise such an important issue there be indeed many small island develop state among the commonwealth state and for they the climate crisis be an existential issue we have see severe impact on number of small island develop state with extreme weather and erosion have huge effect on people security and their livelihood under the new government the uk be determined to exercise leadership on this issue and that have include range of measure will not go through they now but one critical element be ensure that there be support for adaptation as well as for mitigation these small state really need to be help to adapt to the new weather system that we be see and the uk government be do all that they can to ensure that that happen can the minister comment far on paragraph of the commonwealth heads of government statement to which the prime minister put his name it state that the heads of government note call for discussion on reparatory justice agree that the time have come for meaningful truthful and respectful conversation towards forge common future base on equity base on equity be the language normally use by those seek compensation can the minister explain what it mean in plain english do it mean part with taxpayer money and if not what do this statement mean do state early but will restate for the hon member benefit that we have be very clear about the fact that uk do not pay reparation he refer to specific element in the communiqué about reparatory justice it do two thing as he mention it note call for discussion and it agree that this be the time for conversation as the prime minister have make clear in samoa for instance none of the uk government discussion have be about money our position as have say be very clear we do not pay reparation really do not know how many time have to say that very much welcome my right hon friend statement this afternoon do she agree that the good path to global growth and prosperity be one that include woman and girl will she set out how the government and the world bank intend to achieve that be grateful to my hon friend for raise that important subject globally an enormous amount of growth could be unlock by increase woman economic opportunity the world bank have estimate that about could be add to global gdp if woman be able to work more and their pay be more reflective of man pay the uk government have be work closely on this issue with many partner include the world bank we be very pleased to be see progress particularly around support woman entrepreneur and ensure that woman economic empowerment be view as the ticket to progress and prosperity that it so often can be thank the minister for advance sight of her statement want to raise couple of point first it be only few year ago that the foreign secretary say we do just want an apology we want reparation and compensation last week however the prime minister could not even bring himself to make formal apology so hope the minister can bring herself to do so today secondly the minister say that at home and around the world britain be back there be two reason for that first there be reduction in oda spend to of gni and secondly there be the merger of the department for international development which be in east kilbride in scotland will there be return to separate department and how soon do she predict that we will return to spend of gni the hon gentleman ask number of question and will try to cover they as quickly as can the new government be very clear that the slave trade be abhorrent we condemn it just as previous labour governments do it be important that we start from there but it be also important that we be just as clear that there have be no change in our policy on reparation the uk do not pay reparation we have be very clear about that the hon gentleman talk about other country confidence in the uk leadership on international development we have to renew that confidence which be about ensure that we make number of change as set out at chatham house the week before last that include ensure that we work even more closely with brit who be lead development in different country around the world but also that we have genuine partnership with other country can not end my response to the hon gentleman without thank the terrific staff in east kilbride who do wonderful job on international development and on foreign policy more broadly take my hat off to they as new minister have be very impressed by all those work on these issue for the uk government the pandemic rise interest rate and rise wheat and energy price after putin invasion of ukraine have lead to debt crisis in low income nation some african nation spend more on service their debt than they do on healthcare use to work in one of the world poor nation somaliland have see what grind poverty can do the horror of climate change be lead to drought hunger and death will the minister consider repeat one of the proud action of the last labour government by act to end the debt crisis and by do so help to end extreme poverty once and for all be very grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue and for his passion in do so he be absolutely right many country have to pay substantial amount on service debt at the same time as have to deal with repeat crisis not least the nature and climate crisis but also crise derive from conflict so we need to show leadership on these issue that be why we be work with the rest of the on their framework it need to be fast and strong and it need to work well we will play our part in try to ensure that and we will work with the paris club on this agenda too on reparation will the minister accept that there be clear difference between the prime minister commendably robust language before he leave for samoa and the language that he eventually sign up to in paragraph of the communiqué will she accept that heads of government who be watch this process be perfectly entitle to deduce that the uk be now on journey that will lead to reparation will she far accept that there be clear difference between provide compensation to people who have be harm by the state from tainted blood victim to sub postmaster and pay reparation in respect of event that happen year ago have to say that find the right hon gentleman question rather surprising do not believe that heads of government be in any doubt about the new uk government approach to these question indeed the new government the foreign secretary the prime minister and the ministerial team have have more engagement with heads of government and our friend in the commonwealth than we have see for very long time that engagement be clear and our message be very clear indeed as say the prime minister himself have articulate that include in samoa he make it clear that none of the uk government discussion have be about money and our position be very clear we do not pay reparation as explain during my statement the focus of conversation at chogm be the fact that we need to act together on the climate crisis and

year when the hon gentleman constituent take part in that activity they be join global movement in which the foreign secretary himself be engage with young people in samoa it be about ensure that we all play our part in remove plastic pollution the hon gentleman ask about the prospect for global agreement we all want to see that happen through the un but the fact that the commonwealth come together in samoa to agree on it be very exciting it show that there be strong prospect of make headway on this very important issue thank the minister for her statement can only respect the breadth of it be pleased to hear about the focus on use international development to reduce violence against woman and girl which we all fully support at reception last week we hear personal testimony from people who have be persecute because of their religious belief do the minister feel that the overseas development budget can also be use to reduce violence against religious minority be grateful to my hon friend for raise that subject which be of much concern to many member across the house unfortunately the freedom of religion and belief be value that be be challenge across the world and we be see too many country slip backwards the new uk government be determined to do what we can to exercise leadership in international development which include support those who be subject to persecution and

more action less than of climate finance for example go into adaptation with only tiny fragment go into fragile and conflict affect state the uk be determined to exercise leadership and the new

gentleman be right of course on support service for veteran who need they there be not just what the government can help provide include on mental health through op courage but what be provide by network of first class local charity if one vision play part in that in his area of cumbria certainly pay tribute to it there be more profound reason for our concern to provide support for our veteran we need to recognise that those on deployment in the armed force must have the confidence to act decisively on behalf of the nation and they can be motivate and have their confidence reinforce by how they see the nation support veteran back home that be why we pledge in our manifesto in july to improve access to support for our veteran include on mental health employment and housing it be why we have commit to put the armed force covenant fully into law it be why within three month of take office we have deliver on the commitment to make the veteran identity card an accepted form of voter id and why the prime minister in his first conference speech announce that veteran would be exempt from rule require connection to the area from those seek to access housing there at the heart of our national security will always be the man and woman who serve this country as we consider this debate we have an opportunity to reflect on what we mean by remembrance and to recognise the immense contribution make to this country by our veteran by serve member of the armed force and by the family who support they hundred of thousand have answer the nation call and give their life in do so we honour they and we will remember they call the shadow minister join the secretary of state in congratulate our brilliant royal marines on their anniversary this timely and important debate coincide with mr speaker official opening of the constituency garden of remembrance early today it mark the point where as house we pay tribute to all those who serve and have serve our country particularly those who pay the ultimate sacrifice as we approach remembrance day thank the royal british legion and charity across the uk that ensure that our collective memory of the fall never fade while provide invaluable service and support to today veteran be also proud of the previous government record on veteran which my colleague the shadow veterans minister will cover in his closing speech the focus of my speech be primarily on the remembrance part of this debate believe that politician well honour the fall by never forget the lesson of the war in which they fight this mean never be complacent about the threat we face and do everything possible to strengthen our deterrence so that this country be never again embroil in the senseless slaughter of existential war it must be obvious to all of we that the threat of such war loom large over our continent than it have for many year to that end and say this with respect to the secretary of state it be profoundly ill judge of he to suggest at time when deterrence be of paramount importance that britain be not ready to fight war reassure the british public million of whom will soon wear their poppy with pride that our armed force remain among the good in the world after all it would be wholly unrealistic to expect this nation to fight russia single handedly the challenge be to be ready to fight and deter as part of nato and no one should be in any doubt of the outsized scale of our contribution to the alliance first and foremost we unambiguously and unflinchingly offer our nuclear deterrent for the defence of all european nato ally and we be incredibly proud to have deliver continuous at sea deterrent every day since moreover during nato steadfast defender exercise early this year its large such exercise since the end of the cold war we lead the way with service personnel eight warship and submarine and an aircraft carrier plus tank artillery helicopter and poseidon surveillance aircraft that be not the contribution of nation unable to fight as we prepare to look back and remember past conflict the most important example of our readiness be not an exercise but real world war that be happen on our continent today when it come to putin illegal invasion of ukraine the uk under the previous government play singular leadership role which start before the russian tank roll in since we have train thousand of ukrainians to fight and we provide crucial anti tank weaponry before the invasion commence that help the ukrainians to defy expectation and stay in the fight surely we can all see that have ukraine fall early the world would have be an even more dangerous place with our adversary embolden and with nato border potentially threaten as the previous secretary of state grant shapps reveal president zelensky have say that the uk more than any other nation have be responsible for help to ensure that the majority of ukraine remain free more than two year after russia main attack far from talk down our armed force we should be extremely proud of the role we have play in support ukraine fight for freedom that say of course we have our challenge first and foremost be the need to replenish munition not least after gift so many to ukraine that be why in april we set out fully fund plan to increase defence spending to of gdp by pay for by reduce the civil service to its pre pandemic size and prioritise billion of additional funding for replenishment do the shadow minister think that the conservative party be miss the point of this debate by seek to score political point with respect think the hon gentleman miss the point of my speech as say at the beginning be here to talk about remembrance and sincerely believe that the good way to honour the fall be by learn the lesson of the past that mean always stand up for our country and ensure that we have the strong possible deterrent that be why with budget on wednesday it really matter that we talk about defence spending in this debate this be matter of supreme national interest as we prepare to remember all those life lose serve in our navy and merchant fleet this replenishment would have address key emerge threat to our naval ship that have be expose in the red sea such as by fund dragonfire laser procurement to tackle drone and upgrade our sea viper system to combat ballistic missile people may think that that be not relevant but after all the tragedy we see when we lose those ship in the falklands we should be do everything possible urgently to procure system that can help to defend our ship against these emerge threat another key challenge be retention we know that we need to do everything possible to support those who serve in our armed force today two day from the budget hope that the secretary of state have read today warn in the times online that hundred may leave the armed force because of the government education tax the article quote the many service personnel who have email with their concern such as the wife of an army major who write the extra will make thing extremely difficult and we fear we will have to choose between my husband career or our daughter education labour should not be force thousand of military family to make so stark choice when we can not afford to lose such experienced personnel and when it cost almost head to train just one much less experienced replacement finally there be the key issue of accommodation be proud of the additional million that the conservative government inject to help address damp mould and the many other problem that routinely affect our military home however as someone with background in housing before enter parliament it be clear to from day one as the minister responsible for the defence estate that we have to do something far more radical give the inherent structural problem with so much of our service accommodation that be why build on my predecessor jeremy quin work to put the wheel in motion so that subject to negotiation we could buy back the defence estate from annington homes if we really want home fit for hero as be sure we all do strongly believe that we need complete rebuild of the defence estate rather than year to year sticking plaster solution it could be one of the country most exciting regeneration project but it require ownership to be fully restore and that mean annington of course annington be an area of considerable legal and commercial sensitivity so do not expect direct answer but hope the government will continue to build on my considerable work in that area if we be truly to honour the fall we must do everything to avoid future conflict by have the strong possible deterrence have huge respect for the secretary of state but believe it be mistake to say that we be not ready to fight we now need to see whether he be ready to fight for our armed force we need two thing in wednesday budget vat exemption on school fee for force family and clear pathway to spend of gdp on defence so that we can urgently replenish our munition stock to war fight level those who serve our country deserve no less rise today in common with many other hon member to express my immense gratitude and admiration for all our veteran of today and yesteryear also rise to speak from different angle represent slough one of the most ethnically diverse constituency and be the first turbane sikh to be elect to parliament believe have specific duty to speak out for those who have often be relegate to the footnote of history but whose sacrifice must not be sideline it be more important than ever particularly have see our street recently fill with far right hatred that remembrance be not exclusive the contribution of all those who have sacrifice their life must be remember in particular it can not be ignore that both world war could not have be win by british bear troop alone without the contribution of soldier bear beyond our own border in world war one approximately million brave soldier from commonwealth country lay down their life to protect our some african serviceman be decorate in recognition of their valour troop from the british west indies regiment be award medal and receive mention in dispatch more than million people from what be modern day india pakistan and bangladesh contribute to the war effort form largely voluntary army of hindus muslims christians sikhs and many other faith indeed today over of our current force be from ethnic minority if we fail properly to commemorate and celebrate the contribution of our armed force whose root lie in country across the globe we do our own history huge disservice come from strong military background myself my great grandfather lose leg fighting in the first world war my grandmother brother and other family member fight in the second world war feel immense pride in that share history it be staggering that despite make up just of pre partition british india sikhs form of the indian army be immensely proud of those who fight so valiantly and believe that such contribution should be properly commemorate that be why serve as president of the national sikh war memorial trust and have passionately campaign for several year for fitting memorial in central london to those sikh soldier so that we may remember the ten of thousand of turbane sikhs who sacrifice their life and the more than who be injure during both world war we must ensure that remembrance serve as reminder to all that the freedom we enjoy today be hard fight for by force as diverse as modern day britain we can not airbrush the past despite the effort of some right wing commentator to do just that in kevin maguire from the mirror and have to educate laurence fox on sikh sacrifice during world war one follow his bigote comment that the film be somehow woke or racist for its inclusion of sikh soldier to his credit laurence fox later apologise after he have be hit with some hard fact but that ignorance have root in much of the culture of remembrance and must be challenge even today force who stand shoulder to shoulder with british troop struggle to get the recognition they deserve but have no doubt that my right hon friend the defence secretary will rectify that for example gurkha pension be fall short of the army standard it take fight to get certain visa fee scrap for non uk service personnel and recent error in the afghan relocation and assistance policy have leave triples force out in the cold pervasive racism cause failure to treat world war one casualty from india west africa east africa egypt and somalia equally my right hon friend the foreign secretary campaign effectively on that important matter but there should not be another battle simply to get parity those who serve alongside british troop should be beacon of hope for collective pride that go beyond border colour or background their commitment to our country mean they be willing to sacrifice everything for it those contribution should be celebrate not sideline their commitment in the darkest of time ensure our safety fundamentally without the sacrifice and contribution of the million of personnel across the globe we would simply not have the privilege of sit here today they have ensure our collective freedom we must never take for grant the hard win freedom to operate under democracy to live in pluralist society and to be safe it be simply not enough to be thankful we must celebrate their service honour their duty and always remember those who have make the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our nation we will remember they call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party today we gather to honour the sacrifice and contribution of our veteran brave man and woman who have selflessly put their life on the line for our country each one of they embody the courage resilience and dedication that define the spirit of service we should not just recognise their service on the battlefield but understand the challenge they continue to face once they return home start with bit of my own story serve in the british army as part of the royal military police do not come from military family my journey begin with desire to lead travel and make difference study language at university and be draw to the british army role in international aid and disaster relief think it would eventually lead into humanitarian work training at sandhurst be gruelle especially with equipment that be not design for woman but come out of that experience with friendship that have last lifetime with people who see through my high and low point after sandhurst be deploy to bosnia where my platoon be already station as part of the stabilisation force sfor nato peacekeeping force work alongside american british canadian czech and dutch troop witness at first hand the disparity in resource and funding the contrast be stark our american counterpart have advanced equipment with all the bell and whistle while we operate with much less that show not only the resilience of our troop but the challenge we face due to limited resource shortly after that be send to iraq on operation telic iv with the battalion princess of wales royal regiment task with retrain the iraqi police force and support police effort to train over of the iraqi police service in maysan province volatile and dangerous area we train the police outside our camp and in old air basis with unexploded ordnance next to we and visit police station support the ips with their work we distribute car equipment weapon and money to the ips and gather intelligence on iranian weapon smuggling just year before my arrival six of my rmp colleague be kill in majar al kabir vividly remember the fear of my first night age just travel in black out bus after land in maysan en route to camp abu naji really unsure of what lie ahead fear imagine many soldier face today the fear of the unknown the fear of what be to come especially those on the frontline in place such as ukraine iraq be not easy we come under fire regularly and some of my fellow soldier do not make it home tension escalate when photo be publish falsely show british soldier abuse iraqi detainee for several day our base be surround by angry armed local there be lot of tension but we get through it together on the base there be over soldier but only three female officer and handful of female non commission officer the one positive thing about that be that at least could get to the toilet and the shower without queue despite the challenge be grateful for the brave interpreter local police and all the other local who work with we on camp and out on the ground we must remember the sacrifice local people on operation make to support our armed force abroad after return to the uk we start family and have to make choice between family and career with no military support to help balance these responsibility eventually leave the army early than have plan that be too common story as the haythornthwaite review highlight the most common reason service member leave the armed force be the impact on family and personal life there be no option for as mother would have be send to afghanistan next and there be no nursery on the frontline there be no flexible career path for and be not alone many service member face pressure that extend beyond the battlefield and we simply need to do more to support they be immensely proud of my constituency connection to the armed force we have langley vale where more than soldier train during the first world war it be where lord kitchener famously inspect the troop and it now serve as place of reflection with beautiful sculpture honour our military past our local royal engineers the geographic squadron recently celebrate their anniversary this year proudly march with bayonet fix exercise their freedom of epsom and ewell these be powerful reminder of the sacrifice make by generation of service member honour our veteran go beyond remembrance it be about action there be press issue that we must address to ensure that veteran and their family be support after their service housing be one such issue it be unacceptable that more than household with veteran be assess as homeless last year high quality affordable accommodation for veteran should be accessible across the country no one who serve our nation should face homelessness the winter fuel allowance be another concern many veteran struggle financially and recent cut to the allowance will hit some of they hard it be lifeline especially in colder month and veteran should be able to rely on this support military compensation also need reform the current system often count military compensation towards means test benefit in about veteran receive compensation for injury sustain during service but many council count it as income penalise veteran who desperately need support that practice go against the armed force covenant and it be time that we change those rule do my hon friend agree that the government should give serious thought to exclude military compensation when calculate pension credit agree with my hon friend as my hon friend the member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron mention we also need to improve mental health support for veteran more than half of veteran have face mental health challenge yet hesitate to seek support due to stigma to reduce stigma and encourage more veteran to seek the support that they need we need regular mental health check up for veteran along with well tracking of both physical and mental health outcome female veteran face additional challenge include high unemployment rate and great risk of harassment the atherton report find that nearly two third of female veteran experience bullying or harassment during service that be unacceptable and we must implement recommendation to protect and support woman who serve finally our veteran deserve justice those dismiss because of their sexuality be be offer compensation of which be wholly insufficient and fail to reflect the harm that they endure the government must reassess the scheme to ensure these veteran receive fair compensation we thank all charity who support our armed force and we remember those who have fall but as we remember the contribution of those who have serve let we honour their sacrifice with action we need system that truly support our service personnel veteran and their family that mean address issue range from housing and pay to diversity and equality our veteran deserve not just our respect but our commitment to make real difference in their life rise order will now impose an immediate time limit of three minute for back bench speech and six minute for maiden speech call jodie gosling to

reflect upon the freedom and privilege that we often take for grant in this country freedom of speech the rule of law and democracy be value for which our forefather fight bravely each generation must make sacrifice to ensure that their child can live in freedom we see that most clearly today in eastern europe where ukraine fight to defend itself from the barbaric assault on its democracy by putin

lawrence church the brackley service at winchester house school and the act of remembrance in bozeat cemetery will also join the local branch of the royal british legion to sell poppy since my election to this place have join the armed force parliamentary scheme and have have the opportunity to see at first hand how crucial it be that we support our serve man and woman properly in world where threat be rise we should be invest more not less in our armed force be proud to stand on manifesto that commit to raise defence spending to of gdp and be disappointed that the labour government can not make the same outright commitment our veteran be the very good of we and should be give the right support to transition out of active duty and into civilian life the previous government put veterans minister around the cabinet table for the first time tackle veteran homelessness through operation fortitude create dedicated veteran mental health pathway in operation courage and introduce the veteran railcard if we be to honour the sacrifice of those who come before we if we be to keep our promise to make the uk the good place to be veteran and if we be to ensure that the cause of freedom be defend around the world we must fund our armed force properly call dan tomlinson to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker may start by praise my hon friend the member for nuneaton jodie gosling for her fantastic maiden speech like other labour members have nuneaton sear into my memory because of its role in the general election it be nice now to be able to think of such fantastic speech when think of nuneaton pay tribute to my predecessor as the mp for chipping barnet theresa villiers who serve with much hard work and diligence over her year of service she be hard work member of parliament and hope to follow in her footstep in that regard just yesterday be with member of the east barnet branch of the royal british legion and think then as we think now of all those who have give their life and livelihood to service to keep our country safe chipping barnet be not as some may assume in the cotswolds which be home to chipping norton and jeremy clarkson farm although we do have farm in the constituency we be in fact suburb of london part of the london borough of barnet and it be the suburb that would like to speak about today for it be my contention that when political party understand the suburb it be able then and only then to speak on behalf of and govern for the country as whole let give the house little history of chipping barnet back in the weary traveller try to make their way northward out of london on the great north road would find that the natural resting point for their first night stay would be chipping barnet where no few than public house could put they up for the night will ensure that continue support and patronise the pub in chipping barnet during my time in office if we roll forward year we get to the extension of the northern line to the constituency join we up with the city of london proper with relatively liberal planning system that connectivity enable surge of housebuilding which labour members will think about be sure when we seek to build and invest for the future chipping barnet be home as say to wonderful farm and green space and many of we move to barnet because we value house with garden room to raise the kid and maybe even space to park the car out front the aspiration of suburban life let say to people of faith in my constituency just how grateful be for the warmth with which have be receive in church synagogue and mosque in particular say to jewish and muslim resident that will always stand with they against the antisemitism and islamophobia that know have be on the rise in recent month and over the past year it be important to do good work locally as member of parliament but it be my firm belief that we must raise our game in this house and nationally if we be to truly make difference for our constituent the need for change be great go be the day when child could grow up in low income family and on free school meal just as do but with the security of social security system that be there for they and genuinely affordable social housing represent the suburb be just as much about stand up for the people who can not afford to or do not commute into town as it be about represent those who do people aspiration for well life for their family and community be still there but it be not be meet be talk about the deal of suburban life people who put in so much spend their time stick in traffic or on the northern line raise their kid to know right from wrong and serve in their community and work hard expect in return that the government will just get some thing right by provide public service that be there when need and ensure that the economy be strong and grow see that deal fall apart somewhat during my time as an economist before enter this house work at the treasury for time and then at the resolution foundation and the joseph rowntree foundation see that deal fall apart in chart and in number on spreadsheet but since become parliamentary candidate and then member of parliament have hear at first hand from constituent in the suburb about how that deal have fall apart think of young people who can not afford to move out of their parent home and own or rent in the suburb think of many resident who want to buy new car but be scared that if they do it will be steal and the police will not follow up those everyday aspiration be not be meet any more my work in this place our work on the labour benches will be to rebuild that deal of suburbia and ensure that those who put in so much get it back again say to resident of chipping barnet whether they live in brunswick park whetstone totteridge mill hill east arkley edgwarebury underhill or one of the many barnets high barnet east barnet new barnet or barnet vale that it be the honour of my life to serve and represent they will do all can for our community during my time in this place call rebecca paul to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for allow the opportunity to deliver my maiden speech in this important debate about remember the valiant action of those who have fight to keep this country safe it be privilege to rise as the newly elect member of parliament for reigate constituency that be proud to represent and serve be deeply grateful to the people of reigate redhill banstead and our village for place their trust in before turn to an issue of great importance to my constituent must acknowledge my predecessor crispin blunt who be himself veteran have not rush to deliver my maiden speech not least out of desire to give careful thought to the word choose ironically it seem that crispin face similar conundrum in in fact do not think can do well than to quote from his own maiden speech it must be admit that sir george gardiner do not end his conservative party career in blaze of glory sir george be resolute battler for the cause he believe in and although many of we question his judgment at the end no one could question the resolve with which he steer his choose course official report june vol my sincere hope be that when my successor rise to deliver their maiden speech they be not inclined to give those word third airing in this house that say would like to recognise crispin blunt year of public service and also pay tribute to his team no mp achieve anything without great team support they and crispin team serve our community with diligence and grace during many challenge time take this opportunity to thank they especially teresa craig who have go above and beyond in the past year to help many thousand of constituent also pay tribute to lord grayling the former mp for epsom and ewell thank to recent boundary change have welcome the ward of nork and tattenham corner and preston into the reigate constituency chris be an exceptional local mp and thank he for all his support let now turn to subject close to my heart my wonderful home reigate be constituency that encapsulate the very good of both town and country trinity of town in the most beautiful part of surrey each with its own unique character and identity we have the historic town of reigate with its wind street independent shop and proud heritage it be place of immense charm and community spirit and notably be the location of the first road tunnel build in england it be the birthplace of margot fonteyn one of the great classical ballerina of all time and be also the place where both our current prime minister and fatboy slim be educate just north of the town stand reigate fort victorian structure intend to serve as last line of defence in the event that the south have fall and defeat seem certain role not unlike that which reigate play in the recent general election then there be redhill railway town that pulse with energy and ambition transport hub and centre for business commerce and the art it be home to an inspirational lioness and some lobster as the place where the existence of solar flare be first confirm redhill shin bright as vivacious young sister to reigate finally we have banstead which offer quieter appeal with its village feel and beautiful common its bustling high street be adorn with gorgeous flower that be lovingly tend by local resident it be community whose respectful patriotism be keenly feel especially at this time of year must take this opportunity to recognise and thank the banstead and district royal british legion branch whose member do an outstanding job pay tribute to and raise money for our armed force and veteran beyond our town we be bless with many picturesque village each with its own charm disappointingly madam deputy speaker there be not enough time for to tell you about all of they so will tell you about just one walton on the hill with its serene pond world class golf and history of feisty suffragette it be the place choose to settle and raise my family like thief walton steal my heart and must thank the prime minister for give it early release madam deputy speaker it will not surprise you to hear that the green belt be one of the reason why the town and village of my constituency be so unique we be incredibly fortunate to be surround by beautiful countryside from the roll hill of the north down to the open green space of banstead common this country need more home so there now come pressure to build on the green belt because it be easy but that be the lazy solution the new government talk about develop brownfield first which very much support but just say the word be not enough for build on those site to become reality we need tangible action to make brownfield development economically viable we also need to have an honest conversation about the impact of reduce housing target in london while nearly double they in reigate and banstead even if by some miracle my local council could deliver on those target they would simply be build home for people from london to move into not meet the local need and certainly not bring down house price if we be to break the cycle we must densify in city where essential infrastructure be already in place hope this labour government will consider tackle the issue of housing with the same spirit show by the labour government elect in the final month of the second world war then as now the country be in desperate need of more home clement attlee deliver million of they while insist both on densification and ensure that development be concentrate in city and town mr attlee set out to build his new jerusalem primarily as fitting tribute to generation of servicemen who fight endure and suffer to keep this country safe from fascist tyranny that heroic generation include flight lieutenant douglas adcock from redhill who fly ultra high risk mission for the photographic reconnaissance squadron at raf

soar the thames and dwindle off down auster to greet professor lal he once meet morgan forster my contact and my pal think what get to then be the soar sneer cynicism of the persona that the poet have create of the travel academic look down both metaphorically and literally on the cenotaph service here in westminster think it offend my sense of fairness soldier by and large have little choice in what they be call to do equally they have little choice in the way in which the nation subsequently remember they they just do what they be call to do this year mark year since day and one of my constituent don sheppard who die aged this year be veteran of both day and arnhem on the point my hon friend be make don quote be the lad that do make it back those be the other one we need to

it as former soldier who have lose man let get one thing straight these man and woman die for we all to be free free to do whatever the law of the land permit we to do to wear poppy not to wear poppy to remember not to remember it be our freedom it be our choice and on day like remembrance sunday there be not soldier sailor airman or royal marine for whom that question could matter less they be in another place they be see the face of lose friend they be feel guilty for have survive when their friend have not they be try to hold it together long enough for open time to come at the pub if may say on their behalf thank you thank you for be here in this debate today and at the constituency garden of remembrance early thank you for the respect thank you for your thank you the act of remembrance be little like go to church some people go to church once year some once week for remembrance it could be two minute silence once year for some or just find two minute peace in day from the awfulness of the loss of son or daughter for another regardless here today we will remember they and we will honour our fallen be veteran and it be great to be veteran learn so much from my service in the military have so many great experience be proud to play my own small part in afghanistan and work with some fantastic people it be great to be veteran serve be not all sunshine and rose but can recommend no well career for someone in their than to join our military but with the joy of service can come sadness my constituency have many diverse town and village the ex pit town of clay cross dronfield with its bustling heart or killamarsh with its proud derbyshire spirit but they all have one thing in common at the heart of each of they be war memorial with the name of those lose in conflict over the previous year these name be all once live breathe member of their community much love brother son father other relative and friend and it be they think of when wear the poppy there can be lot of very clever discourse about the poppy which be such simple and humble flower the fact be that the poppy appeal be truly successful grassroots movement the first poppy appeal see over million sell in its first year all wear by ordinary man and woman who come together because they have lose love one and want to remember they grainy black and white photograph from the show people stand in remembrance ceremony in the cold and silent november air their grief clear to see on their face even in those more stoic time the poppy truly spontaneously unite million of people in hope some may not bear to see that unity but it be something that still unite million of people today would like briefly to address few point that have be raise it be very important that we learn the lesson of the past year and that we understand who make the decision regard our armed force and why those decision be make who sell off our valuable military housing stock so cheaply to annington believe it be the conservatives who pull our force back from important basis in germany even as russia become active in ukraine again it be the conservatives who waste billion of pound on procurement and reduce the offer to serve personnel lead to haemorrhage in the number serve in our military it be the conservatives who oversee the reduction of our military size to barely be able to field brigade minus it be the conservatives so yes let we have accountability but it start with an iota of shame from the party opposite before they be allow anywhere near our defence again at least however some of they be here note that not every party have representative present would also like to add briefly in response that one tenet very close to my heart as veteran be that the rule of law be of the high importance order call liz saville roberts in the time that have would like to raise couple of matter particularly relevant to wales and also say what delight it be to hear all the maiden speech this evening the post of veterans commissioner for wales be establish two year ago and be hold by colonel james phillips but his appointment be due to come to an end on december please will the minister in his closing remark update the house on approval to extend this role colonel phillips second annual report be publish last month and it make clear why commissioner be crucial for veteran in wales so they be not fail by the jagged edge of devolved and reserved power core state funding from both the welsh and uk governments be necessary to make sure veteran receive proper care in health and housing which be devolve as well as reserve matter such as welfare and justice some of the veteran population in wales be over year old and be over alongside health the cost of living be significant challenge for old veteran and of course military compensation should not be treat as income for the purpose of benefit and pension an income disregard should be introduce for the war pension and armed forced compensation scheme this be about not just the veteran themselves but the third sector provider on which veteran support rely so heavily in wales those provider have see steep increase in operational cost and reduce funding organisation such as woody lodge and vc gallery have be particularly hard hit that be important while initiative such as op courage op restore and op nova have receive new money in england in wales they do not exist and we have not see equivalent funding either leave many critical service fund hand to mouth from year to year through grant this evening be also proud to support the campaign for an official memorial to remember and honour the pilot and navigator of the raf photographic reconnaissance unit that be be organise as we speak by the spitfire project the pru fly highly dangerous clandestine mission to take intelligence photo its strip down plane be unarmed so as to carry as much fuel as possible for that reason the pru include

welcome the secretary of state to his place and be delighted that fellow scot have take the role of minister for veterans and people scottish community have play vital role in the history of our military and in my constituency more than people have serve in our armed force the ceremony of remembrance that we take part in be important for we all but for thousand of people in my constituency and their family they speak to their personal experience of service one of the great privilege that have have in my career be to work for veteran charity sight scotland veterans among the veteran we support too many have experience isolation and loneliness one of the veteran work with be william montgomerie know to everyone as monty who have serve in germany cyprus and northern ireland before leave the army in while serve in the territorial army monty suffer head injury that mean that he could not work that in turn affect his mental health he say have go from work and have the camaraderie

suicidal monty be now an eloquent and effective campaigner on the need to provide well support for our veteran that support be the debt that we owe they as society but as we have hear throughout this evening debate too often we fall short that be why this government commitment to put the armed force covenant fully into law and to create an armed force commissioner be so important in scotland the role of the scottish veterans commissioner have be vital to the assessment of progress in scotland on secure the aim of the covenant in her most recent report as commissioner susie hamilton find progress in number of area but also note disappointingly progress towards the delivery of both the veterans mental health and wellbeing pathway and the veterans homelessness prevention pathway remain notably slow hope that the scottish government will take careful note of those point too many veteran still face poor mental health and do not have the housing support that they need that be why the prime minister commitment that we will repay all those who serve we and house all veteran who be in housing need be so important our armed force champion in fife councillor derek noble serve in the regiment royal artillery himself the aim of the covenant be be take forward through the council and we be proud that it have achieve the covenant gold standard our veteran have give so much for their country we must not only mark that with gratitude and respect on remembrance day but ensure that our nation meet all its responsibility to all our veteran it be an honour to pay tribute to our armed

maiden speech this afternoon and evening they do so under time pressure which add layer of complexity that be glad do not have as mention in my maiden speech grow up on an raf base in berlin as member might expect remembrance be huge part of my early memory the service always include veteran of the world war but also of korea where my grandfather serve the falklands and the violence in northern ireland during the election campaign be not surprise by the scale of the veteran community in my constituency of dunfermline and dollar the area have strong naval tradition and the rest of fife have strong presence throughout the raf the army and other unit it strike however how spread out veteran be many be unaware of the size of the veteran community in the area we must do more locally to bring those community together it be clear that the level of support across scotland and be sure the rest of the uk be mixed but fear that in some area scotland be fall behind on these priority it be sad that there be no member from the scottish national party in the chamber this evening we must do well to co ordinate together want to share the story of couple of veteran from my community and constituency this weekend take my two daughter to the carnegie library which have fantastic local history museum it tell the story of alexander malcolm mcneill who die on july the first day of the battle of the somme the second story that want to share be that of norman bonnar who live in the garvock area of dunfermline and serve throughout the early part of the war as spitfire pilot with the photographic reconnaissance unit on july he be kill when the wellington aircraft he be in crashed he be bury in dunfermline cemetery and posthumously award the distinguished flying cross recently be pleased to meet some of the team behind the restoration of spitfire which have be refer to it be fly by norman bonnar hope that we can recognise such effort by have memorial to the sacrifice of the

rauf with my year old daughter hannah be only halfway through the book but it be focus on remember those in india and the far east who serve in world war two and would recommend it to anyone in this house tell the story of people such as alexander and norman be just small sample of what we must do to remember to return to the main point we must always ensure that remembrance be translate into support for those currently serve and those who will serve in the future my constituency have deep historic connection with the uk armed force today it be home to army training centre pirbright and substantial part of the royal military academy sandhurst this evening though want to draw attention to two veteran have have the privilege of meeting and get to know in surrey heath over the past few

justice and recognition carol morgan want to be in the army since she be little girl it be commitment conviction and vocation yet when she be only she be unceremoniously discharge from the women royal army corps solely because of who she love although homosexuality be decriminalise in those who be gay in the uk armed force prior to the year have to keep their identity and feeling hide after be report on by colleague carol recall relentless interrogation about the most intimate detail of her life and countless humiliation that leave she feeling like criminal for lgbt veteran be find to be gay meant be discharge and the loss of their career livelihood medal and pension in some case it mean imprisonment tragically the trauma of those experience lead many to take their own life and thousand of lgbt veteran suffer long term harm under this atrocious policy while acknowledge that progress have undoubtedly be make there have be an apology from the former prime minister an lgbt veteran independent review and million compensation fund true justice remain elusive for the approximately veteran whose life be irreparably alter be meagre offering hope that the government will use this budget and remembrance season to reconsider the scale of that scheme and to give those veteran the recognition that they truly deserve also note the furore around the royal british legion poppy badge that have the lgbt flag alongside it the outrage might be reserve to fringe television station in the uk but it be reminder that the injustice endure by many lgbt veteran be still far from resolve or reconcile even now in pay tribute to the gurkha community whose regimental headquarters be in surrey heath for over two century soldier from nepal have fight bravely for the british army in the uk most pivotal conflict from both world war to the falklands bosnia iraq and afghanistan we owe they debt of gratitude for their loyalty their courage and their sacrifice particularly want to

people recount an operation that he conduct in afghanistan and speak of the commitment that those whom he command be able to give to their mission because of their certainty about the wraparound

disparity stephen sibling who be bear before their father be expose to the detonation experience good health but those who be bear afterwards experience poor health this be pattern that stephen have see not just in his own family but in the family of veteran he have since encounter in the run up to the election the previous government go so far as to make sure that medal be cast to recognise the servicepeople who be involve in operation grapple in opposition labour suggest that they could go far the veteran have talk to for example those in the sidmouth branch of the royal british legion feel that the government need to go far they would like an annual remembrance event such as the one attend in sidmouth on august to honour the service of the dwindle number of veteran who see the nuclear

veteran will focus my comment on the woman six out of of whom be in uniform who serve at bletchley park they be often forget they be in the women royal naval service the wrens the women auxiliary air force the waaf and the auxiliary territorial service they work around the clock for the war effort to keep the colossus and bombe machine run so that we could break the nazi code their effort shorten the war by nearly two year save countless life their recruitment be challenge to as it have never recruit woman before it start recruit linguist mathematician and engineer and even use minute cryptic crossword competition to identify talent however the woman do not have it easy when winston churchill visit he say know tell you to leave no stone unturned to get staff but do expect you to take literally many famous woman work tirelessly during those year but it be not until the that anybody include some of their own have an idea of the impact they have have on our war effort the woman be not allow to be classify as code breaker and be not allow the title or the pay but today in this house we can call they veteran and give they the respect they deserve one of they write this poem in the year yet to come when grandchild be many want you to know what do before you be granny you say to the child as proud as can be in the last war my darling waaf at bp as the member of parliament for the home of the british army it be my honour to speak in this debate on remembrance and veteran will use my time to share story from veteran of the royal marines who celebrate his birthday today my constituent have give permission to share his story in the debate although have change his name to protect his privacy john serve our country with honour he be discharge from the royal marines after three year of service but life outside the military be hard his mental health spiral he end up homeless sleep rough on the street so he go to the local authority for help this be the part of his story that shock because john be tell that before the local authority could help he it have first to confirm that he really be homeless rather than take john at his word he be tell that he would have to continue to sleep rough in name location for two week and wait for an outreach worker to visit he to verify that he be homeless john do as he be order follow what he have be teach by his service but he find stay in the same place mean he be target with verbal and physical abuse so he move and keep move the cycle go on for year eventually he be diagnose with complex post traumatic stress disorder and refer to op courage even then it take several more year in temporary accommodation and he witness violent incident before op courage and help for heroes be able to get john the specialist accommodation in my constituency that have allow he to start to move forward with his life know just how great step it be for john to share his story with take three thing from john story the first be that we owe our veteran much more than our silence and respect on armistice day it be our duty to speak up whenever the system that come from this place fall short secondly safe and accessible housing be vital that be why be so proud to hear just few week ago the prime minister announce the government commitment to house all veteran thirdly john experience tell that our commitment to respect every veteran must reach through every government department and every level of staff if we be to succeed from the secretary of state down to every member of frontline staff that be the culture change need to deliver for people such as john who have serve our country the spirit of remembrance be define by what we do for one another and the contribution that every one of we can make with shared effort we can build great legacy for those who serve we now and in the future it be appropriate that follow my hon friend the member for aldershot alex baker as intend to speak on mental health support for veteran ahead of today debate have conversation with very good friend of mine who proudly serve in the guards what be about to say reflect comment that he have give to both from his experience and from consultation with his comrade about their personal experience mental health be at the forefront of concern for those leave the armed force serve personnel receive excellent mental health care from specialist clinician which be available for up to six month from discharge but civilian service often do not appreciate the toll that military life take on the mental and physical health of veteran so they rely on charity such as military veteran football club to fill that gap be pleased to hear the secretary of state recognise the support of veteran charity veteran also tell that the pressure of cut in the armed force impact their mental health as politician we must be sure not to ask individual servicemen and woman to take up that strain but instead ask how we can support our troop and ensure that service personnel know that they be appreciate they will be properly pay and there will be time for family life we must also normalise discussion of emotion and feeling to tackle the tragically high level of suicide among veteran this be silent killer affect people of all age and rank it do not discriminate and be the tip of an iceberg of depression anxiety and stress it can be treat by an early intervention young people and our veteran be lose their life from not only lack of support but an ignorance of the support that be available as signatory to the armed force covenant welcome the government commitment to put it on statutory footing veteran need to hear from we that they be not just number there be no stigma attach to their service and once they have leave the force we will care for they in the same way that they take care of we it be an honour to speak in this debate ahead of remembrance day as we pay tribute to all those who have serve our country and remember those who make the ultimate sacrifice each year we gather to recognise the bravery of our veteran but true gratitude go beyond these moment it mean show up for they when it count in real and meaningful way as the mp for burton and uttoxeter be proud to represent community with long stand tradition of service many family across burton uttoxeter and our surround village have story of love one who have serve and sacrifice see veteran every day who continue to give back contribute to our community long after they have hang up their uniform people such as carlton wilkin veteran of the mercian regiment who lead the poppy appeal in burton every year help we to remember the value that our veteran live by they volunteer mentor and inspire quietly set an example of resilience and dedication for we all we be also fortunate to have the national memorial arboretum on our doorstep powerful place of reflection and tribute to our armed force would welcome all right hon and hon member come to visit the arboretum to fully appreciate the courage and sacrifice that be represent there let we be clear that our gratitude must be match with support charity such as care after combat offer lifeline for veteran as they transition into civilian life by provide mental health support and give veteran renew purpose such organisation show we what it mean to truly honour service with action be commit as be the government to ensure that veteran in burton uttoxeter and across the country have access to the service that they need from mental health support and housing to employment opportunity we owe they nothing less our responsibility be to ensure that they can thrive and to meet their sacrifice with practical last action as we come together in this remembrance season let we promise that our gratitude will be live not just speak let we commit to be there for veteran as they be there for we by build country and community in which they be fully support every step of the way as we approach this time of remembrance be it fitting that the national parliament of the uk reflect on the sacrifice make by so many man and woman to ensure that we have the right to be here in this place and that our democratic value prevail indeed understand that the first world war claim of our predecessor while the second world war claim while we think of the contribution of our veteran it be wise to take moment to think about non combatant who be also often the victim of war on march bankhead primary school in my constituency be hit by luftwaffe bomb fortunately the school have be evacuate but it be serve as civil defence station and people be kill the reason for the strike be never fully explain it could have be remnant of the clydebank blitz with one of the luftwaffe pilot drop bomb to lighten the load for the way home or it could have be because of the nearby railway marshalling yard in yoker we will never know but the fact be that civilian die some year ago terrence mccourt local knightswood man begin campaign for war memorial to be erect in his area terrence campaign be successful and small but very beautiful garden of remembrance be establish in my glasgow west constituency regular event take place there to remember important date such as armistice day vj day and ve day on remembrance sunday many of we will stand in glasgow george square to watch the march of veteran and current servicemen and woman as well as of representative of the emergency and uniformed service sadly but inevitably the number of veteran diminish every year so it be more important than ever that their memory be not allow to fade unfortunately neither world war be the war to end all war the event of the past century be sadly testament to that as parliamentarian we must be dedicate to the eradication of conflict through peaceful and democratic mean that be worthy objective to which hope we all subscribe but it be one that remain in peril in this increasingly dangerous conflict tear world for the sake of this generation and generation yet unborn we must redouble our effort to support diplomatic and peaceful mean of resolve even the most seemingly intractable situation after all we can not make peace by talk only to our friend as gandhi put it an eye for an eye only end up make the whole world blind at the heart of my constituency lie carlisle castle home to the museum of the border regiment the excellent cumbria museum of military life the border regiment have long and proud record of service and be the first british unit to join major engagement by glider during the invasion of sicily in the second world war the regiment go on to serve throughout the italian campaign and wish to pay particular tribute to those who serve in that campaign my dad be just when he set sail for the italian mainland but the liberation of italy have begin some month early with the invasion of sicily that invasion cost the life of allied troop include man from carlisle border regiment who be kill when their glider fail to make land the invasion of the mainland follow but the ally encounter increasingly difficult terrain in particular monte cassino become the scene of some of the most hellish encounter of the second world war finally in the early hour of may the british and polish troop surround the town of cassino and force german retreat couple of week later rome fall mark significant milestone in the italian campaign sadly for those who serve their recognition be overshadow by the event on the normandy beach to add further insult to injury perception grow that those serve in italy be sit out the real fighting of the second world war and the myth of the day dodger be bear nothing could have be far from the truth infantry loss on both side make italy the most costly campaign of the second world war in term of casualty suffer by infantry force that be why believe that in this the year since monte cassino it be right that that battle be commemorate as other key battle of the second world war have rightly be it be an honour to be give an opportunity to speak this evening as we look ahead to this year remembrance event across the country and as we recognise the service and courage of the exceptional man and woman who help safeguard our value and freedom my contribution seek to commemorate some of the local effort from my constituency perhaps the big contribution of alloa to the day landing take place at the now go mcleod and sons shipyard the worker there labour day and night to refit ship for war include around of

czechoslovakia die as student pilot along with some ground crew who also pay the ultimate price while serve there today replica spitfire on road remind we of their sacrifice with thank to the member of the grangemouth air cadet squadron for their effort in push for that memorial more than decade ago veteran of our armed force deserve not just our respect and gratitude but our practical and meaningful help as they seek to find place in civilian life commend organisation such as the falkirk veterans and the wee county veterans from clackmannanshire the bond among our military personnel extend well beyond service and veteran group such as those in my constituency play phenomenal role in so many way there be currently difference in opinion between the royal british legion and many in the veteran community as to the consequence of cut the armed services advice project personally feel that the veteran have legitimate concern about the removal of asap some have tell that an in person interaction with an asap adviser be the difference between life and death on the face of it share the same reservation as many veteran as replace asap with call centre could be potentially fatal reduction in service provision and urge the rbl to reconsider over the last year this country have see what happen when austerity take hold and vital service be sacrifice everyone deserve well

lichfield constituency it be wonderful venue and fantastic place for people to carry out that remembrance if they so choose there be now more than memorial at the arboretum and strongly advise any right hon or hon member who have not have the opportunity to visit yet to do so so that they can take the opportunity to remember the people who be pertinent to they or even the stranger who they have

rebecca paul on her excellent speech although it be not maiden speech also thank the hon member for portsmouth north amanda martin for mention those who be lose at sea it be far too often overlook that those who be lose at sea in various conflict have no grave that family can visit but their sacrifice be no less important and should be no less remember at this time it be rare to sit in the chamber and enjoy debate where there be so much common cause on both side of the house join other hon member in congratulate the duke of york and albany maritime regiment of foot on its anniversary do

in the peace and freedom we enjoy in our country today remembrance mean different thing to different people when the last post sound in ballater in two week time will be think of my great uncle samuel coyle who fall at gallipoli in one week short of his birthday and lie bury at pink farm cemetery in turkey will think of my great grandfather who endure and survive the somme battlefield my paternal grandfather who fight with the army at el alamein sicily italy france and germany and survive to tell the tale my maternal grandfather who for over two decade serve in the royal navy and my godfather royal marine who serve from the falklands to northern ireland will also think of my friend who serve and be still serve in far more recent conflict and operation in iraq afghanistan and the various but less report naval operation of the last year our continued presence in the south atlantic our oilfield patrol off iraq and the anti piracy operation in somalia to name but few as we have hear this afternoon we all remember individual family and close friend who choose to serve our country and be prepared to and in some case do pay the ultimate sacrifice and we do remember they when we collectively think of remembrance as nation and when we think of veteran for many the image conjure up be of the old soldier who land at day proudly march with his oppos past the cenotaph survivor of long distant conflict they remain rightly at the forefront of our thought this year as we commemorate year since day monte cassino and other hugely significant operation in that world conflict which be fight to defend freedom and democracy it be our victory in that conflict that remain the reason why we can stand in this place today we remain forever in the debt of that great generation we must also remember however the veteran from much more recent conflict the much small group of man and woman who fight far from our shore in the name of queen and country but who unlike previous generation do not return to country with share experience of war and conflict in many case they return to country that do not really want to know be veteran of late century or early century conflict be in far remove from the experience of those who fight between and and between and support this new generation be far hard for those charity and organisation that do so much unseen work all year round not just during this time of remembrance it be for this new generation of former serviceman and woman that the former veterans minister johnny mercer to whom pay tribute be determined to fight that be why he be determined to make this country the good in the world in which to be veteran it be also why we as government establish the office for veterans affairs put the armed force covenant into law and set up defence transition services provide tailor support to help service people with their transition to civilian life we launch operation fortitude to end homelessness operation prosper to support veteran into work after they leave the armed force operation restore to support the physical need of veteran and operation courage to support veteran mental health we invest million to modernise thousand of military home provide funding for armed force charity to carry out their vital work and introduce new veteran railcard to help veteran reconnect both with love one and with new training and work opportunity we support veteran through the provision in our overseas operations service personnel and veterans act and the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act know the minister be aware that the repeal and replacement of that act be rightly cause concern in the community of veteran who fight during the trouble we be near unique as nation in honour the memory of all those who have fall those who have serve and those who serve in the way we do it be to our credit as country there be still group that feel forget for example as have be mention there be the veteran of our nuclear test with many still fight for recognition of what they be ask to do and for what they endure many year on for their country there be the photographic reconnaissance unit of the raf which have also be mention the unit have one of the high attrition rate in world war two but it still have no national memorial and its member must also be remember in the come day this year when the last post sound it will be some year since as very young sub lieutenant have the privilege of meet the three remain veteran of world war one harry patch henry allingham and bill stone at the cenotaph as we mark year since the end of that war the war supposedly to end all war this year let we pause and think of those unseen veteran who walk among we today those who do not return and their friend and their family still live with the loss let we also remember those who as we sit here tonight remain prepared to give everything for our nation let we recommit to do for they what grateful nation should and let we redouble our effort to truly make this country the good in the world in which to be veteran it be indeed year since the formation of the royal marines and they be still go strong will refuse to take advice from the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie on face cream but it be privilege to take the salute just the other day from both the commandant general royal marines and the commandant of the us marine corps which demonstrate the strong tie across the pond with the us between those marine unit be grateful to member for their thoughtful reflection on remembrance and the contribution of veteran to this country we have hear move contribution from member reflect on their personal experience of service and as be sure they would testify there be an unspoken oath of allegiance between service personnel indeed it know no bound it be the glue that hold the force together and that oath have always extend to the fall on the battlefield and beyond for serve personnel and veteran remembrance be an endure reflection of that oath and on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day will remember the individual who have go before we but also those have stand next to who have be kill or wound after five tour of afghanistan one of northern ireland and multiple of the arabian gulf eastern europe and africa there have be many importantly we must remember those who will never see that smile again or see they laugh or hold they close once more it be time for they and those that do not come home to see their child their partner or indeed their love one or their friend it be our duty to remember they all but remembrance be not only about fall comrade and veteran it be rare moment when the nation come together from northern ireland scotland wales and england and it be reminder to everyone in every generation across the whole country that the freedom we all enjoy the freedom of speech of equality of quality of life be all hard fight for and hard won freedom be not free and it be something in the fractious world we live in today that individually or collectively we should not take for grant those freedom be forge from the sacrifice of the young man and woman of the army navy and our air force who step forward when the country need they the sacrifice of the few who be still owe so much by the many the sacrifice on the high sea in the air on the beach and the landing ground and in the field and in the street from world war one to operation overlord where they secure beachhead in normandy that would free continent from nazi tyranny and usher in the rule base international system and the sacrifice of british service personnel who fight in the forget war on the korean peninsula to uphold the right and freedom enshrine in that rule base international system all be memorialise in stone outside the mod of which one say distant obligation honourably discharge there be the sacrifice in the south atlantic on the open water in the sky and on the windswept heath for the right of the falkland islanders to choose their own sovereign future and the sacrifice of service personnel in desert fatigue who liberate kuwait and fight in iraq and those in the operational area whom serve alongside in the long trouble of northern ireland the middle east africa afghanistan and eastern europe who sacrifice so much to uphold the right to self determination and give freedom and democracy chance to take root and the sacrifice we can not talk about because we do not comment on certain issue it be thank to all those who have serve and sacrifice and whom we honour on remembrance day that we can sit here as democratically elect mp and debate the future of this wonderful country few if any outside the armed force sign contract that put their life on the line and those who have serve or continue to serve often pay the price for that service through the long term mental or physical scar the impact on family and on their child or through the painful memory or indeed the longing for the camaraderie and service they leave behind it be my opinion that those who serve through one way or another serve until the day they die that be why this government of service be commit to stand with member of our armed force and their family long after they leave the service syd little be part of the team which deliver life save supply to mount sinjar on august in the operation now know as operation shader flight sergeant little lose his life this weekend to cancer do my hon and gallant friend agree that service people face some of their great challenge on their exit from service and that the veteran strategy be essential to ensure that those challenge be not equal to those they face while serve there be few fight as valiant as that against the barbaric regime of isis my thought go to my hon friend constituent and his family and love one who be leave behind this government be commit to support the welfare of veteran and those who be serve and there will be more detail to follow as veteran as the minister responsible for veteran people and personnel do not take these commitment lightly this government have already ensure that those who defend democracy will have the right to exercise that democracy at the polling station in just over day we have make the veteran id card form of voter id the prime minister have also confirm that veteran will rightly be prioritise in access housing furthermore we be determined to deliver on our manifesto commitment to fully incorporate the armed force covenant in law get rid of the postcode lottery and give veteran the support that they need on mental health employment and housing we will also scrap visa fee for non uk veteran who have serve for four or more year and for their family congratulate those who give their maiden speech today there be some fantastic speech particularly from my hon friend the members for nuneaton jodie gosling and for stafford leigh ingham they outline so many veteran issue but also talk about the comprehensive military presence in their constituency also pay tribute to the multiple individual with military experience in the house the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty serve in probably drop into the area he be in be very well host by his regiment or brigade be often meet on the ground with fiery reception but also some good banter it be great tribute to the house that we have so many people with military experience and like all member look forward to their contribution in this great place several issue be raise today the hon member for reigate rebecca paul the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie and the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor pay tribute to the brave pilot of the photographic reconnaissance unit who do so much intelligence gathering during the second world war without their work on operation none of those operation would have take place give that the unit have one of the high casualty rate of all those in the sky think it be plus it be right to pay tribute to it by move forward with memorial fully support that say in response to the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd that meet the welsh veterans commissioner colonel phillips last thursday speak to he about his role responsibility and potential change for good hour and half several member have bring up the issue of northern ireland our government recognise the important service of veteran and the sacrifice they make to keep people safe in northern ireland during the trouble be northern ireland veteran give the house my word that any veteran will get the legal and welfare support that they need to ensure that the stress of any action that we move forward with be minimise member bring up various charity across the veteran sector and the armed force community there be more than charity they be primarily lead by individual who give up their spare time to support the armed force and veteran as we move towards remembrance day it be worth remember not just those who have serve or be serve but those who support those in the armed force primarily in the uk amazing charitable sector which have such an important role my hon friend the member for glenrothes and mid fife richard baker bring up mental health op courage have have referral it be do fantastic job have visit multiple nhs trust that be deliver fantastic partnership work to ensure that veteran get the mental health support that they require the treatment of the lgbt community from to be completely and utterly abhorrent some of the story that have hear have be absolutely harrowing have the pleasure of attend the lgbt award last week we have deliver of the recommendation from the lord etherton review and we be work hard to deliver an appropriate financial redress scheme so that we can close out that review in timely and effective manner have the great pleasure of meet the nuclear test veteran that have be absolutely superb we have build up relationship through cadence of meeting to ensure that there be communication and education and to look into some of their issue relate to file we be work collaboratively on that it would be unfit of to finish without say that have hear some harrowing story today of the

story about some of our long serve veteran include flight lieutenant harry richardson who be now over year old which be truly remarkable the hon member for mid sussex alison bennett also outline the amazing world war two story of george as conclude it be worth note the broad message that be wrap into remembrance yes this be time to remember to remember that freedom be not free and that every decision we make in this house or in this government have an impact that do not mean that we should shy away from difficult decision on whether to deploy our armed force we should rather acknowledge and champion the fact that our armed force be there for reason to protect we at home and abroad to protect our way of life and to ensure that the freedom we enjoy today be pass down to our child and their child our armed force be the guarantor of everything we hold dear to risk life and limb for one nation be think the noble of all tradition but if service be anything it be above politic that be why stand ready to work with all hon and right hon member so that veteran and those serve can live life in and outside the armed force worthy of the incredible contribution they make to this nation

agricultural land protection motion make and question propose that this house do now smith be so pleased to have the opportunity tonight to share my pride in the rural area of my constituency of aylesbury to share my admiration for those who work on the land and care for it and to set out how we can enable both our urban and rural community and our natural environment to thrive be grateful to the minister for be present bring forward this debate in part to reassure my constituent of my own and my government commitment to protect our natural environment and safeguard our agricultural land this be subject of debate in my constituency as this new government take forward the planning reform that be so necessary for our future growth after year of deep turbulence and decline with damaging consequence for nature and for our community will suggest well way forward root in clear principle more predictability and dose of pragmatism first let turn to how we protect and enhance our natural environment and give some context relate to my constituency we be in beautiful part of the country which include the chiltern hill and historic woodland and waterway where of the constituency be designate as green belt land but under the previous government we be subject to extensive house building more than new home in the past year and counting which have lead to great pressure on service and infrastructure and also on our natural environment my constituent understand the urgency of address our national housing crisis the statistic speak for themselves nearly million household be on social housing waiting list include in buckinghamshire and young people under today be less than half as likely to own home as young adult in the equally many of my constituent understand the need for investment in renewable energy whether it be onshore wind or solar panel to get we on track for clean secure and more affordable power by but they and be conscious of the tension between the need for planning reform whether for the purpose of building house energy or other infrastructure and the need to protect our natural environment how do we navigate that tension let make three point base on aylesbury experience first we need to ensure that clear environmental safeguard be embed in planning policy and to that end the propose change in the national planning policy framework be strong for example the emphasis on brownfield first approach use previously develop land for new housing and therefore protect green space the introduction of grey belt land which of course need tight definition but should ultimately enable more strategic approach to build on certain type of green space and the golden rule in the nppf which ensure that any green belt building will bring benefit for nature and for community access to green space that will be welcome contrast to the haphazard raid on green belt and greenfield site that take place under the last government in buckinghamshire as whole for example between and of new residential address be build in designate area of outstanding natural beauty compare to national average this building have be happen and my constituent tell that the rationale for it have not always be clear secondly we need to learn from the pocket of good practice can point to one example in aylesbury the kingsbrook development on the edge of town where housing and nature co exist well kingsbrook be build with the help of the royal society for the protection of birds and include acre of wildlife rich open space with hedgehog highway and community allotment invite member of the government to visit it and to learn from such example where it be not possible for development to include so much green space we need to ensure that there be ready access to nature nearby as member of aylesbury ramblers remind recently while describe his battle with the council to keep footpath in and out of aylesbury clear thirdly of course it be vital that where nature must be protect we do that and that we do not just protect but strengthen and enhance it have see wonderful example of that in my constituency have observe the work that the chiltern society do with its volunteer for example sow wildflower or clear more than metre of footpath and mile of cycle path and bridle path in the last year alone in recent year however it have seem as if they be work against not with successive government who have show little regard for nature that be perhaps well exemplified in my constituency by the release of sewage into the river for hour last year alone with devastating consequence for nature be pleased by the early work of our government to review the environmental improvement plan pave the way we hope for the ambitious global goal of safeguard of our land and sea by but this be just the start and the test will be whether these safeguard be indeed in place in constituency such as aylesbury across the country of course the nppf rightly contain protection for the good and most versatile agricultural land as well but ultimately protect and strengthen agricultural land mean support the farmer who steward and manage it have speak to many farmer in my constituency for instance during brilliant visit to ledburn farm on the ascott estate producer of the wheat for my kid weetabix know that farmer have be under great pressure in recent year from weather event disease economic volatility brexit rise energy cost rise rural crime you name it but also know that they work incredibly hard to keep put food on our table may commend the hon lady for bring forward this matter she be absolutely right to highlight the issue affect farmer she may not be aware that my constituency be one of the few area of rich agricultural land that can produce three potato crop year it be essential that we ensure that farmer can and do make the most of the possibility not simply in lush strangford but in aylesbury and across this great united kingdom do the hon lady agree that we need the department for environment food and rural affairs to engage with grassroots farming and to support farmer thereby ensure that we increase food security in the united kingdom while protect our agricultural land the minister be in his place and there be no well person to do just that agree that support smallholder farmer be absolutely essential there be too much to say in the time we have available tonight but will pull out three particularly important way to help set up our farmer for success first and foremost we have to ensure the long term financial sustainability of british farming the environment land management scheme have be unclear difficult to navigate and poorly tailor to different context in the case of ledburn farm to the heavy clay land as result the uptake have be low but farmer remain in need of that support and we have to find way to make it easy to access equally farmer be forge ahead and find way to diversify their income but there be much more we can do to support that for example by make it much easy to change the use of exist farm building or to develop low grade agricultural land if it create renewable energy source or affordable housing for farm worker secondly we have to promote and support farmer to roll out sustainable farming practice that address challenge such as soil erosion and low land productivity for example by support the farmer cluster that have become increasingly prevalent across buckinghamshire which bring together farmer to help explore good practice and to share idea for enhance natural habitat on their land thirdly we need to invest in the next generation of british farmer this mean ensure that we give the profession the status that it deserve in the first place and that we start educate child about it at very young age that mean create pathway into the farming sector for example through invest in specialist technical education and expand agriculture apprenticeship it mean make it not just attractive but affordable to live in rural community and to pursue career in farming particularly in place such as buckinghamshire where there be far too little affordable rural housing and service as result the pull to town be too strong in short we can put all the necessary protection in place for quality agricultural land and be confident that we will but without thriving farming sector to safeguard that land they will have little impact my constituency have suffer from the absence of coherent strategy for our land where and how we protect it where and how we use it and where and how we develop it recent government have leave nature deplete farmer deeply uncertain at good and out of business at bad and community frustrate by haphazard house building without access to green space infrastructure or service under this government the future have to look different and we have to start with clear principle alongside the nppf the new land use framework will surely help to ensure that we get the right balance between food production nature and economic growth we need more predictability of course external shock will happen but the role of the government be to be steadying force it be great that we have get to work quickly on the first step whether plan reform or set up great british energy and think we can look forward to steady focus roll out finally we need good deal of pragmatism and an acceptance that get the right balance between development and environmental protection be not easy and there will be compromise but it be necessary we have to find way both to build the home and infrastructure of the future and to protect and regenerate our agricultural and nature rich land because ultimately one can not exist without the other rise order it be highly unusual for other member to contribute to an adjournment debate because it be conversation between the lead member and the minister believe that you have seek permission but it be still highly unusual so assume that the contribution will be short before the minister respond thank you very much for your permission to speak in this debate madam deputy speaker want to support the representation from my hon friend the member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith because some of the thing that she raise be also relevant to my constituency and those across the country as my hon friend say the case for more genuinely affordable home be clear that be accept in my community as much as in hers if not more so as so many people struggle in the private sector and house price spiral due to the pressure of unregulated short term holiday let drive by many people huge and understandable desire to enjoy the delight of margate broadstairs and ramsgate we need new home have speak to far too many people in their and beyond who live in their childhood bedroom sometimes with partner they be desperate to be able to start their life in home of their own but they be price out of their own community we also desperately need the infrastructure to support the family who will live in those home and we need to protect and enhance not only the nature that we love but the nature that be essential to our own economy wellbeing and future come here to change the rule madam deputy speaker although of course observe the one that you enforce in this house it be clear that the current rule do not serve our need for home or our need to protect and enhance nature they do not enable the right infrastructure to be build nor do they effectively help we identify and protect our vital farmland those who protect the status quo in this argument be condemn our country to failure those who think that any of these four element home farming nature or infrastructure include energy should drop off the list of our priority do not understand the importance of shape our community to benefit our resident now and for the long term nature be not just nice to have it be fundamental to we in achieve our economic health and climate goal in thanet people come to see and enjoy our natural world damage nature where it be vital part of the economy be short sighted and dangerous we also have some of the most productive farmland in the whole of the uk yet the exist planning rule do not protect it from speculation and development access to nature be prove to enhance health and wellbeing and the success of previous labour governments in create access to nature for everyone be some of our proud achievement furthermore responsible custodianship of our natural environment especially precious ecosystem be vital to capturing sequester and reduce carbon emission the sixth carbon budget predict that by we will need to remove megatonne of year via nature base solution which be more than double what we do today that include wetland woodland and peatland which be both beautiful and useful this labour government be elect on mandate to transform we into clean energy superpower by and to restore and protect of nature by we can not achieve those goal under the current rule that be why look forward to we publish land use framework that will help we to decide what we use land for and help we to shape our community and our country to meet our ambition to be somewhere with affordable home to rent or own and run affordable sustainable food affordable secure home grow clean energy decent public service and our beloved countryside provide we with the peace and climate security we all need my thank to my hon friend the member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith for secure today debate deliver such

government central mission for economic growth my hon friend the member for aylesbury raise the important issue of planning reform the government be determined to transform the planning system to ensure win win for house building and for nature nature recovery be top priority alongside the need to overhaul the planning system grow the economy and reach net zero it be not matter of choose one

environmental improvement plan our review will ensure that it be fit for purpose to deliver on our legally bind environment act target and our international commitment to protect of england land and sea by so this debate be extremely timely and will seek to address and respond to the point raise to restore nature we need to create restore and connect wildlife rich habitat at scale reduce pressure on specie include from pollution and climate change and take target action to recover specific specie the government will deliver for nature work in partnership with civil society community and business to restore and protect our natural world work with farmer and landowner to deliver nature recovery will be crucial which be why we be fully commit to the environmental land management scheme would the minister be keen to meet some of my constituent who be threaten by the action of edf and hinkley point which wish to create salt marsh on land that be currently farm in north somerset that be cause huge amount of distress to people locally include young sophie cole whom meet this weekend and who have just start on her path as young farmer she be and she and all the villager in kingston seymour be very keen to make sure that the minister understand the tension between the creation of salt marsh at the behest of hinkley and their natural desire to carry on farming that have take place for hundred of year would be happy to learn more about the issue that the hon lady have raise the government will optimise elms so that they produce the right outcome for all farmer while deliver food security and nature recovery in just and equitable way we will confirm plan for the roll out of scheme and our wide approach as soon as possible elms include the sustainable farming incentive countryside stewardship and landscape recovery will contribute to the biodiversity target at scale by support nature friendly farming and create and restore wildlife rich habitat they will also help to restore and improve the condition of protect site include site of special scientific interest from this year elm agreement be expect to bring or maintain up to hectare of eligible sssi habitat in england under favourable management and to create or restore up to hectare of wildlife rich habitat in addition to up to hectare of peat and woodland by in addition to the action that we will take to recover nature by create and restore habitat we will take action to effectively protect wildlife rich habitat and specie that protection be crucial as specie be in decline that include important farmland specie such as farmland bird include the turtle dove which have decline in the uk by since however where nature friendly farmer and major partner such as the royal society for the protection of birds the wildlife trust and the national trust have put the right elm measure in the right place we have see increase in scarce farmland bird specie such as chough cirl bunting and stone curlew our work to protect nature will include action to restore our protect site which be vital wildlife haven face increase pressure from climate change pollution and invasive non native specie natural england be work to get protect site into favourable condition that include pilot new power to put in place protect site strategy to deliver improvement in partnership with other and work with the sssi

protect site that include help farmer to secure funding to make management change to improve their condition we will also protect our most beautiful landscape and help our national park and national landscape to become wilder green and more accessible to all as we deliver our commitment to protect of land for nature by the minister talk about partnership and among the key partner in restore nature be of course small family farm have hear speculation that wednesday budget might remove agricultural property relief on inheritance tax of course the minister will not be able to comment on the budget will have to wait until wednesday for that but if somebody be to float such an idea would he combat it the hon gentleman be not go to tempt he will have to wait until wednesday be afraid one of the key criterion for land to contribute to our commitment be protection as area count towards the target should be protect from loss or damage to important biodiversity land contribute to should be secure for long enough to secure good biodiversity outcome generally for at least year some area include those under intensive farming be not suitable for but our approach recognise that nature friendly land us may be able to play role in support our goal it be disappointing that the good work do by wildfowle club across this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland be not often mention they rent and own salt marsh they own land as well and they manage they so that wildlife and plant life can blossom it be do in partnership with landowner natural england and many other will the minister recognise the good work that wildfowling club do and their contribution to well life of course join the hon gentleman in recognise the role of wildfowling club and many other who play an important role in the countryside the government also place great importance on our agricultural land and food production the national planning policy framework set out how the good and most versatile agricultural land should be reflect in planning policy and decision the framework be clear that where significant development of agricultural land be necessary area of poor quality land should be prefer to those of high quality meet our ambitious target on nature restoration alongside our priority on food security and accelerate to net zero will require careful thought about how we use our land which be why the forthcoming land use framework for england will consider cross governmental issue such as energy and food security and how we can expand nature rich habitat such as wetland peat bog and forest the un biodiversity summit be currently under way in colombia where the importance of biodiversity and ensure that we achieve our national target and international commitment will once again be in the spotlight the government have also recently appoint ruth davis as the uk first envoy for nature and she will champion our ambition to put nature at the heart of our foreign policy and help we to deliver our commitment for nature recovery finish by thank my hon friend the member for aylesbury for secure today debate look forward to work closely with she and other to ensure that we begin to make real progress on the government priority of nature recovery and boost our food security question put and agree to house adjourn
