for woman and service provider single sex space must be protect and this be personal to before be elect to this place run woman refuge in the north east for woman and child flee domestic violence know how important to survivor it be and always be to have single sex space base on biology place of safety after trauma time in sanctuary that allow they therapeutic support heal from unimaginable male violence and fear remember how hard countless campaigner have to fight over many decade to get any single sex provision at all in order to create woman refuge and rape crisis centre later remember how hard it be to convince commissioner that young homeless woman try to heal from terrifying act of cruelty should not be leave in mixed sex accommodation will continue to fight for that provision to ensure that woman safety woman privacy and woman dignity be always protect this government will continue as before work to protect single sex space base on biological sex now with the add clarity of this ruling and we will continue our wide work with commitment and compassion to protect all those who need it right across society this be government who will support the right of woman and tran people now and always this be government who will support the right of all people with protect characteristic now and always this be government who will support the right of our most vulnerable now and always on that there be no change to announce dignity and respect for all now and always but this be judgment long in the making it begin in when scottish ministers issue guidance on the definition of woman in the eye of the gender representation on public boards scotland act that guidance state that woman in that act bear the same meaning as woman in the equality act and include tran woman with gender recognition certificate for women scotland challenge that guidance say that sex in the equality act mean biological sex so that trans woman with gender recognition certificate be man for the purpose of the act the case be appeal to the supreme court and last week the court rule that sex in the equality act mean biological sex this mean that person will be consider as their biological sex for the purpose of the equality act regardless of whether or not they have gender recognition certificate know that the woman who bring this challenge have not always be treat with the respect they deserve this government believe in freedom of speech and in the fundamental right to protest but in no way do that extend to criminal damage there can be no excuse for defaced statue of feminist icon no excuse for threat and no excuse for harassment such act seek to drag down the debate away from common sense and the sensible view hold by the majority of the british public that woman need single sex space that those space should be protect and that we can protect those space while treat trans people with respect as well as such the certainty that this judgment bring be welcome now it be time to move forward there be now need to ensure that this ruling be clear across range of setting from healthcare and prison to sport and single sex support group the equality and human rights commission as britain equality regulator be work quickly to issue an update statutory code of practice to reflect this judgment and look forward to review that code of practice in due course alongside these update our work to protect single sex space across society continue in earnest because for far too long under the conservative government single sex space be anything but and nowhere be that clear than in our hospital year after year the conservatives pledge to close mixed sex ward and yet year after year their use not only persist but grow massively year after year often in their most vulnerable moment woman be deny the privacy and dignity they deserve time after time conservative ministers include the now leader of the opposition come to this house and tour television studio tell the public that they be protect single sex space in our hospital the truth be very different because as last year datum tell we the use of mixed sex ward rise by more than in year under the last tory government there be no well example of rhetoric divorce from reality and of party playing politic with the safety of woman and we will never let they forget it by contrast this government will protect woman ward and nhs england will soon publish guidance on how trans patient should be accommodate in clinical setting we will end the practice of mixed sex ward once and for all it be not just in our nhs that we will act on behalf of woman in prison we will continue to protect woman safety with single sex accommodation in woman sport have always back integrity and fairness biology matter for competitive sport and sporting body have issue rule to reflect that in our prison in our hospital in sport and in whole host of other space what be true before the ruling remain true after the ruling this government protect safe space for woman under the equality act for too many year we have see the heat dial up in this debate by the conservatives there be no real action to protect woman space while under their watch the use of mixed sex ward increase an epidemic of violence against woman and girl spread across the country and woman health be neglect this labour government will deliver for woman through our plan for change drive down waiting list month after month tackle misogyny throughout society and once and for all deliver justice for survivor of violence against woman and girl know that many trans people will be worry in the wake of the supreme court ruling so want to provide reassurance here and now that trans people will continue to be protect we will deliver full trans inclusive ban on conversion practice we will work to equalise all exist strand of hate crime and we will review adult gender identity service so that all tran people get the high quality care they deserve the law to protect trans people from discrimination and harassment will remain in place and trans people will still be protect on the basis of gender reassignment protect characteristic write into labour equality act this government will offer trans people the dignity that too often they be deny by the conservatives too often trans people be convenient punchbag and the butt of joke make in this place by the conservatives culminate rather shamefully in the previous prime minister stand at this dispatch box try to score cheap laugh from his back benchers at the expense of vulnerable people by contrast this government be clear that trans people deserve safety opportunity and respect this verdict be about clarity and coherence in the eye of the law but the supreme court judge deliver along with that verdict vital reminder this be not about the triumph of one group at the expense of another it be not about winner or loser and it be not about we or they that be the message want to reinforce today in this house everyone in our society deserve dignity and respect those value be not and never will be zero sum battle dignity and respect for all those be the value that lift we up and set we free those be the value that define and distinguish any modern and compassionate society those be the value that this government will do everything to promote and protect now and
