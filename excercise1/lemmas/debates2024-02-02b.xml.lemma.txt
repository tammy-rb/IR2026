beg to move that the bill be now read second time in this place our nation parliament change come in many form sometimes it be the clamour of the picket line the lobby group or members own interest sometimes it come in the shape of an mp constituency surgery and the quiet work man man who know what be right and wrong who seize injustice and internal fury and propel it to this place to be remedie he fight not for himself he know the barrier that he face but for every man woman and every one of we as we face the cruel certainty of age and age discrimination in the workplace the man be stephen horne be proud that he be my constituent and be proud today to speak to stephen bill stand with he on tackle the endemic age discrimination in our society the bill aim to address the provision at the heart of the nation challenge jo gideon stoke on trent central con support my hon friend bill as she know the protection of other characteristic gender race and religion for example be generally observe in employment law do she agree that pervasive age discrimination be big issue that we need to tackle as her bill will do in small but important way mrs elphicke my hon friend be exactly right age discrimination be absolutely pervasive in our society it be such common experience that one in three people report have experience it we must tackle that injustice the bill repeal paragraph of schedule to the equality act which allow workplace benefit to be remove from work person solely by reason of their come to statutory pensionable age be pleased to introduce the bill under the ten minute rule last year and be pleased to bring it back today with strong support from so many member across the house who like believe that we urgently need to tackle this issue people in their and commonly experience discrimination because of their age and of those incident be at work accord to the centre for ageing better one in five employer believe that age discrimination occur in their organisation and many argue that ageism be key barrier for people age to who want to return to or remain in their workplace paragraph allow active discrimination under the law and so open the door to other form of indirect and unconscious bias discrimination that be well explore by the women and equalities committee which say that it be clear that there be prejudice unconscious bias and casual ageism in the workplace as well as inadequate challenge to current practice stephen be train driver with eurotunnel he help to build the tunnel before it first open year ago and he have drive train since the very first go through the tunnel when he reach the age of his boss decide to remove his workplace benefit relate to income protection and long term sickness and his health insurance that put stephen at disadvantage compare with other worker he be do the same job at as he do at but now he do not get the same money worth or the same term and condition in his contract of employment in simple term stephen do not get pay and condition equal to those of young worker solely by reason of his age that be not right if stephen fall ill he can not get the same access to speedy private healthcare that other people in his company get include for workplace injury which mean that he might be out of the workplace for long if heaven forbid he die his wife marsha would no long have the compensatory insurance through death in service benefit that another worker family would be entitle to yet stephen be do exactly the same job as he be before he reach retirement age when look into stephen case be shock to discover that such age discrimination be legal the equality act be suppose to provide protection for old people against age discrimination age be as my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central jo gideon rightly say protect characteristic and it need to be treat as such that exception in the act mean that stephen and worker up and down the land face discrimination and similar issue with term and condition we need to tackle that issue because people be stay in the workplace long and because it be unfair and wrong it need to be tackle in this place through change in the law have have discussion with company about why they do not just do the right thing why they do not change this unfair practice and why they do not look after all their worker well the answer that have have be simple they will not do that until we in this parliament say that they must because they do not want to have to pay more by offer those term and condition the bottom line be that they do not want old worker like stephen that be not right and it be not something this country can afford either people be work until much old age that have become more acute as the government have change the pensionable age stephen bill seek to put right the situation for every old worker in this country by change the law on workplace benefit so that old people be treat the same as other in any other part of the employment relationship we know why this matter there be time when pregnant woman have to quit her job and leave the workplace indeed there be time when woman be not welcome in many workplace there be time when woman be not give pay maternity leave man be not give pay paternity leave and woman would not get job if they be of childbeare age we have address that through parliament over decade now employer find that retain woman in the workplace indeed have they at the very top level in the boardroom benefit not just mother but business business can now retain the vital skill knowledge and commitment of female worker and that need to happen in relation to old worker too old worker have skill and knowledge gain over many year in the workplace treat old worker fairly will encourage they to stay and benefit the company they work for remember time when employer use to say that woman do not need to work get the same bonus as man or be offer overtime because man need those opportunity in order to feed their family we outlaw that because equal pay at work matter and equal opportunity at work matter too that apply every bit as much whether it be young or old worker do the job another excuse that be give be that cover old people become more expensive for everyone because the premium for the company go up that is of course absurd apply that logic would it be okay to exclude from employment benefit people who have have heart condition cancer bad back disability or chronic condition on the basis that the insurance might go up of course not it would not be lawful and it should not be lawful for that to happen simply because of someone age we have say in other case that take away someone work benefit be discriminatory and wrong and it be discriminatory and wrong to do so simply because they have get old that be something that none of we can influence or affect it will happen to we all even in this place and as we have hear recently even in government people term and condition and severance pay differ depend on the age at which they take their role or responsibility it be time for we to amend this great injustice stephen know that the challenge that he face in change the mind of his boss be enormous and there be no indication that they be prepared to do that however know from speak to business that there be thing that the government can do beyond change the law to ensure that this injustice be address that could include ensure there be compensatory payment to give equivalence on an equal pay basis to people who do not have access to the same pay and condition as other that mean make it unlawful for those offer insurance to have that kind of discriminatory condition which we should do this be such an important time for our nation as we look for everyone to contribute and require people to work in old life it be essential that we put in place the right law protection and framework so that whatever people want to do in old age they be treat fairly and equally that be the reason that stephen have ask the debate stand adjourn standing order no order that the debate be resume on friday march
