thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for raise this issue and for present his argument in the way that he do we have speak about this case on number of occasion so he will know that take responsibility for make sure that we make the correct decision on arap when be on the opposition front bench where the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois be now sit raise concern about the functioning of the arap scheme in office we have make change to the scheme to make sure that it function well which will come to the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain mention communication and believe the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis quote the secretary of state comment on the triples review but will address the issue raise by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green in the first instance very much appreciate the right hon member advocacy for the individual involve and his passion for afghan resettlement in general he be absolutely right to say that we owe an obligation to the people who serve alongside uk force what we have do with the arap scheme be implement as nation under the last government and this one probably the most generous afghan relocation scheme of any of the ally that serve in afghanistan and we have draw set of eligibility criterion that with the exception of the triples which will come to in moment have broadly remain the same under this government and the precede government hear the right hon gentleman concern about element of that which will seek to address as former minister he will know that will not be able to address the individual circumstance of the case without permission so will make some more general remark in respect of that individual case however hope the right hon gentleman will not mind my saying that we have meet previously on this matter and very much understand and appreciate his ongoing engagement have to be honest with he and say that when he and first speak about this case and be brief on it too be surprise by the decision that be make that be why undertake to take it back to the department and to check on the eligibility of the case which do have do that be confident that the official have follow the publish criterion and apply they correctly to the evidence provide the decision be appropriate and should stand should also be clear that there be no plan to ask to expand the criterion which be implement by the previous government do however recognise the context of this particular matter and be happy to take up the right hon gentleman challenge to see whether exceptional route may be available do not want to give he false hope be not certain there will be such route but have speak to he previously about this know the seriousness of the matter he raise and be happy to see whether we could look at additional opportunity to provide support in this case when it come to the publish criterion for arap we must be absolutely clear about eligibility and it be my job as the minister responsible for afghan resettlement to make sure that decision be make correctly against the publish eligibility criterion where decision have be make an individual have access to review and where there be concern over an individual security while that review be ongoing especially circumstance in which the life and safety of that individual be threaten there be the ability to request an expedite decision entirely understand where the right hon gentleman be go with that argument under the criterion in the scheme we inherit from the previous government which we have continue we have make the decision with the exception of the triples to keep the eligibility decision the same let turn to the triples which the right hon gentleman raise believe that the quote of the secretary of state when in opposition be in relation to the very concern situation believe it be concern to he and to when in opposition that decision be make in respect of the afghan special force the triples that be inconsistent with the evidence that be be provide we back and call for the triples review which be initiate by my predecessor in the previous government phase of that review have now complete and we have achieve an overturn rate of around write ministerial statement on that be publish think last month should the right hon gentleman want to refer to the full detail in that work we interrogate the datum that be available the record keeping of that period be not good enough as have say from the dispatch box number of time since take office as part of that trawl we discover information in relation to top up payment which previously have be exclude from the criterion because they do not constitute the relationship with the uk government that would have create eligibility our belief be that the way those top up payment be apply may now constitute relationship that need to be re examined so phase of the triples review which will be the final phase of the review be look at top up payment it be right to do that because there be clear point in the case raise by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green be very happy to try to see what be available to support it feel very deeply that we need to honour our obligation to those people who serve alongside our force from the afghan translator and interpreter who live in the constituency represent to the people who fight and in some case die alongside our force the arap scheme be generous scheme but it be not intend at its point of initiation or now to cover all afghans who fight in that conflict over year it be design to support those who we can evidence have close connection to uk force often define by contractual or payment relationship in blunt plain english term where sizeable commitment have be make that draw line for some individual who be employ by the afghan national army the afghan government and element of the security structure that the afghan government have at that time for which eligibility be not create despite their role the taliban regime have create chaos instability and terror through many community in afghanistan since our departure that be why as government we be try to accelerate and deliver the afghan scheme the hon member for north east fife mention communication that be entirely right it be something have be raise since become minister we will introduce from the autumn new series of communication design to help people understand where their application be in the process the new performance indicator will kick in from september time roughly in the autumn and that will seek to help people to understand where they be in the process there be concern around understanding for how long case will be deal with also hope the performance indicator will have time bind target to help people be able to rate the performance of the ministry of defence certainly when the defence secretary publish his statement on the afghan resettlement scheme at the end of last year he make the case that we need to complete our obligation and bring the scheme to close and it be our objective to do so
