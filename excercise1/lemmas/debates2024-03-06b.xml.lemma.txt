oral answers to questions scotland the secretary of state be ask financial settlement for scotland what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the financial settlement for scotland last weekend scotland once again show the world that we can host fantastic sporting event with the world athletics indoor championships hold in glasgow offer my congratulation to everyone involve and especially to medal winner jemma reekie from ayrshire and josh kerr from edinburgh who be the first scottish man to win gold medal in those championship in over year also congratulate the scottish rugby team who thank to their recent victory over england have now win the calcutta cup four time in row it would have be five in row but covid get in the way laughter contrary to what we hear from the scottish national party the scottish government be well fund this uk government have provide record block grant average billion year with an additional billion across the last three fiscal event scotland also continue to benefit from the barnett formula under which the scottish government receive around more funding per person than equivalent spending across the united kingdom will the secretary of state explain how his government million cut to scotland capital budget over the next three year will impact the provision of infrastructure include road hospital school new home digital connectivity and the economic growth we need to escape the recession into which the tories have drag we it be nice to see that the hon lady and her colleague have turn up for work today even if that be in defiance of the deputy leader of the snp who think they should not bother come let be clear on resource spending and the capital budget the scottish government be able to divert their resource spending for capital infrastructure investment and they can also borrow to enhance capital investment if they so choose the secretary of state be correct that the block grant from the uk conservative government to scotland be the high it have ever be despite that just last week the snp green government push through their tax and axe budget in scotland do my right hon friend agree that the nationalist have get the wrong priority for scotland by cut service while increase income tax rate for anyone earn more than agree with my hon friend and add far that the scottish government six tax band as oppose to the uk government three tax band be really hold scotland back call the shadow minister while the snp and the tories argue about the financial settlement between the two government they do agree on two thing first that work people should pay the price of this economic mess by raise tax to sky high level and secondly at least until today that oil and gas giant earn record profit should not face proper windfall tax although it now seem as if the snp might be the only people hold out on that position who do the secretary of state support the scottish tory leader who be stand up in holyrood today attack an extension of the windfall tax or the chancellor who we understand be about to announce exactly that my position have always be clear believe that the energy profit levy on the excess profit cause by putin illegal war in ukraine be the right thing for the government to do to give support to people in the cost of living crisis call the snp spokesperson it start so well and agree with the secretary of state about the calcutta cup be there to witness an historic occasion and about the world athletics indoor championships in glasgow play rugby with jemma reekie cousin for many year and send my congratulation to they however everything from that point on from both side of the house have be absolute nonsense at time when many scot be struggle to pay their energy or shopping bill due to the rapid inflation that the secretary of state government have preside over and with inflation in the public sector run even higher his government have cut the scottish government funding in real term again commons library research show that the scottish block grant will be at its low level of uk government spending since the start of devolution as the secretary of state count down the week to his departure be he proud of his legacy that be an easy one to answer mr speaker as be very proud of my legacy rather like win four calcutta cup have win in court with the scottish government four time and there be any number of thing would like to list for my legacy importantly the scottish government receive record block of billion and record barnett consequential on top of that spend in scotland be high per person than the uk average so that equate to an extra billion have no idea we should all just be very grateful for the largesse of the secretary of state but do that largesse extend to capital funding capital funding to the scottish parliament have not just be cut but slash by on his watch that money could have be use to invest in hospital school and infrastructure and it be about to be fritter away by the chancellor on sicken pre election bribe that precisely no one will buy will he finally accept that it be his government bust or bust austerity that be drive public service to the edge and do he support tax cut at time when even tory voter know that increase public investment be require this be nonsense austerity be not thing under this government not thing at all laughter no absolutely not departmental spending this be the point that the snp do not acknowledge throughout this parliament have grow by on average that be the simple truth international relations what discussion he have have with the scottish government and cabinet colleague on the scottish government international relation policy have have frequent and recent discussion with the foreign secretary on the scottish government international relation policy foreign affair be reserve to the united kingdom government we have be clear to the scottish government that they must respect that first may associate myself with the secretary of state comment about the scottish victory in the calcutta cup do the right hon gentleman share my concern that these recent foray into international relation by the snp be not only inappropriate because it be reserved matter but potentially damaging both to important relationship between scotland two government and critically to uk foreign policy at time when international tension be at height we have not see since the cold war agree with the hon lady it be important that the united kingdom government speak with one voice and the united kingdom be see to speak with one voice on foreign affair note that angus robertson have produce another independence document this week on foreign affair and defence and there be lot of nonsense in there the scottish government want to join the nato nuclear alliance but they want to get rid of the nuclear deterrent they want to join the eu but not the euro they want to have scottish spy agency some be refer to it as the sleekit service with agent head across europe in their bulletproof motorhome it be all nonsense and complete waste of taxpayer money promote trade with northern ireland whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague on promote trade between scotland and northern ireland be pleased to say that have have discussion with the secretary of state for northern ireland about maximise trade link now that the northern ireland executive have be restore what be more the uk government have commit to establish the east west council which will identify opportunity for deepen connection between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom include the scope for extend the northern ireland investment zone benefit to stranraer and cairnryan will the minister ensure that business body in scotland be fully aware of for example the new intertrade uk body so that business can prosper between northern ireland and scotland importantly will he ensure that people can see the improvement in business trade flow between scotland and northern ireland in six month time as compare with six month ago as set out in the command paper the uk government be work to establish intertrade uk which will fulfil our pledge to grow the economy by ensure that business large and small can make the most of the east west trading opportunity implement the windsor framework and the command paper be the government priority and we will provide an update in close time cost of live what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in scotland what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in scotland what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in scotland we prioritise bring inflation down which be the key to reduce cost of living pressure we deliver on the prime minister promise by more than halve it in addition the uk government support household with package worth billion or on average per household across the united kingdom include in scotland family in my homeland be reel from the cost of living crisis as both the tory uk government and the snp scottish government have jointly load they with the high tax burden in year do the minister agree that it be time both government stop go round in circle leave the dance and clear the floor for labour government to sort out their sorry mess do not agree with the hon gentleman conclusion thank to this government million worker in scotland benefit from back in their pocket thank to the national insurance cut in january however do agree with he in not agree with the snp government approach to tax make scotland the highest tax part of the united kingdom scottish rail fare be set to rise by next month this eye water fare hike will hit scots hard during cost of live crisis and push scotland rail service into spiral of decline do the minister agree that we need affordable fare to help people through the cost of live crisis and encourage more people to travel by train certainly agree that we should do all we can to encourage people to travel by train the scottish government approach to scotrail might discourage that be happy to meet the hon member to discuss that far recent finding from the trussell trust have reveal that of people claim universal credit in scotland have fall into debt because they could not pay essential bill do the minister agree that the people of scotland and the people of britain should not be make to pay for snp and tory failure in there be million few people in absolute poverty after housing cost than there be in include few child this government be certainly take lot of action to address poverty and particularly in work poverty but agree that make scotland the highest tax part of the uk do not help with that do the minister agree that put up taxis as the snp be do at present will do nothing to help with the cost of living do he far agree that if it continue on that trajectory more and more scot will want to leave and come to place such as carlisle where of course they will be very welcome due to the snp tax rise in scotland anyone earn more than will pay more income tax than those live in england from my own experience represent borders constituency see increase evidence of people choose to live south of the border rather than in the high tax scottish jurisdiction in my discussion with science technology engineering and math business find that they be find it increasingly difficult to recruit in scotland because of the aggressive high tax policy of the snp call the shadow secretary of state regardless of what the chancellor announce today we be in the high tax raise parliament in history which be consequence of the minister government failure over year ordinary hard work scots do not cause this economic crisis the government do but they be be make to pay for it there have be tory tax rise since the last election and the average family be much bad off as result do the minister agree with the institute for fiscal studies that even after today budget the overall tax burden on work people will still reach record level clearly will not speculate on what the chancellor will announce shortly remind the hon gentleman that million worker in scotland have benefit from go back into their pocket thank to the change to national insurance that have already be announce in relation to the hon member wide point about the tax burden we should not forget the huge intervention that the government make to support worker family community and business during the pandemic as consequence we be have to repay that but that save job and many business from go under during the covid pandemic regardless of what the chancellor say today work people will still be pay much high tax burden at the end of this parliament and it will reach record level shockingly the tax burden in scotland be even high anyone in scotland earn more than year will pay more income tax after the snp vote for yet another tax rise on work people that mean we be in the absurd position in scotland of the snp raise taxis on nurse and teacher while oppose labour plan for an extended windfall tax on the oil and gas giant we even hear that the leader of the scottish conservatives threaten to resign last night on potentially another turn from the chancellor on the windfall tax do the minister accept that the good thing to happen now would be for this circus to be bring for an end and for the prime minister to call the election as say will not speculate on the content of the budget but when the election come scotland voter will have clear choice party who will stand up for scotland place in strong united kingdom or the scottish national party who want another referendum be unclear what the labour party have to offer farm gate price whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague on farm gate price for farmer and crofter in scotland we want all farmer to get fair price for their product the government have commit to tackle contractual unfairness in the agrifood supply chain we will use the power in the agriculture act whenever necessary at the national farmers union conference the prime minister announce that the uk farm to fork summit will be an annual event that will help to strengthen joint working by government and external partner to support prosperous agrifood sector the minister should be aware that his colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs have recently conclude consultation on contractual relationship in the fresh produce industry at time when of dairy farmer doubt that they will continue in business into will he impress on his

of allegation of impropriety in public life for his department work on strengthen the union our union be strong interruption yes it be scotland contribution to our united kingdom be beyond doubt and this government commitment to scotland be without question from freeport and investment zone to the record block grant and billion for the city and region growth deal we deliver for scotland snp mps

general election do he also agree that member elect to this house should turn up and do their job agree with the hon lady three year ago on march we have debate in this house on precisely the subject of this question at the time be concern that nicola sturgeon government be cover up interference in the complaint process against the first minister since then in defiance of the information commissioner and of court order they have continue to cover up will the cabinet secretary look at whether the ministerial code and the civil service code have be break my right hon friend should write to the cabinet secretary and ask he to do that very thing marine energy sector support what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of support for the marine energy

the large tidal energy farm anywhere in the world and it be support by eu funding through the european marine energy centre this come after edinburgh university report find that the uk government could save hundred of million of pound by bring forward the development of tidal by year if it work more closely with its eu partner it be clear that the eu role in this in europe and around scotland be very important so if scotland be well together with anyone be it not well together with the eu and its investment in tidal what load of nonsense scotland be much well serve by be part of the united kingdom and we will continue to support all renewable energy sector include tidal cross border nhs provision wait times whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague and the scottish government on wait time for cross border nhs provision the government recognise the invaluable job that all nhs worker do see that every day of the week in my constituency in the scottish borders that be why the secretary of state for health and social care have write to the scottish government about work together to reduce patient waiting time we continue to be open to explore that far have lady constituent who suffer from rare and dangerous condition call subglottic stenosis only one clinic have the expertise to treat the condition and it be in london yet our local health board be refuse to refer she it say that it can offer another treatment but it be think to be less safe and possibly not very effective what step be the government take to ensure that patient regardless of which side of the border they live on get the good possible treatment be regularly remind particularly as an mp for the borders of the need for healthcare to benefit people on either side of the border particularly through cross border work with the nhs local people in the borders often get treatment fast and more easily because of that sadly the hon member have highlight real problem with scotland nhs thank to

fleet do he agree that since the uk become an independent coastal state the scottish fleet and those who negotiate on its behalf include snp scottish government ministers and their official have far strong voice in these annual negotiation than if the snp have its way and we go back into the eu common fishery policy my hon friend be great champion of the fishing industry and completely agree with he we now come to prime minister question we be join today in the gallery by the speaker of the supreme council of the kyrgyz republic prime minister the prime minister be ask engagements if he will list his official engagement for wednesday march this morning have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house include listen to the chancellor budget statement shall have further such meeting later today the uk use to be world leader in psilocybin research but despite the call of the home affairs committee lead researcher charity veteran organisation and the royal college of psychiatrists we have shamefully fall behind on breakthrough treatment for condition such as post traumatic stress disorder and depression cause misery to million of people in our country can the prime minister explain why this policy remain the responsibility of home office that can not give it the attention it deserve and why it be okay that american canadian and australian patient can access treatment that british patient can not completely sympathise and understand why people suffer from distressing condition will want to seek the good possible treatment available and thank the hon lady for raise the issue we be committed to ensure that the uk be world lead jurisdiction for pharmaceutical clinical and other medical research and we have ask the advisory council on the misuse of drugs to review barrier to legitimate medical research involve control drug such as psilocybin be pleased to tell the hon lady that our response to the council recommendation will be publish as soon as possible my constituency have long and proud history of farming with generation of the same family help to feed our nation not since world war two have we be so aware of how important food security be to our national security so will the prime minister update the house on what his government be do to support our fantastic farmer as set out at the nfu conference just couple of week ago we will always back british farmer for continue to produce fantastic food we be accelerate that plan with the large package of grant ever indeed one of the new scheme open just today support farmer with up to towards the purchase of new equipment and technology our scheme in england be all about more choice not less unlike labour in wales we will never introduce top down arbitrary target that damage farm income damage our food security and take farmer back to square one call the leader of the opposition three year ago sarah everard be walk home when she be abduct and murder by serve police officer who should have be trust to keep she safe as father can not imagine the pain her parent her family and her friend be go through in this difficult anniversary week lady angiolini report expose the appalling failure in police vet and in misconduct process and be very troubled by its conclusion that there be nothing to stop another couzens operate in plain sight how can that be the case three year on from this horrendous crime can first say that be sure all member of the house will have be think about sarah everard in recent week it be as the right hon and learn gentleman say an absolutely shocking case and the abuse of power in particular be appalling that be why we take action quickly to strengthen police vetting and strengthen the rule for root out officer who be not fit to serve and conduct the large ever screening of all serve officer and staff we be now ensure that any officer who have be charge with crime will be suspend from duty automatically until their case be conclude and we will thoroughly consider all the report recommendation and respond in full the prime minister mention vet and just want to press he on that because serious failure in police vetting be raise in independent report as long ago as and that be why labour have be argue for mandatory national vetting standard that would stop anybody with history of domestic abuse or sexual offending be allow to join the police in the first place why be mandatory national vetting standard not already in place it be vital for public confidence that those who be not fit to wear the badge be root out of the police and not able to join in the first place that be why the college of policing update its statutory code on vetting and that happen quickly in addition the police inspectorate carry out rapid inspection of all force progress against the previous finding and in addition to that an entire check against the national police database be carry out for all serve officer and staff be obviously very familiar with code in criminal justice system this be too serious for that there be world of difference between code and bind mandatory standard which do not have legal effect and that should trouble member across the house couzens history of sexual offending stretch back many year on four occasion despite allegation of indecent exposure he be not sack we know that indecent exposure be gateway to more horrific crime as be tragically show to be the case not only in sarah everard case but in that of libby squire but it be not treat with the seriousness require the angiolini report recommend review all indecent exposure allegation against serve officer in order to identify investigate and remove those officer from service give the obvious urgency of this recommendation can the prime minister give categorical assurance that it will be implement immediately the home secretary address this specifically when he make his statement indecent exposure just like any other kind of sexually motivated crime be abhorrent and we expect police chief to take it extremely seriously we fully expect police chief to suspend an officer charge with any kind of sexually motivated crime it be worth point out that in addition to the new power that the home secretary outline about automatic suspension chief constable have exist power to suspend any officer in their force when allegation be make and we fully expect they to use those power do think the recommendation that refer to should be implement urgently and ask the prime minister to look again at that because every day that go past when it be not implement carry risk for victim in these case sarah everard murder should have be watershed moment for police reform for the criminal justice system and for violence against woman and girl but the sad reality be that victim of rape who have the courage and bravery to come forward have just chance of their perpetrator be catch and charge within the year how do the prime minister expect woman to have confidence in the criminal justice system when almost all rapist do not see the inside of courtroom as we acknowledge couple of year ago of course we need to do more to improve rape outcome in the criminal justice system and the rape review action plan be show considerable progress we have already increase the average sentence for rape by third since labour be last in office by the way use power that the labour party vote against in this house thank to our action plan we have see police referral double and charge double and last year there be increase in rape conviction and now rapist will serve every single day of their sentence behind bar the right hon and learn gentleman raise his time at the crown prosecution service but he have not acknowledge that under his tenure rape conviction actually drop the prime minister know that be go to be fact check he also know that support tough sentence really think that victim of violence against woman and girl deserve well than this nonsense from the prime minister it need to be take seriously it be not game we all want more victim to come forward but we have to be honest that unless thing change the criminal justice system will continue to fail they that be why we be committed to introduce specialist rape and sexual offence team in every force to give victim specialist support and confidence that their experience will be investigate properly when will the prime minister commit to do the same we have already implement the rape review action plan the leader of the opposition say that we need to take this seriously and here be the thing that we have do we have end the appalling digital strip search of victim mobile phone we have ensure that there be well use of pre record cross examination we have roll out operation soteria with incredible success across all the nation police force we have significantly increase the number of independent sexual and domestic violence and abuse adviser to up to and there be more specialist training in all police force for these prosecution that be the plan we have already put in place and it be plan that be work to ensure that we keep the woman and girl of this country safe the problem be that the rosy picture the prime minister try to paint of the current criminal justice system be completely at odd with the confidence that many woman currently have in it with the publication of the angiolini report the country deserve to know that we be do all we can to make our country safe for woman that start with what should be the most basic task create safe workplace here in westminster at the moment as everyone in this house know we be fail in that endeavour and we all have duty to change that when will the prime minister make time for the vote on ban from parliament those mp who face allegation of sex offence it be absolutely right that we ensure our community be safe for woman and girl which be why we pass the landmark domestic abuse act why we set up new victim support line why we quadruple funding for victim support and why we be invest in practical thing like cctv and well streetlighting for safe community up and down the country of course there be always more we can do but this government have strong track record on ensure that woman across this country feel safe want the prime minister to know that the people of romford be struggle with ever increase energy price yet provider be make huge profit that run into the hundred of million do he agree that reduction in wholesale price should be pass on to consumer and that stand charge should be bring down will the government hold utility company to account for their action my hon friend be right to highlight the challenge that high energy bill have pose not just to his constituent in romford but to constituent across the country that be why we step in with significant package of support that pay around half of typical household energy bill when price be at their high know my hon friend will join in welcome the fact that the energy price cap be set to fall by almost in april which will bring relief to many family but we must hold company to account that be why we introduce the energy profit levy on the windfall profit cause by an unexpected increase in energy price we be go far to cut people cost by cut their taxis and put more money into their family bank account call the scottish national party leader much to my surprise this morning it have be widely report that the conservative party in scotland be absolutely furious that westminster be about to tax scotland natural resource in order to pay for tax cut in england be the prime minister in danger of turn his colleague into nationalist obviously would not comment on the budget but will say that when be in scotland last week it be crystal clear that there have only ever be one party consistently stand up for the north sea energy industry and it be the scottish conservatives the prime minister know that not to be the case but there be serious point to be make here the conservative party want to use scotland natural resource to pay for tax cut in england and the labour party want to use scotland natural resource to pay for nuclear power station in england the cost of that be up to job scotland wealth resource and job be all game to westminster with the tories on just in the poll in scotland now will the prime minister do we all favour and call general election the hon gentleman claim to be supportive of the north sea energy industry but why have he oppose all the measure that we have take to protect those job in scotland over the past couple of year he talk about tax in scotland and england gently point out to he that thank to the action of the chancellor and this uk government everyone in scotland have receive significant tax cut from january this year in contrast to the chancellor last budget the snp budget put taxis up for work scot scotland be now the high tax capital of the uk but this conservative government be go to keep cut taxis for hard work scot the government be rightly act to compensate properly the horizon victim who be highlight by alan bates legal challenge however there be thousand more sub postmaster across the country who be not prosecute but face financial penalty for bogus shortfall cause they enormous financial and personal distress do the prime minister agree that we should now be do everything possible to do right by all the victim of gross miscarriage of justice clear their name and at last properly financial compensate they my right hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the appalling impact that this miscarriage of justice have have on people mental health as he acknowledge our focus be on deliver justice for the postmaster and that be why we will introduce legislation to overturn conviction and pave the way for the swift payment of compensation thank he for his long stand campaign on mental health on this issue and assure he that the postal minister be closely examine the issue he raise be consider next step and will keep my right hon friend closely inform the prime minister will be aware that the government proposal to deal with the legacy of our troubled past in northern ireland continue to be the subject of scrutiny most recently in the high court ruling in relation to compatibility with our human right obligation many family of victim in northern ireland be deeply disappointed with the lack of co operation by the irish government in relation to murder commit in their jurisdiction or from their jurisdiction in relation to the omagh bomb inquiry for example the irish government have decline to conduct public inquiry on this bad atrocity in our troubled past despite the court urge they to do so will the prime minister continue to press the irish government on the need for they to make available facility to enable the family of innocent victim include in omagh to pursue justice for their love one thank my right hon friend for his question on this important topic which know will be of great interest not only to his constituent but to many other across northern ireland the government have set forward their plan to deal with the legacy of the past and will continue to engage with everyone in northern ireland whatever their view to set out the good way forward can confirm to he that the secretary of state for northern ireland have raise these specific issue directly with the irish government and will continue to do so too speak to the taoiseach about this very matter we would hope to see further co operation on omagh and many other outstanding case that involve irish jurisdiction because like my right hon friend want to give family as much information as possible putin have put the russian economy on total war footing he have increase military spending by to of gdp he claim this month that over new job have be create in the arm industry which now employ an estimate million russians on my recent visit to ukraine have meet government ministers and senior military figure who have express great frustration to about the length of time it be take to develop collaboration in build defence manufacturing capability jointly with uk defence company in ukraine will my right hon friend meet to discuss how we can unblock the bureaucracy and as our ukrainian friend say build the arsenal of the free world together reassure my hon friend that we remain steadfast in our support for ukraine and we will not allow putin to achieve his aim of eradicate ukrainian freedom and democracy our cross government taskforce be work diligently to support the armed force of ukraine and lead uk and ukrainian defence industrial co operation be pleased to say that in december last year we conduct our first successful trade mission to ukraine alongside the uk defence industry the government and uk industry will continue to work hand in glove with our ukrainian ally seize the opportunity for collaboration and bolster our joint defence industry last week the institute for public policy research publish paper state of the north that paper predict that wealth inequality already too large between the north and the south east would increase to nearly per head by the end of this decade do the prime minister accept that his levelling up agenda have fail or do he never want it to succeed on the contrary inequality in our country have actually decline under this conservative government when it come to level up in the north the north have receive some of the high amount of per capita levelling up funding of any region in the country after the hon gentleman last pop up to ask question about our investment in the north do he manage to get an answer about what exactly be the labour party position on would still like to know because we be take that money and reinveste every penny of it across the north in form of transportation that people use every day deliver benefit to community more quickly not just in his constituency but across the entire north that have be warmly welcome everywhere that have be do my right hon friend agree that the performance of the labour party in vote down our rwanda bill in the house of lords be disgrace it be only the conservative government and the conservatives who have plan for deal with illegal immigration and the people smuggler action on illegal immigration be top priority in my constituency and labour have no policy or plan on this at all my right hon friend make an excellent point he know as know that if we want fully to stop the boat we need to have work deterrent so if someone come here illegally we must be able to remove they to safe third country alternative that be why the rwanda scheme be so important and why we be determined to see it through just in the past week an independent report be publish that talk about the labour party policy in this area it make it crystal clear that labour do not have plan to stop the boat in fact its idea would see the uk accept hundred of thousand more migrant which part of his economic legacy be the prime minister most proud of be it preside over the high tax burden since the second world war or be it deliver the slow real wage growth since the napoleonic war save million job in the pandemic with

memorial to honour they so follow representation from my right hon friend the member for bromsgrove sir sajid javid and other have decide to allocate million towards the cost of build one whatever your faith colour or class this country will never forget the sacrifice make for our future in recent time the uk and the uk economy have deal with financial crisis pandemic and an energy shock cause by war in europe yet despite the most challenging economic headwind in modern history under conservative government since growth have be high than in every large european economy unemployment have halve absolute poverty have go down and there be more people in job for every single day that we have be in office interruption of course interest rate remain high as we bring down inflation but because of the progress we have make because we be deliver the prime minister economic priority we can now help family not just with temporary cost of live support but with permanent cut in taxation we do that to give much need help in challenging time and because conservative know that low tax mean high growth and high growth mean more opportunity more prosperity and more funding for our precious public service interruption order the chancellor have hardly say order you can not get excited yet other people want to hear what the chancellor have to say it matter so we will have bit of good behaviour please thank you madam deputy speaker if we want that growth to lead to high wage and high living standard for every family in every corner of the country it can not come from unlimited migration it can only come by build high wage high skill economy not just high gdp but high gdp per head that be the difference the labour party plan would destroy job reduce opportunity and risk family finance with spending that push up taxis instead of go back to square one the policy announce today mean more investment more job well public service and low taxis in budget for long term growth start with the update forecast from the office for budget responsibility for which thank richard hughes and his team first inflation when the prime minister and come into office it be the late figure order this be not amuse any more we need to hear what the chancellor have to say can tell who be make the noise and you simply will not get chance to speak later that be the end of it when the prime minister and come into office inflation be but the late figure show it be now than meet our pledge last year to halve it today forecast from the obr show it fall below the target in just few month time nearly whole year early than forecast in the autumn statement that do not happen by accident whatever the pressure and whatever the politic conservative government work with the bank of england will always put sound money first we also understand that tackle inflation while necessary be painful it mean high interest rate and period of low growth so we have give the average household in cost of live support over the past two year do so make economic as well as moral sense the obr predict real household disposable income per person would fall by in the past year instead after that support it be on track to rise by today take further step to help family with cost of living pressure start with measure to help the poor family we have already abolish high charge for electricity pay by those on prepayment meter increase the local housing allowance and raise benefit by double the expected inflation today focus on those fall into debt nearly million household on universal credit take out budgeting advance loan to pay for more expensive emergency such as boiler repair or help get job to help make such loan more affordable have decide to increase the repayment period for new loan from month to month for some think labour members care about people on the low income but trust they not to want to hear about debt for some people the good way to resolve debt be through debt relief order but get one cost which can deter the very people who need they most so have listen carefully to representation from citizens advice today relieve pressure on around family every year by abolish that charge completely next the household support fund it be set up on temporary basis and due to conclude at the end of this month have listen carefully to representation from the joseph rowntree foundation the trussell trust the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey and my hon friend the members for colchester will quince and for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds among other have decide that with the battle against inflation still not over now be not the time to stop the target help that it offer we will therefore continue it at current level for another six month next turn to measure that will help business and household more broadly in the autumn statement freeze alcohol duty until august of this year without any action today it would have be due to rise by however have listen carefully to my right hon friend for altrincham and sale west sir graham brady and for vale of glamorgan alun cairns and to my hon friend the member for moray douglas ross who be formidable champion of the scottish whisky industry also listen to councillor john tonks from ash strong supporter of the wonderful admiral pub who point out the pressure face the industry today have decide to extend the alcohol duty freeze until february that will benefit pub across the uk on top of the saving that typical pub will get from the business rate discount that announce in the autumn we value our hospitality industry we be back the great british pub another cost that family and business worry about be fuel the shadow chancellor complain about the freeze on fuel duty labour have oppose it at every opportunity the labour mayor of london want to punish motorist even more with his ultra low emission zone plan however lot of family and sole trader depend on their car if do nothing fuel duty would increase by this month so instead have listen to my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel my hon friend the members for stoke on trent north jonathan gullis and for dudley north marco longhi and other as well as to the sun newspaper keep it down campaign have as result decide to maintain the cut and freeze fuel duty for another month that will save the average car driver next year and bring total saving since the cut be introduce to around take together with the alcohol duty freeze that decision also reduce headline inflation by percentage point in allow we to make fast progress towards the bank of england target there can be no solid growth without solid finance an economy base on sound money do not pass its bill to the next generation when it come to borrowing some believe that there be trade off between compassion and fiscal responsibility they be wrong it be only because we responsibly reduce the deficit by between and that we could provide billion to help business and family in the pandemic labour oppose our plan to reduce the deficit every single step of the way but to be fair they be consistent in coalition the lib dems support control spending but now they say that they would prop up party that will turn on the spending tap it be the difference between no plan and no principle and be delighted that for once the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey be here to hear that today we say something different there be nothing compassionate about run out of money with the pandemic behind we we must once again be responsible and build up our resilience to future shock that mean bring down borrowing so we can start to reduce our debt and today figure confirm that be happen ahead of my first autumn statement in the obr forecast that headline debt would rise to above of gdp today it say that it will fall in every year to just by accord to the obr underlie debt which exclude bank of england debt will be in then and before fall to in with final year headroom against debt fall of billion our underlie debt be therefore on track to fall as share of gdp meet our fiscal rule and we continue to have the second low level of government debt in the low than that of japan france or the united states we also meet our second fiscal rule for public sector borrowing to be below of gdp three year early borrowing fall from of gdp in to then and in by the end of the forecast borrowing be at its low level of gdp since none of that of course would be possible if labour implement its pledge to decarbonise the grid five year early by by its own calculation that cost billion year to do last month after flip flopping for month labour say that it be not go to spend the billion after all but will somehow meet its pledge somehow can only mean one thing tax rise on work family same old labour today in contrast conservative government bring down taxis with borrow broadly unchanged in fact borrowing be slightly low than in the autumn statement the fact that we be bring borrow down be of particular importance to one very special person sir robert stheeman be the outgoing chief executive of the government debt management office and after year of exceptional public service he be in the gallery thank you sir robert now turn to growth just after become chancellor the obr expect gdp to fall by in the follow year in fact it grow albeit slowly now the obr expect the economy to grow by this year and next year which be high than its autumn forecast after that growth rise to and in interruption opposition member do not want to hear this but these be the fact since we have grow fast than germany france or italy the three large european economy and accord to the international monetary fund we will continue to grow fast than all three of they in the five year ahead survey by lloyds and deloitte show that business confidence be return in other word because we have turn the corner on inflation we will soon turn the corner on growth today obr forecast also show that we have make good progress on the prime minister three economic priority compare to when the three pledge be make inflation have halve debt be fall in line with our fiscal rule and growth be fully percentage point high than predict interruption labour member do not have growth plan so they might as well listen to our as growth return our plan be for economic growth not growth sustain through migration but growth that raise wage and living standard for family not just high gdp but high gdp per head that mean stick to our plan with budget for long term growth more investment more job well public service and low taxis start with investment economist say that stimulate investment be the most effective way to raise productivity and therefore wage and living standard since we have be do just that labour member might want to listen to what be about to say because business investment have rise from an average of of gdp under labour to under the conservatives this year it will be of gdp that be billion more business investment than if it have continue at

morally wrong those who can work should work and have tackle that issue in every budget and autumn statement have deliver year ago abolish the pension lifetime allowance which have push doctor and

to public service interruption think they be suppose to be interested in public can wait order little bit of murmur be normal but should not be able to hear what member be say over there that be clearly out of order let we have some courtesy thank you madam deputy speaker good public service need strong economy to pay for they but strong economy also need good public service in school in the uk be behind germany france and sweden in the oecd pisa programme for international student assessment education ranking for reading and math now after conservative reform we be ahead of they burglary and violent crime have halve in the last year after we invest in more police officer our armed force remain the most professional and well fund in europe with defence spending already more than of gdp we be provide more military support to ukraine than nearly any other country and our spending will rise to as soon as economic condition allow the nhs be still recover from the pandemic but have more doctor and more nurse than it do under labour that be more doctor and more nurse for every single month that we have be in office resource matter of course which be why despite all the economic shock we have face overall spending on public service have go up since in the case of the nhs by more than third in real term although spending have continue to rise every year public sector productivity still remain below pre pandemic level by nearly this demonstrate that the way to improve public service be not always more money or more people we also need to run they more efficiently we need more productive state not big state in autumn set day to day spending to increase by year in real term over the next parliament some say that be not enough and we should raise spending by more and other say it be too much and we should cut it to improve efficiency neither be right it be not fair to ask taxpayer to pay for more when public service productivity have fall nor would it be wise to reduce that funding give the pressure that public service face so be keep the plan growth in day to day spending at in real term but we be go to spend it well interruption the opposition do not have plan for public service as with everything else so why not listen to our today be announce landmark public sector productivity plan that restart public service reform and change the treasury traditional approach to public spending start with our big and most important public service the nhs one of my great privilege be to be health secretary thank to the nhs have three gorgeous child the old of whom have be patiently listen in the gallery the nhs be rightly the big reason most of we be proud to be british but the system that support its staff be often antiquated doctor nurse and ward staff spend hour every day fill out form when they could be look after patient interruption order do not like to interrupt the chancellor but mr streeting you be too close to to be shout that loudly if you want to shout that loudly you should go away and sit up there apologise for interrupt the chancellor when patient do not show up or one member of team be ill operate theatre be leave empty despite long waiting list when we publish the nhs long term workforce plan ask the nhs to put together plan to transform its efficiency and productivity want well care for patient more job satisfaction for staff and well value for taxpayer make change on the scale we need be not cheap the investment need to modernise nhs it system so they be as good as the good in the world cost billion but it help unlock billion of saving ten time that amount so in today budget for long term growth have decide to fund the nhs productivity plan in full with that new investment we will slash the million hour lose by doctor and nurse every year to outdated it system we will cut down and potentially halve form fill by doctor by use artificial intelligence we will digitise operate theatre process allow the same number of consultant to do an extra operation year we will fund improvement to help doctor read mri and ct scan more accurately and quickly speed up result for patient every year and save thousand of life something that know would have delight my brother charlie who recently lose to cancer we will improve the nhs app so that it can be use to confirm and modify all appointment reduce up to half million miss appointment annually and improve patient choice we will set up new nhs staff app to make it easy to roster electronically and end the use of expensive off framework agency as result of this funding all hospital will use electronic patient record make the nhs the large digitally integrate healthcare system in the world today announcement double the amount the nhs be invest on digital transformation over three year on top of this long term transformation we will also help the nhs meet pressure in the come year with an additional billion that will allow the nhs to continue its focus on reduce waiting time and bring the total increase in nhs funding since the start of the parliament to in real term the nhs be there for we in the pandemic and today with nearly billion of additional funding conservative government be there for the nhs the head of the nhs amanda pritchard today say that this investment show that the government continue to back the nhs she say that as result of the investment the nhs can commit to deliver annual productivity growth over the next parliament more than double the average productivity growth in public service between and but today be not just about the nhs want this groundbreaking agreement with the nhs to be model for all our public service across education the police the court and local government want to see more efficient well value and high quality public service so today can announce that in the next spending review the treasury will do thing differently we will prioritise proposal that deliver annual saving within five year equivalent to the total cost of the investment require and today we make start with some excellent proposal violence reduction unit and hotspot policing have prevent an estimate knife crime and other violent offence as well as over hospital admission every crime cost money so we will provide million to roll that model out in england and wales police officer waste around eight hour week on unnecessary admin with high productivity we could free the equivalent of police officer over year we will spend million roll out time save and money save technology that speed up police response time by allow people to report crime by video call and where appropriate use drone as first responder too many legal case particularly in family law should never go to court and it would cost we less if they do not so we will spend million to fund non court resolution reduce reoffende and digitise the court process too many child in care end up be look after by unregistered provider that be much more expensive so we will invest million over the next four year to reduce that cost by increase the capacity of the child home estate special educational need provision can be excellent when outsource to independent sector school but also expensive so we will invest million over the next four year to build new special free school to create additional high quality place and increase choice for parent we will also put in place plan to realise the ten of billion of saving recommend in an excellent speech by the head of the national audit office the obr say that increase in public sector productivity would be the equivalent of about billion in extra funding with these plan we can deliver that and more if we ensure that they be cash release saving as we be committed to do it will be possible to live with more constrain spending growth without cut service value by the public so with the energy and drive of my talented chief secretary to the treasury we launch our public sector productivity plan in today budget for long term growth more investment more job well public service and one more thing low taxis keep taxis down matter to conservative in way that it never can for labour we believe that in free society the money people earn do not belong to the government it belong to they and if we want to encourage hard work we should let people keep as much of their own money as possible conservative look around the world at economy in north america and asia and notice that country with low taxis generally have high growth economist argue about cause and correlation but we know that lower tax economy have more energy more dynamism and more innovation we know that be britain future too before explain how we will bring down taxis will start with some measure to make our system simple and fairer to discourage non smoker from take up vaping we be today confirm the introduction of an excise duty on vape product from october and publish consultation on its design because vape can also play positive role in help people quit smoking we will introduce one off increase in tobacco duty at the same time to maintain the financial incentive to choose vape over smoking will make one off adjustment to rate of air passenger duty on non economy flight only to account for high inflation in recent year and will provide hmrc with the resource it need to ensure that everyone pay the tax they owe lead to an increase in revenue collect of over billion across the forecast period next turn to property taxation in recent month follow tenacious representation from my hon friend the members for st austell and newquay steve double for north devon selaine saxby for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken for torbay kevin foster and for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory have be look closely at our furnished holiday letting tax regime be concerned that that regime be create distortion meaning that not enough property be available for long term rental by local people so to make the tax system work well for local community be go to abolish the furnished holiday letting regime have also be look at the stamp duty relief for people who purchase more than one dwelling in single transaction know as multiple dwelling relief see the deputy leader of the labour party the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner pay close attention give she multiple order too much excitement we have not actually hear because we can not hear what the chancellor be try to say interruption okay can hear who be shout and they will not get to speak later be sorry to disappoint the right hon member but multiple dwelling relief be not actually design for she it be it be intend to support investment in the private rented sector but an external evaluation find no strong evidence that it have do so and that it be be regularly abuse so be go to abolish it finally as part of our look at property taxation in this budget both the treasury and the obr have look at the cost associate with our current level of capital gain tax on property and conclude that if we reduce the high rate that exist for residential property we would in fact increase revenue because there would be more transaction for the first time in history both the treasury and the obr have discover their inner laffer curve so today will reduce the high rate of property capital gain tax from to really be for you angela laughter order have have enough from opposition members and be definitely not have it from government members now turn to oil and gas unlike the labour party we want to encourage investment in the north sea so we will retain generous investment allowance for the sector follow representation from my hon friend the member for banff and buchan david duguid we will also legislate in the finance bill to abolish the energy profit levy should market price fall to their historical norm for sustained period of time but because the increase in energy price cause by the ukraine war be expect to last long so too will the sector windfall profit so will extend the sunset on the energy profit levy for an additional year to raise billion next turn to the taxis pay by those who be resident in the uk but not domicile here for tax purpose hon member ah this be category of people know as non dom nigel lawson want to end the non dom regime in his great tax reform budget of which be where suspect the labour party get the idea from too have always believe that provide we protect the uk attractiveness to international investor those with the broad shoulder should pay their fair share after look at the issue over many month have conclude that we can indeed introduce system that both be fair and remain competitive with other country so the government will abolish the current tax system for non dom get rid of the outdated concept of aim to please all part of the house in all my budgets we will order this be impossible interruption order could you please shout more quietly laughter we will replace the non dom regime with modern simple and fair residency base system from april new arrival to the uk will not be require to pay any tax on foreign income and gain for their first four year of uk residency more generous regime than at present and one of the most attractive offer in europe but after four year those who continue to live in the uk will pay the same tax as other uk resident recognise the contribution of many of these individual to our economy we will put in place transitional arrangement for those benefit from the current regime that will include two year period in which individual will be encourage to bring wealth earn overseas to the uk so it can be spend and invest here measure that will attract onshore an additional billion of foreign income and generate more than billion of extra tax overall abolish non dom status will raise billion year by the end of the forecast period the opposition plan to use that money for spending increase but today conservative government make different choice we use that revenue to help cut taxis on work family many of those family depend on child benefit but the way that we treat child benefit in the tax system be confusing and unfair it be lifeline for many parent because it help with the additional cost associate with have child when it work it be good for child good for parent and good for the economy because it help people into work we currently withdraw child benefit when one parent earn over year that mean that two parent earn year receive the benefit in full but household earn lot less than that do not if just one parent earn over today set out plan to end that unfairness do so require significant reform to the tax system include allow hmrc to collect household level information we will therefore consult on move the high income child benefit charge to household base system to be introduce by april but because that be not quick fix make two change today to make the current system fairer follow representation from my hon friend the members for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates for carshalton and wallington elliot colburn for bassetlaw brendan clarke smith and for west worcestershire harriett baldwin along with many other confirm that from this april the high income child benefit charge threshold will be raise from to we will raise the top of the taper at which it be withdraw to that mean that no one earn under will pay the charge take family out of pay it altogether because of the high taper and threshold nearly half million family with child will save an average of next year accord to the obr this change will see an increase in hour among those already work to the equivalent of more people enter the workforce more investment more job well public service and low tax there be one further set of change that want to make today the way we tax people income be particularly unfair those who get their income from have job pay two type of tax national insurance contribution and income tax those who get it from other source pay only one this double taxation of work be unfair the result be complicated system that penalise work instead of encourage it if we be to build high wage high skill economy not dependent on migration and to encourage people not in work to come back to work we need simple fair tax system that make work pay that be why cut national insurance contribution in the autumn by reduce the penalty on work the obr say that that tax cut would lead to the equivalent of more people in work in other word it would fill more than one in vacancy throughout the economy low taxis more job and high growth today because of the progress that we have make in bring down inflation because of the additional investment flow into the economy because we have plan for well and more efficient public service and because we have ask those with the broad shoulder to pay bit order mr can manage thank you very much have hear you five time have let you get away with it but that be enough one more strike and you out know how hard it be for the opposition to listen to argument for low taxis that be the difference because we have ask those with the broad shoulder to pay bit more today go far from april employee national insurance will be cut by another from to and self employ national insurance will be cut from to that mean an additional year for the average employee or for someone who be self employ when combine with the autumn reduction it mean million employee will get an average tax cut of year and million of the self employ will get tax cut average those change will make our system simple and fairer and will grow our economy by reward work the obr say that when combine with the autumn reduction our national insurance cut will mean the equivalent of more people in work fill one in five vacancy and add to gdp and to gdp per head this be the second fiscal event in which we have reduce employee and self employ national insurance we have cut it by one third in six month without increase borrowing and without cut spending on public service that mean that the average earner in the uk now have the low effective personal tax rate since their effective taxis be now low than in america france germany or any country because conservative believe that make work pay be of the most fundamental importance and because we believe that the double taxation of work be unfair our long term ambition be to end this unfairness when it be responsible when it can be achieve without increase borrowing and when it can be deliver without compromise high quality public service we will continue to cut national insurance as we have do today so that we truly make work pay we stick to our plan with budget for long term growth it deliver more investment more job well public service and low taxis however dynamism in an economy do not come from ministers in whitehall but from the grit and determination of people who take risk work hard and innovate not government policy but people power it be to unleash people power that today we put this country back on path to lower taxis plan to grow the economy versus no plan plan for well public service versus no plan plan to make work pay versus no plan growth up job up and tax down commend this statement to the house provisional

it be declare that it be expedient in the public interest that this resolution should have statutory effect under the provision of the provisional collection of taxes act hunt call the leader of the opposition there we have it the last desperate act of party that have fail britain in recession the national credit card maxe out and despite the measure today the high tax burden for year this be the first parliament since record begin to see living standard fall as confirm by the budget today that be the conservatives record and it be still their record give with one hand and take even more with the other nothing they do between now and the election will change that over year we have see our fair share of delusion from the conservative party prime minister who think the cost of living crisis be start to ease an education secretary who think concrete crumble on our child deserve our gratitude and former prime minister who still believe that crash the pound be the right path for britian today we have new entry into this hall of infamy the chancellor who breeze into this chamber in recession and tell the work people of this country that everything be on track crisis what crisis or as the captain of the titanic and the former prime minister herself might have say iceberg what iceberg smile as the ship go down the chuckle brothers of decline dream of santa monica or maybe just quiet life in surrey with the chancellor not have to self fund his election while the crew behind they scramble around for gb news lifeboat if only it be not so serious the story of this parliament be devastatingly simple conservative party stubbornly cling to the fail idea of the past completely unable to generate the growth that work people need and force by that failure to ask they to pay more and more for less and less as the desperation grow the conservatives torch not only their reputation for fiscal responsibility but any notion that they can serve the country not themselves party first country second while work people pay the price food price be still high than they be two year ago rent be up by it will cost an extra month for typical family remortgage this year because the conservatives lose control of the economy they send interest rate through the roof and they make work people pay they should be under no illusion that record be how the british people will judge today cut because the whole country can see exactly what be happen here they recognise tory con when they see it just as they do in november give with one hand and take even more with the other people have be live through this nonsense for year they know that the threshold be still frozen drag more and more people into high taxis they know that tory stealth tax be come their way in the shape of their next council tax bill the levelling up secretary have tell not just this house but every house in the country that he be come for their council tax give with one hand gove with the other most insultingly of all the british people know the only cause that get this lot out of bed be try to save their own skin take the desperate move after year of resistance to finally accept labour argument on the non dom tax regime have there ever be more obvious example of government who be totally bereft of idea if they be sincerely in support of that policy the question they must answer be why do they not do it early why do they not stand up to their friend their funder and their family if they have follow labour example million extra operation and million dental emergency appointment would have take place by now and there would have be free breakfast club for nearly million child if instead this be just another short term cynical political gimmick honestly what be the point what be the point of party that be out of touch out of idea and nearly out of road we see this last year as well when only labour policy on the cost of living make the difference say to those on the conservative benches who be now little downbeat about another intellectual triumph for social democracy say get used to it with this pair in charge it will not be long before you be ask to defend the removal of private school tax relief as well the hard they try with cynical game like that the bad it will get for they because the whole country can see exactly who they be fight for themselves politic not govern party first country second because we have campaign to lower the tax burden on work people for the whole parliament and we will not stop now we will support the cut to national insurance but notice that in when the prime minister be chancellor he make this promise can confirm that in for the first time the basic rate of income tax will be cut from to report march vol have brief all week that an income tax cut be come that promise be in tatter of course we support the fresh investment in our nhs although have to note that the chancellor when he be health secretary year ago promise to make the nhs paperless by know the prime minister fondness for elon musk extend to an enthusiastic embrace of his community notes on fact check so will say this bit slowly labour support the fuel duty freeze that be our policy look forward to the prime minister acknowledgement of that in the come day we ask the chancellor to set out how he will ensure that the policy get pass on to hard press family at the pump for all the fanfare around the tax measure today this straightforward story remain true taxis at year high the british people pay more for less and an unprecedented hit to the living standard of work people this be the first time the government have go backwards over parliament and they be cheer that the reason be equally simple there be no plan for growth how can there be the chancellor can say long term plan all he like last year he announce growth measure he say that we have turn corner but where be we now britain be in recession with an economy small than when the prime minister enter downing street the textbook definition of decline that be their record after year who do they think feel well off productivity be flat mortgage be through the roof house building be off cliff worklessness be rise and rise homelessness have never be high crime go virtually unpunished child can not see dentist and there be sewage in our river billion and billion of taxpayer money have be waste include billion by the prime minister on covid fraud alone and million on the rwanda scheme that have achieve precisely nothing can keep go we have railway line that will never reach our great northern city in fact it might not even reach central london billion upon billion for white elephant without trunk while today we learn that taxpayer be pick up the bill for the science minister libel and all the time one thing be grow the waiting list in our nhs now stand at nearly million the government have have year they be run out of road this be what decline look like and the complacency they have show today take your breath away britain deserve well than this britain deserve real plan for growth an end to year of stagnation wealth creation across the whole of the country and high living standard for work people this be the mission we need but yet again what we get be the same tired old formula the stick plaster the chopping and change and the party first country second politic with no repudiation of the utterly discredit idea that economic growth be something that the few gift to the many even then the chancellor back benchers be owe an explanation he say that britain have grow more quickly than country such as germany over the last year but be sure they will be shock to learn that this be statistical sleight of hand when it come to gdp per capita the growth that make the difference to the pocket of work people the government record be much bad indeed in per capita term our economy have not grow since the first quarter of the long period of stagnation britain have see since in fact the chancellor invite we to look at those figure the office for budget responsibility have say that gdp per capita will be low in than be forecast in november last year that be the number he say we should watch low in the government can call this technical recession but there be nothing technical about work people live in recession for every second the prime minister have be in power this be rishi recession if conservative members really want to know what hide in the chancellor spreadsheet they will see that it be only the record level of migration they have deliver that have prevent an even deep decline that be the record they must stand on at the election while we on these benches do not demean for second the contribution that migrant make to thriving economy it be high time that the government be honest with the british public about the role migration play in their economic policy because right now in term of growth that be all they have there be nothing else no plan to get britain build again with reform planning system no ambition to invest in clean british power for cheap bill and energy security no inclination to move away from insecure low pay job and strengthen employment right so that we can finally make work pay where be the urgency on affordable housing how can the government look at britain now and not see that as massive priority never again will they be allow to pose as the party of home ownership and aspiration although have to say give the disaster that have befall their childcare plan perhaps that be for the good the cost of childcare be huge challenge for million parent need the chancellor to deliver on his promise it seem that he have be take lesson on marketing from the willy wonka experience in glasgow all be not as it seem with just over three week to go he have to come clean because up and down the country parent need to know will they get their entitlement in april or be this just another of the government reckless promise on govern headline over delivery promise without plan policy that unravel at the first contact with reality the lesson be crystal clear that those who break our economy can not be trust to repair it the tory credit rating be zero it be time for change with labour that be what today budget should have be about last chance for the government to show that they understand the economic reality of our volatile world that global supply chain can be weaponise by tyrant like putin that stick plaster approach to public investment will cost britain more in the long run and that trickle down nonsense mean that work people pay the price it could even have be moment of contrition reflection on their fiscal recklessness or perhaps an apology for the ridiculous chaos that they have inflict on business community and investor in this country and yet there be still no stable industrial strategy still no national wealth fund to crowd in private investment still no urgency on speed up critical infrastructure project and no recognition that they have leave in tatter our standing as country that always keep its promise and if they do not like that accusation they should look no far than the grotesque spectacle of the government duck their responsibility to the victim of the infected blood and horizon scandal this be one of the great miscarriage of justice in our nation history official report january vol those be the prime minister word just two month ago today justice have be kick beyond the general election britain can see exactly who they be and the reality be that there be no path to economic stability and no way to calm less chaotic politic with the conservative party in power because chaos be now their worldview it be mindset that see britain problem as opportunity that the conservative party can exploit whether like the chancellor it be out of desperation because they can not solve they or whether like the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman and the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss it be because they have no intention of solve they for party this weak and divided the end result be always the same vicious downward spiral with chaos feed off decline and decline feed off chaos while work people pay the price the british people know that this will not stop five more year and it will only get bad there will be no change of direction without change of government and that leave britain as nation in limbo unable to shake off the tory chaos that drag we into recession load the tax burden on to the back of work people and maxe out the nation credit card britain deserve government who be ready to take tough decision to give our public service an immediate cash injection to stick to fiscal rule without complaint to fight for the living standard of work people and to deliver sustainable plan for growth we say to the chancellor and the prime minister that it be time to break the habit of year to stop the dithering the delay and the uncertainty and to confirm may as the date of the next general election because britain deserve well and labour be ready interruption will not demand silence now as this be the moment for cheer call the chair of the treasury committee know it have not be long since the autumn statement but we have hear today that the leader of the opposition have no plan it have not be very long since the last forecast from the office for budget responsibility so it be interesting to read today that in the just over day since its last forecast there have be lot of change for the well in the uk economy in particular the obr be expect well inflation outturn than it have expect just over three month ago it be expect and have note the sharp fall in the interest rate that we all pay on the national mortgage and it have say that it expect the british people living standard to recover more quickly than it previously forecast that be information that we can all welcome there will be range of view across the chamber on the role of the office for budget responsibility we all know of course that all forecast be likely to be wrong the treasury committee will scrutinise the office for budget responsibility next tuesday morning and we look forward to ask question about its assumption my view be that it be bit like that quote of sir winston churchill about democracy be the bad form of government except for all the other that have be try although all economic forecast be likely to be wrong in some way and the office for budget responsibility forecast be often not the most accurate they be lot well than the alternative of either the treasury mark its own homework or have budget with no forecast from the office for budget responsibility think the obr forecast reassure the market on which we be so dependent for our borrowing there have obviously be good progress on inflation since the peak of over after putin evil invasion of ukraine and it be vital that all of today budget measure be see through the lens of inflation because we do not want anything that could prevent that progress towards the that the bank of england expect by the middle of this year the chancellor tell we that he be look through that lens in announce today measure which contain range of thing that will really help include continue the off fuel duty at the pump for another year which will be very helpful to driver in west worcestershire and elsewhere in the country the freeze on alcohol duty will be welcome in pub in west worcestershire and across the country the public sector productivity plan be crucial to ensure that we get value for money from our public service on the second economic objective of growth we can all welcome the fact that employment growth have be so strong the economy have create more than job day over the past year we have see step take in previous fiscal event to grow the size of the uk productive economy now that we be at full employment productivity become incredibly important because it help to sustain non inflationary growth to stimulate all important investment in the economy last year big announcement of full expensing be make permanent in the autumn statement today we have hear that full expensing will be extend to lease asset the bbc fact check note that when the measure be first announce it be expect that the economy would benefit greatly the chancellor say that its impact on the economy would be huge and the office for budget responsibility say that it would increase business investment by year the policy come into force on april and in fact business investment for the whole of last year be high than in today we hear about far welcome step to increase business investment and other investment in the uk economy tax relief for some creative industry british individual saving account to encourage more long term investment in our economy the back to work plan the childcare plan and many other measure that will unlock growth be the chancellor and indeed the hon lady be little complacent about investment although it be true that business investment be high than it be in our business investment be still the low in the and among the low in the oecd why do we not see more public investment from the chancellor today we know that public investment will crowd in private investment so why have we not see much bold and more ambitious work on investment that be what the economy be cry out for we hear the chancellor talk about how strong the growth in uk investment have be we hear about additional investment in the productivity of our national health service and crucially about measure that will increase the attractiveness of invest in some of the fast grow sector of the economy do my hon friend agree that it be extraordinary that the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas represent the green party do not welcome the million for advanced manufacturing in clean aviation and clean vehicle and the million for clean tech manufacturing that be the uk invest in the technology of clean growth be it not it be indeed and be glad that my hon friend welcome that even if it be not welcome by the representative of the green party want to take my hon friend back to what she say about investment in childcare remind she that this week bring international women day and the cost of childcare be such an important issue for so many mum in this country of course it be the conservatives who roll out hour of free childcare and who be roll out free childcare for two year old and nine month old we absolutely must welcome that additional investment in childcare and indeed the investment in family through support for child benefit which will help mum get into well pay job wholeheartedly endorse what my right hon friend say she be right to highlight the importance of investment in childcare in help female employment growth which have be remarkably strong in the past year be confident that the measure announce will allow we to make further progress with the increasingly non inflationary growth capacity of the uk economy other measure announce today will help on the growth front cut national insurance be also smart way to help growth it not only put more money in work people million people across this country will see an extra year in their bank account but will make work more attractive we have hear from the office for budget responsibility that cut national insurance have the big marginal impact on bring people back into work the figure from the last cut be it will be interesting to see whether the obr continue to expect this to have significant impact it be really smart way to cut taxis for work people and the measure be uk wide so the effect will be feel in scotland as well turn to the issue of debt fall we can see that the bond market have stabilise and obr number confirm progress on debt draw the house attention to report that our committee recently publish on the bank of england and its quantitative tightening it be sell billion of gilt into the market this year and it have acknowledge that that increase the cost to the exchequer of borrow by between tenth and quarter of percentage point our committee want to flag up the impact that that could have and to send message to the independent bank of england about some of the way in which quantitative tightening have an impact on the real economy as cross party committee we be obviously never go to agree on the level or scope of taxis but one thing we have unanimity rise do the right hon gentleman wish to intervene on the fact that the rate of tax be high in scotland wish to raise point about quantitative easing which the hon lady mention obviously there will be very significant supply of gilt in the come period which will have an impact on yield that will influence what the bank of england do on the interest rate cycle and crucially it will make it difficult to see any material growth in the money supply particularly in in the come period that will have an impact on growth give where we be be sorry that the right hon gentleman do not acknowledge that income tax be high in scotland but he make good point about quantitative tightening and its impact on the real economy it be potentially factor that can have real impact and our committee will watch it closely as be say as cross party committee we be never go to agree on the level and scope of taxis but we do agree that the tax system be too complicated we have very complicated tax system in this country and well over different tax relief despite the abolition of the office of tax simplification there have be some major tax simplification under this chancellor we have hear about the way in which he eliminate in the autumn statement the national insurance class about how he have simplify the lifetime allowance for pension and today about how he have start to tackle some of the perverse cliff edge high marginal tax rate and disincentive to work in the tax system by raise the vat threshold he have help small business which might otherwise have hold back because they do not want to go through that threshold on universal credit we have do so much over the year to reduce high marginal tax rate and disincentive it be great to hear the chancellor really focus today on address the high income child benefit charge when we introduce it vote for it at the year be high rate of income with the progress on high income the median income have increase from about in those day to about now these day be not more than about over the median income it be right for the chancellor to recognise that today in his budget statement he have make the taper that much less of disincentive to take on work above that income level of course would have love he to have do even more but be very grateful for all that he have do let come to rapid close by say that it be clear that the conservatives have plan it be clear that there be plan to get inflation down to increase the growth rate and the growth capacity of the uk economy without spark inflation again and to get debt fall think we can all see that the plan be work we should stick to that plan and not go back to square one rise order before call the spokesman for the scottish national party it might be helpful for hon member to know that hope to be able to manage the debate certainly at the beginning without formal time limit if everybody speak for about six to seven minute we will manage without formal time limit if they do not we will set one it will begin by be about seven minute but will reduce as the day go on call drew hendry traditionally at this point would thank the chancellor for advance sight of his redacted statement but have see the statement realise that be give an entirely different redacted document not to worry as we have see all the detail in the press over the past day or so see the unredacted word would be nice but it be not essential for this response thank the chancellor for his courtesy in stay in the chamber unlike some of his colleague to listen to the word of the third party that do not happen all the time but it be very good practice for those who might well be in the third party after the next election the chancellor say that his autumn statement be statement for growth but what have we see since then growth have go down it be have grow into recession today the obr say have steadily decline since early real gdp per person be forecast to trough at per cent below its pre pandemic peak in the first half of so that be not statement for growth and this be not budget for growth start by welcome some of the measure that the chancellor have announce today he at least address the non dom status which be positive move forward although he give they the soft possible landing he announce change to child benefit that be very good we must give credit to paul lewis for his campaigning on that issue he tweet today as other member of the press have do that he be tip off by the chancellor that the change be come the move on lifetime isa be welcome the support for the aerospace industry although it be the small possible step that could have be take be welcome as be any further investment in life science the chancellor set lot of store on productivity today he be go to solve everything with productivity yet if we look back over the past year and indeed before that we see that the uk have be exceptionally poor on productivity the figure on productivity have not budge at all interruption the chancellor be say what about scotland he should look at the figure for scotland over the past year and then we can have that debate the chancellor say that vacancy would be easy to fill through immigration but his party join by the labour party and now the lib dems impose brexit and stop free movement of course it would have be easy to fill vacancy with skilled people who want to do the job we have include vital job in tourism hospitality the national health service the care service and across many other sector if that possibility have not be take away by decision make in this place economist who be look at his national insurance cut have say that the gain will be cancel out as they be last time by the freeze on threshold there be very little for people on low income and zero for million people on less than year so there be not lot of sense in that measure he boast that he have take over as chancellor when inflation be at but we must remember that the tory government be in charge when inflation be at that level the problem with inflation be their child they also suggest that be somehow triumph but inflation mean price still go up let we face it this be last ditch tone deaf approach to desperately try to recover in the poll it be the embodiment of put the tory party before the people where be the real measure that would have real impact on the cost of living which be what people need the most direct help with for those live in fear of their energy bill who be be tell once again that their direct debit be increase slice more off their take home pay none of this be more than cold comfort for those star in disbelief as they realise that their shopping bill be more than high than they be couple of year ago this will stick in their throat for those truss to their new much high mortgage and rent directly because of reckless decision make in this place the wall be close in on public service the chancellor have fail people again paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies have note that the chancellor would have to explain how public service which be already on their knee could possibly take more cut let we not forget the billion he slash from public spending in the autumn statement the ifs continue the economic case for tax cut be weak the public finance remain in poor position the chancellor today promote furth billion cut accord to the ifs public service have be leave struggle after year of underfunding economic chaos and blunder from mini budgets to brexit colossal waste of hundred of billion of pound fraud and cronyism public finance be now so par to the bone that we can see the marrow be it any wonder that grow number of english council whether run by the tories labour or the lib dems be now effectively bankrupt people in scotland need budget that deliver funding that would allow investment for our public service include real investment in the nhs that support family with the cost of living and that properly invest in green energy not another austerity chancellor take an even big axe to investment than his predecessor when it come to the election in scotland those people will have their say and make their choice there be clear choice between that and the snp call to invest in public service the economy and our community in our town and city centre in our manufacturing future and our rural area in our tourism industry in our food and drink sector and in the priority and value they hold dear those will be the major dividing line at the general election the scottish government be commit to protect people from some of the bad westminster policy and be make real difference to the life of people in scotland despite their limited power the prime minister may be under the impression that the cost of living crisis be ease but that assessment will be slap in the face for household across scotland that be still face the consequence of over decade of tory cut and mismanagement of the economy people will see straight through attempt by the chancellor to make up for fall living standard underfunde public service and wage stagnation with these poorly time national insurance cut which will not improve overall standard of live for most household leave aside the chancellor failure to deal with fiscal drag which wipe out much of the benefit of the ni cut the vast inequality in benefit for the well off and the geographical impact that mean london benefit much more than anywhere else he can not escape the fact that the government have now impose the high tax burden since the end of the second world war want to tackle the issue of tax in scotland our progressive move in scotland mean that not only do the majority of people pay less tax but they also pay far low council tax than in england they be support with free prescription do not have to pay tuition fee and get the game change scottish child payment and more that be about do what be right invest in our people not leave they high and dry while the tories cut public funding in england the scottish government progressive approach to income tax have raise significant revenue to invest in public service in scotland the scottish government tax regime mean that on average household in the low half of the income distribution be year well off than they would be in the rest of the uk around of household be well off under the scottish tax and social security system than they would be in the rest of the uk take different progressive course on income tax in scotland mean that the scottish fiscal commission estimate that in the scottish government will have around billion of additional revenue compare to if they have follow uk government tax policy the scottish government continue to reaffirm their social contract with the scottish people with people across scotland reap the benefit through free prescription free university tuition free school meal free bus travel for and free dental care until as well as publicly own rail service free childcare for two three and four year old and seven additional welfare payment include the revolutionary scottish child payment before move on to other economic matter the chancellor mention freeze tax on scotch whisky as in the autumn statement we say that be not enough that industry be massive for scotland scotch whisky be massive export for both scotland and the uk yet it be still tax at around we need cut in that tax today so that the industry could deliver its potential the fact that that be not address in the budget be shame on the government austerity be an ever decrease circle it be fiscal madness to pursue the same policy that have be fail so obviously for many year yet none of the other party can bear to face the truth for an economy to grow it need proper investment for public service to deliver to free up the potential of our people they need to be support not asset strip and starve of resource the chancellor mention billion for digitisation of the nhs in order to get those so call productivity gain wonder how much of that will go to private company once the dust settle he should have boost nhs spending by billion to improve healthcare after the uk government impose real term cut this year he should have fund nhs pay properly so that it match that of scotland where there have be no nhs strike and catch up with previous cut where be the announcement on settle with the victim of the contaminated blood scandal miss move on to the economy the chancellor should have turbocharge investment in green energy by invest at least billion per year to compete in the global green energy goldrush and to secure sustain economic growth where else be the serious high return growth suppose to come from we have not hear it mention here today we do not know where it be that billion be need labour adviser have tell the labour party that that billion be need everybody know that that billion year be need yet no one in the labour party be willing to make the investment that be need to protect it this be the abandonment of the just transition interruption we be hear chuntere from the labour front benchers interruption oh dear imagine pick up on that one their big turn their big abandonment of the just well it be pretty big turn know that it be one of many but it be also pretty big the fact that labour members be rattle show how much they feel this this abandonment of the just transition and the fantastic opportunity that it promise by both the tories and those in the shadow of the labour party be reckless and stupid not only will it be feel economically but it ignore the desperate need to act on climate change the failure to invest in this will hold scotland back from reach our green energy ambition and will leave household vulnerable to future energy crisis the chancellor must finally match the level of ambition that we be see in other country the government have be show by the european union and by the united states with its inflation reduction act that this issue need to be take seriously yet they be sit on their hand scotland can be at the forefront of the green energy revolution thank to our incredible natural resource in onshore and offshore wind and in wave tidal and hydro power but with labour and the tories intent on pull the rug from under industry foot we risk see yet another generation of energy potential waste by westminster the chancellor must commit to invest properly in renewable and must decouple the price of gas from the price of electricity we can not ensure just transition from oil and gas for the people and community who rely on they if we squeeze the life out of the sector overnight we know that household across scotland have be badly hit by the energy crisis and that proper investment in renewable can reduce the bill for household citizens advice scotland have reveal that in the past four year it have see the number of people request advice and support with energy bill increase by time labour members be again chuntere from sedentary position say that be go on for too long take that as sign that they be not comfortable with what be say be just bored by it they be bore by the just transition they be bore by the cost of energy that people have to pay they be bore by all these thing bored bored order be about to ask for order so that the hon gentleman could be hear but think that the noise be come from immediately behind he interruption the hon member for coatbridge chryston and bellshill steven bonnar must not shout at he can shout at other people but not at thank you madam deputy speaker can make more progress if be not interrupted so do appreciate your advice on that talk about advice want to return to citizens advice scotland it reveal that in the past four year it have see the number of people request advice and support on energy bill increase by time that be shocking increase proper investment in green energy can make sure that people in scotland never have to face an energy crisis of this scale again as have say the chancellor could have help family with the cost of live by scrap grossly unfair and unequal energy bill stand charge and use billion wealth tax to fund annual energy discount for household reintroduce mortgage interest tax relief cap supermarket food price and match the scottish child payment uk wide he could have boost uk finance but he choose not to do so he could have introduce the long overdue essential guarantee while scrap callous policy such as the two child limit and the benefit cap one of the most game change thing he could have do be to finally give up on the fail experiment that have be brexit rejoin the eu single market and deliver economic growth the chancellor must help business and introduce measure to support the tourism and hospitality industry we know that business have face very challenging period with covid brexit and the increase cost from all side make life more difficult for people across scotland that be why the snp be call on the chancellor to reduce the rate of vat for the tourism and hospitality sector it be not too late for he to do that reinstate vat free shopping for international visitor and implement vat free street to support struggle town centre and high street if nothing be do to halt their decline and they continue to be ignore as they have be for too long community will suffer and far more tax will be lose in the long term than it would cost to provide they with some support the government could choose to construct mini enterprise zone work with devolved governments and local authority to agree on which sector and area be most in need of support these sector could benefit from reduction in vat or from no vat at all if the need be great enough that could be tie to business agree to pay the real living wage the chief executive of marks spencer yesterday describe operate under the current government as like run up downwards escalator with rucksack on your back if the government can roll out freeport then why not freeport for people they could reduce alcohol duty for whisky and other spirit to support scotland thrive whisky sector that add billion to the uk economy business in scotland can no long afford to be hold back by the uk low growth economy the chancellor should bring in measure to support business that have be leave pay the price for the uk government disastrous brexit it be clear that the snp be the only party commit to rejoin the eu and give scottish business the chance to access good and talent from our close neighbour the scottish government be commit to protect the people of scotland from some of the bad westminster policy and be make real difference to the life of people in scotland despite their limited power the cut to the scottish government capital budget and financial transaction have mean that they have have to take some difficult decision in this year budget but they be still commit to deliver for the people of scotland the snp fully support the billion package the uk government have deliver for northern ireland and urge the chancellor to make similar funding available in line with the barnett formula to help the scottish government deal with the budget pressure they face the scottish government be freeze council tax except in tory liberal democrat and some labour council where those council think that people should pay more the scottish government be also lift child out of poverty with measure such as the scottish child payment provide child winter heating payment to help mitigate additional heating cost for household with the most severely disabled child provide free school meal to all child in year to and to all eligible child throughout the school provide all baby in scotland with the essential need for the first six month of child life through the baby box introduce hour of fund early learning and childcare to all three and four year old and eligible two year old and make bus travel free for million people in scotland include all child and young people under the age of eligible disabled people and anyone age or over that be just snapshot of some of the landmark policy that the scottish government have bring in and all of they have be achieve against the backdrop of limited power and be tie to westminster system that as we have see from today budget continue to do nothing for the people of scotland just to emphasise what the chairman of ways and means say it would be helpful if colleague confine their remark to about six minute so that we can get everybody in with equal time call the father of the house it be interesting to follow the hon member for inverness nairn badenoch and strathspey drew hendry be wait to hear how the experiment with high taxation be go invite the snp to publish the figure show how many of the top philanthropist in scotland five year ago be still pay tax in scotland and how the top individual taxpayer in scotland five year ago be do now interruption it be an example snp members do not like have question put to they but there we be when the leader of the opposition start speak it sound to begin with as though it be his health spokesman who be speak also reflect on the journey of the leader of the opposition over the last few year in and within the memory of the house he want his right hon friend the member for islington north jeremy corbyn to be prime minister when there be vacancy to succeed the right hon member for islington north as the leader of the labour party the candidate who be close to he be the person who be now the leader of the opposition his journey over the last couple of year in change his view or his approach be quite significant think people can believe that the labour party want to change for example in the other worthe constituency represent two third of the town none of the local councillor be judge suitable to be put on the shortlist for selection as the parliamentary candidate that show central power in the hand of the leader of the opposition and his national executive think most people will have find that surprising have be one of the labour councillor tell could not apply would have be pretty upset the reaction have receive from my constituent to the financial statement and the budget have come down to one particular point someone say could there please be change on the level of pension pot that require financial advice when it be introduce in the level be my constituent who have pension pot of have be quote for advice on how to realise that relatively small pension pot ask treasury ministers to consider whether in the finance bill they could lift that figure to or so that people who want to gather up small part of their define benefit pension can use it the second reaction that have from constituent be that since labour take control of worthe borough council two third of the reserve have go within two year people be worry whether the council can remain solvent if that be test of what labour might do in government it be pretty good reason to follow the chancellor and the prime minister and to re elect we so that we can go on try to raise the level of productivity and growth reform and develop public service and get more people into work with high tax revenue and preferably low rate of tax the chancellor announce change to the penalty on child benefit go back far enough to remember when most of the value of child benefit come in the child tax allowance child can not work if have dependent pensioner in my household an income would come with they any family who have child under work age ought to be able to get that kind of support so that over family lifecycle they receive support when they need it and pay back in when they be more able to work hope that we can move to stage where the child benefit penalty go completely there be no philosophical or economic justification for it it be an error and hope that vote against it when it come in you do probably do you know be that sort of person there be many thing on the environmental side that will not go into due to the limitation on time hope that the propose district heating scheme which the government want to be one of their flagship project support by local authority can go ahead there be problem with the cost of lane rental to put hot pipe under our road but we need to give serious attention to how we get major investment so that nearly all our home come off burning hydrocarbon whether it be gas or the like and get on to solar heating or heat pump either air or ground source heating that will require major effort especially for residential leasehold property the chancellor announce more money for more free school hope that one of they will be the special educational need and disability school propose in worthing on the new durrington estate nearly one child in five in west sussex have some kind of statement or need they deserve specialist support it be good for they and good for the other child hope that we will get an announcement on that very soon have say that welcome the government plan those who say that labour would take we back to square one be exactly right this be budget entirely focus on the electoral prospect of the conservative party not the need of the country or our people the chancellor decide that his only chance to get his party through the election be to trumpet so call tax cut but the tax burden be actually go up he have make an incredible series of assumption about departmental spending up to five year in the future and then blow all the money that he save by make those assumption on pre election giveaway it be obvious from the moment he sit down last november that this early budget would contain more so call cut to personal taxis albeit against background of rise taxis as the obr confirm in paragraph on page of its report taxis will rise as percentage of gdp all the way up to the chancellor say that he be seek tax cut before the obr have even produce its current forecast he say it before the uk economic situation deteriorate leave our economy in technical recession and wipe out his expected fiscal headroom and he hint at tax cut before it emerge that our economy be now small than when the prime minister first walk into downing street in recent day we have observe the chancellor and prime minister engage in an unedifye increasingly frantic search for tax rise and future spending cut to top up the kitty for personal tax giveaway they have come up with vape tax and change to non dom status that be propose by labour and long ridicule by the chancellor himself perhaps minister will indicate whether those who no long have non dom status will pay inheritance tax we have also have change to the tax treatment of the holiday let regime while the conservative party cheer the tax cut sleight of hand let we bear in mind some fact despite all the chancellor smoke and mirror the tax burden at the end of this parliament will be high than it have be since the second world war yet our public service be crumble around we with one in local authority on the verge of bankruptcy and our infrastructure and public realm fall apart the cost of living crisis persist with the uk real wage growth the slow it have be since the napoleonic war no wonder we have flatline economy the freeze to income tax and national insurance threshold be due to raise billion in the next five year as million of people be drag into high rate tax the personal tax cut that the chancellor be brandish today be in other word completely drown out by the other huge increase in tax and the chancellor and his predecessor have announce even more the chancellor have claim that it be his moral duty to cut taxis but in reality he have put they up and just hop that nobody will notice the hon lady be make powerful case for the need for investment in public service but in that context wonder why the labour party appear to be support the freezing of fuel duty we know that the cost of freeze fuel duty since be staggering billion and that climate emission since be high than they would have be have that policy not be in effect precisely because she want more money to go into public service can she explain why labour be support this extraordinary policy think that the costing of the policy in the forecast ought to be more honest and it should be take out of the scorecard if it be not to be put into effect taxis be still high than they have be since the second world war and the government have continue to fritter billion on fraud and waste only today we learn that taxpayer have have to pick up the bill for the legal cost of the secretary of state for science innovation and technology and for the damage in libel case how much have that debacle cost we first the conservatives give we the catastrophic mini budget with its unfunded tax cut which spook the market and send mortgage cost and rent soar for million and now the current chancellor have decide to fund his election giveaway with the fiscal fiction of huge cut in plan departmental spending schedule to last the whole of the next parliament there be no detailed plan for how those cut in spending can be safely deliver because we be not to have spending review today the chancellor confirm that there will not be spending review until after the next general election he pencil in so call increase of nearly for departmental budget spending but have not compensate for high than expect inflation or population growth or any extra cost pressure departmental spending be not just flatline at if my hon friend look at capital on page of the red book she will see that most department be stay still or in some case such as the home office education and defence have their budget cut by my right hon friend must be able to read my mind because that be exactly the point be come on to make in real term there be cut of up to in unprotected departments go all the way through to the end of the next parliament that have be describe by david gauke the tory ex treasury minister as the height of fiscal irresponsibility the legacy of this government be burgeon government debt up from of gdp when labour leave office in to now the chancellor will barely meet his own self impose fiscal rule by the tiny of margin meanwhile his neglect mean that nhs waiting list have soar with million treatment outstanding and despite publish plan for growth since the trend growth rate be down from in the to this year there be no regional plan no work industrial strategy and no sign of level up regional disparity be widen not close and gdp be now billion less than expect from the obr growth rate forecast wage have stagnate and the government have deliver deepening level of poverty cause by low wage and real term benefit cut which have reduce the income of the poor and see the number of people rely on food bank go from to nearly million we have see the last desperate throw of the dice from failing discredit government who have long since run out of idea and be finally run out of road have declare my business interest in the register of members financial interests be pleased that the chancellor start by remind the nation that under conservative leadership government since have preside over the creation of new job every day every week every month and every year and have halve unemployment the scourge of worklessness which be inherit have be banish we now have the less worrying problem that we can not get enough people to fill all the job rather than the other way around of not have enough job for the people be pleased that the chancellor remind the house that in growth we have outperform all the major european nation although be sure he would agree with that that be feeble target to set ourselves we be now free to do so much well the question we need to ask be why have the united states of america outperform europe so comprehensively for so long and what can we learn the first thing we can learn from the united states be well system of economic policy guidance and control the requirement on the federal reserve board the us central bank be balanced mandate not just inflation which be necessary target that we share but the promotion of growth and of growth in employment so the board understand the trade off and can adjust policy accordingly as our way of steer the economy would love we to get rid of fanciful make up figure by the obr for five year time which be always wrong and to have two main aim that inflation target bind not merely on the bank but on the whole government because government have big impact on price and wage and growth rate target or considerably high growth rate than european country have be achieve in the past decade that be achievable if we take the right action to do that we need the bank of england to work in sympathy with the government policy remind the house that there be dual mandate on the bond portfolio the so call apf or asset purchase facility the bank of england have buy far too many bond at ridiculously high price on very low yield and run very loose policy that give we inflation have now lurch too far the other way and be run too tight policy sell far too many bond at much low price price it deliberately lower in the market and saddle we with loss the budget document confirm that the accumulate loss pay so far which taxpayer and the treasury have to pay amount to billion since the thing flip over in the last figure see be billion year to date unaffordable and unnecessary quite the wrong policy mean that we have less growth and far big bill be glad that the government have decide to major on productivity in general and in particular on public sector productivity some month ago stumble across well conceal office for national statistics figure say that in the three year since covid we have lose productivity in our public service do quick back of the envelope calculation and that be roughly billion which mean that it cost billion more today to produce the same level and range of public service as it do before covid as well as the many ten of billion more on top of that we have to pay because of all the inflation it be billion hit the government now more or less agree the chancellor have cost the loss in his figure at rather than but he have say that he want to eliminate productivity shortfall out of the and he cost that at billion which be exactly the same as my billion for that be felicitous indeed the issue be how will they go about do that hear that the scheme for the nhs be elaborate expenditure on wide range centralised computerisation good luck with that but would not rely on that alone for my productivity package for the public service we do not actually need new investment to get ourselves back to the productivity level we be at in we do not need to use all today wonderful artificial intelligence we just need to use what we already have which we have in it be about management personnel and give the personnel the right task we have see huge increase in managerial and administrative position but far from manage thing well they be be manage less well we have shocking case in the press recently where an awful lot of manager be preside over prison that have go wrong they be not able to do the more important day by day thing that be need in order to resolve the problem if we look at the huge expansion in the civil service and other public administration during the covid period we will see big increase not only in number but in those who have be promote up the grade for whatever reason we need enough people for someone to supervise however and we do not need all supervisor because they be often too posh to do the work we need to manage thing well and that be the productivity challenge before we also urge the government to abolish uk government investments it be very expensive body that have completely dreadful track record it preside over the post office and do nothing to deal with the sub postmaster it preside over billion worth of accumulate loss bankrupt the corporation and it preside over network rail and the whole rail industry network rail and high speed be absorb billion of public money this year do not think we be get value for money for that my time be up urge the government to redouble effort on productivity to understand that it be mainly about whom we hire and what we ask they to do and to get rid of ukgi and ask ministers to take responsibility for the dreadfully badly perform nationalise industry what we hear from the chancellor be budget that reek of desperation and deceit from government who know that they have lose the trust of the british people it be bottom of the barrel budget with nothing to make family truly well off after the catastrophic fall in living standard under the conservatives and no plan for long term economic growth no real extra support for the nhs and our public service and no end in sight for the year of unfair tax hike just last ditch attempt from the conservative party to cling on to power people have have enough of this government empty promise what they want be general election to get this out of touch government out of downing street they be sick and tired of government who promise in last year budget to grow the economy only to plunge it into recession who promise to bring down nhs waiting list only to let they continue to go up and up and who promise to cut tax but have instead hit family with year of unfair stealth tax rise never before have see government deliver weak public service high taxis and zero growth all at the same time and all in the middle of cost of living crisis fear that by design his economic policy to give short term sugar rush to conservative back benchers the chancellor be condemn million of family to high mortgage rate for much much long the house need not take my word for it just look at the obr which forecast mortgage rate stay at or more for the next five year at least that be disaster for homeowner across the united kingdom let we look at taxis the chancellor seem desperate to convince people that he be let they keep more of their own money but he be fool no one everyone can see his suppose tax cut for what it really be badly execute conjure trick give with one hand but take away twice as much with the other since last april typical household have already pay extra because of his stealth tax on income tax threshold that be money that they be simply not go to get back even after today announcement that same family will pay an additional in tax next year because the chancellor have freeze their tax free allowance on top of that they have soar mortgage payment food price and energy bill to worry about this tax cut have already be wipe out by the time the ink dry on the chancellor speech people be also look for investment in our public service especially our nhs across our country see more and more frustration that nothing seem to work anymore under this government people can not get hospital appointment in time they can not see their gp in time and they can not get an ambulance on time in hampshire the local nhs be so stretch that there be proposal to close the at the royal hampshire county hospital in manchester stepping hill hospital have have an entire out patient ward close for month because it be unsafe for patient and staff in south london st helier hospital have be leave to crumble with no sign of the investment promise by the government and and maternity service be at risk of closure when the chancellor make cruel cut to vital service it do not just affect number on spreadsheet it affect people life either he do not get that or he just do not care hear what the right hon gentleman say about investment but from to he be part of the coalition that savagely cut service in the north east include expenditure in local government and health the consequence be now have to be address because that austerity have continue do he take any responsibility for his role in our crumble infrastructure first say quite gently to the right hon gentleman that the spending plan propose by the labour party go into the election be bad than what actually happen moreover when in government we fight the conservatives on maintain education spending which we do maintain they then cut it after let we look now at the economy perhaps the most out of touch claim by the chancellor be that the economy be turn corner the only corner the economy be turn under this government be from stagnation to recession they have leave our economy small than it be in when the prime minister take office the good growth rate they have achieve in the past three quarter of be gdp per capita people share in our country wealth have be fall for nearly two year in row that be the long stretch on record and it have leave the average household poor there be bad to come nearly million mortgage holder will soon see their repayment skyrocket by an average of month because of the high interest rate that be the government real track record recession make in downing street with no hint of chance to turn thing around the chancellor could have stand up today and give people fair deal he could have cancel the unfair tax hike that he have plan for april and raise the tax free personal allowance he could have properly fund the nhs to bring down waiting list and let more people return to work help to grow our economy he could have champion unpaid carer and raise the carer allowance he could have support people with the cost of living and those struggle with their mortgage payment by reverse his tax cut for the big bank he could have present serious plan for economic growth by launch an industrial strategy reform business rate and stand up for our small business instead he go for one last roll of the dice in desperate attempt to cling on to power think people have already make up their mind the government must do the right thing and call general election right now before they do even more damage to our wonderful country obviously hear different budget from the one hear by the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey think that lot in this budget be very good and to be commend as someone who read economic at the london school of economics many year ago understand and appreciate the economy and the challenge that my right hon friend the chancellor have to confront welcome his announcement today as well as the sensible and measured approach that he have take commend he for his performance and his proposal will concentrate on few key issue that be vital for my constituent our country and the whole world have experience unprecedented difficulty in recent year owe to matter out of our control the pandemic and the war in ukraine and the middle east we be suffer the consequence so it remain as important as ever to practise fiscal responsibility as we continue to see the result of the conservative government effort to bring inflation under control grow the economy and reduce debt believe that our country be look towards well future be at the department for education when the right hon member for kingston and surbiton be in the coalition government would ask he to re look at the record in relation to some of what he say inflation have fall from over to the economy be now perform well than forecast wage be increase and we be see mortgage rate come down as we hear from the chancellor our economy have outperform those of european neighbour and the obr forecast that we will meet our fiscal rule to have debt fall as share of the economy that be all positive news and the measure in the budget will enhance it which be welcome very much look forward to see the benefit of today announcement for my bexleyheath and crayford constituent high inflation be bad thing for everybody it affect and cause problem for individual business and community everywhere be rather sorry that neither the leader of the opposition nor the snp spokesperson could even praise the fact that inflation have fall to which be real achievement we will again cut taxis for million work people from next month by cut the main rate of employee national insurance contribution by in the pound together with the cut announce at the autumn statement that equate to tax cut of over for the average worker that be really good news personally have always dislike national insurance as the chancellor say it be an unfair double tax on work therefore what he be do through this budget be create fair system it be the good way to incentivise work which be something we have to do we have to get more of the people who be not work active and into the labour force in my opinion that be the way to drive growth and get fair simple and more understandable tax system which think we would all welcome from april full time national living wage worker take home pay will be great in real term than in due to the successive increase in the national living wage and the tax cut we have deliver particularly welcome my right hon friend the chancellor commitment to support parent have long campaign for change in the system to end the unfairness cause to single income family by the high income child benefit charge family be the foundation of our society we value they and we need to support they as much as we possibly can almost half million family will benefit from the increase in the threshold for the high income child benefit charge with some family no long have to pay that charge it be also right that we look to end the unfairness face by single earner family by move towards household system by april many of my constituent have raise that issue in the past have raise it with this chancellor and previous one so we be delighted that he have listen take it on board and act commend he for that as my constituency and bexley borough do not have an underground people be dependent on either southeastern mixed blessing as it have be somewhat problematic my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel be nod in my direction or their car maintain the cut in fuel duty and freeze rate for the consecutive year be therefore to be commend as be the freeze on alcohol duty which many of my conservative colleague have campaign for vigorously and with justification every time visit two of the excellent pub in my constituency the penny farthing micropub in crayford and the kings arms in bexleyheath assure you that do not do so too often madam deputy speaker they be campaign for freeze it be good news for everyone in the alcohol industry and for those who drink in our pub pub be social hub in our area offer good publican and good company unfortunately we be too busy work to be able to go in too often know that those publican will welcome these measure when they notice they on the news later the other thing be particularly interested in be the new british isa which provide an extra tax free allowance see that madam deputy speaker be nod to indicate that must stop but welcome that additional tax relief for saver and the increase in the vat registration threshold for small business there be so much in the budget that be good so much that will make difference to our economy and our country and welcome it the context in which speak to today budget be one of chaos and instability follow year of conservative failure on the economy this budget have not change the dial the reality be that people will still be bad off after the last year sky ed conway have share graph that he say the chancellor do want to talk about which show that after the budget the uk tax burden will still be head up to the high level since the aftermath of the second world war this be not turning point household mortgage cost be up price be still rise and the tax burden be at year high the chancellor like to speak of stability but he seem to forget that he come from the same party that give we the former prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss who be beat by lettuce and her disastrous mini budget with its impact on our national debt our business our local council finance and our family finance those consequence be still play out and will be for year to come what britain need first and foremost be serious plan for growth we should be in no doubt that our low growth high tax economy be the endgame of year of conservatism the result of the hollowing out of our public sphere the stripping back of business potential and the levelling down of hope official figure show that people be bad off at the end of this parliament than they be at the start the consumer price index average hourly pay for resident of feltham and heston have fall by since when it be around in today price and have fall by since the number of small business in feltham and heston have be fall for the past two year run and be now low than it be in some of child be in relative poverty after housing cost and it be no surprise that the average family will be bad off under the conservatives tax plan give the tory tax rise since the last election but it do not have to be this way that be the point be it not there be an alternative to the choice that the conservatives be make which have leave people in britain worse off while friend and donor do well out of that vip fast lane labour have plan for growth growth that lead to business thrive strong public service more money in ordinary people pocket good and secure job and an end to people and business pay more and get less it be plan for stability and growth that command national and international confidence and make britain the good place to invest and to start and grow business where we become leader in the green economy of the future create opportunity for all under labour we will have stable and competent political leadership and stable and competent stewardship of the economy and we will see the strengthening of our economic institution such as the bank of england the obr and our new industrial strategy council how we do politic and how we govern really matter but under the tories business investment have be lag for year today budget bring more sticking plaster politic but nothing on support for the co operative sector and growth let say few word about skill because we can not grow our economy without invest in our people the big opportunity we have for inclusion productivity economic growth and the competitiveness of our nation be strategy for human talent few year ago boston consulting group report highlight how human capital be under intense pressure worldwide as powerful force globalisation demographic and regional shift and digitisation gain momentum as such nation state need national plan but this budget come on the back of year of failure and give no answer to the skill challenge that we face new official datum from september show worry trend since when the last survey be do the proportion of employer with skill shortage vacancy have go up from to the proportion of the workforce with skill gap where an employee be judge by their employer to lack full proficiency have go up from to and the proportion of employer that have provide training for their staff have fall from to meanwhile the number of apprenticeship start have plummet under the tories by over since with more than billion of the apprenticeship levy unspent since recently visit south and city college birmingham with our superb west midlands mayoral candidate richard parker apprenticeship start in the west midland have fall by over since small business engagement with apprenticeship have drop by staggering since which we must change this decline have not be an equal one in more apprenticeship be start by learner in the bottom of the income distribution now they be start by those in the top the chancellor rightly talk about the productivity challenge with some improvement come from digitisation and artificial intelligence but over half of secondary school in the uk be not even offer computer science gcse in and the number of to year old student take technical it or compute qualification have fall by third since to tackle our productivity we need plan for our young people under labour government britain skill plan will be lead by new national skill taskforce skills england that will go alongside our industrial strategy and bring together business training provider and union to meet the skill need of the next decade across all our region we will recruit over new career adviser for our school and college and deliver two week of work experience for every young person so that young people know the pathway that be available to they we will well support our further education sector to meet local skill need where local skill improvement plan demand it by put in place new technical excellence college we will transform the apprenticeship levy to bring more flexibility up to of the levy will be spend more flexibly on course which be what tesco the co op the british retail consortium techuk city guilds the british chambers of commerce superdrug the chartered institute of personnel and development and many other have call for britain need change and only our change labour party will deliver it with our cost plan for all our policy which will drive the change that we need in our economy our nhs our public service and our community the government be out of idea and out of time more than anything this budget have show that what my constituent need what our economy need and what our country need be labour government as former treasury minister want to thank the chancellor but also other treasury ministers and government departments because know how hard it be to put budget together and the number of representation that be make must thank the chancellor for the due consideration that be polite way to put it that he have give to the representation that have consistently make about supply side reform and low taxis he know exactly what case make on fiscal drag in particular also thank he for deliver great efficiency in government the chancellor have put forward clear plan for the economy make targeted tax cut which will come to in moment and provide support for business and for efficiency across the board include in the public sector on day like today we never get the benefit of discussion of the in and out of the red book and the obr give the assurance that we would all love that if we have much more time but we must all recognise that our economy face fundamental challenge that the budget have seek to address the chancellor understand that he be walk tightrope and that we should also tackle some of the big issue to do with the size of the state and public spending when we look at the rate of public spending growth we see that it have constantly exceed the rate of inflation and economic growth public spending be now in excess of trillion per year which be approximately of gdp be old enough to remember that back in public spending be around to of gdp what contrast that be there be consequence to sustain high level of public spending tax receipt have rise to over trillion and we know what that mean for deliver balance on taxation maintain that the situation be very burdensome we have to get tax rate down however very much pay tribute to the chancellor for listen to comment about efficiency he speak today about public sector productivity plan the detail will be fundamental and really important to hear be really pleased to hear that the chancellor be look at cash saving in public spending across the economy but will also grow aspect of government spending for example there will be an expansion in violence reduction unit pilot across certain government departments have work well and we now have to look at how we get well delivery from public spending and how that can drive real outcome in government have speak to the chief secretary to the treasury about that in recent month and be pleased there be concrete proposal that will take we in the right direction but of course we have long way to go come to the subject of people keep more of what they earn which be clearly fundamental conservative principle this be where national insurance contribution come back into play have see the number and clearly we could move in the direction of low rate of national insurance yet again we have see those rate go down and the debate when the bill come forward will be very interesting back in the autumn be here when only about three people speak in favour of national insurance come down and in support of the legislation on that we want much more support for this measure next week it be important that we get the balance right when it come to incentivise work get national insurance down be fundamental but we must tackle fiscal drag and the number of people who get catch up in high rate of taxation the figure give last autumn would bring million more people into high rate of tax by we will go through the obr and see what the measure mean this time round but the issue be still significant and we know that more work be require in this area it will be interesting to see whether the government will bring national insurance down again in successive future autumn statement welcome the decision to maintain the reduction in fuel duty and we have already hear what that mean for work household have make representation on that issue and will continue to do so fiscal event be huge for business taxation and welcome today announcement on increase the registration threshold freeze alcohol duty tourism and lower corporation tax which have speak about many time we be now tie into oecd rate of minimum corporation tax and my view on that be know want great change so that business can benefit from our brexit freedom would like to speak about many issue today but broadly speak the direction of travel be important hear opposition members speak about local government finance welcome the announcement of million that will be make available through the levelling up fund for cultural project as that will come to my area and to maldon important measure have be announce today it be tough time but the chancellor have announce plan we must stick with that plan and make sure that it deliver for work family in his statement the chancellor mention not just high gdp but high gdp per head there be just one slight snag figure publish today for gdp growth per capita from to be low for every year than figure publish only year ago so we be talk about not high gdp per head but low gdp per head use that as an example we hear the rhetoric and hyperbole of the budget statement but it rarely stand any scrutiny when one read the budget documentation the government can claim that they will meet both their fiscal target at the end of five year rolling forecast period indeed every government could say they will meet their target at the end of five year rolling forecast period but it be what happen in between those point that be important the government tell we year ago that net debt would fall as share of gdp in and that net borrowing would fall below of gdp in however by the autumn statement only five month ago we be tell that debt would not fall until year later and they still forecast that the deficit would fall below of gdp in the same year we be also tell in spring that gdp growth would exceed in two of the next five year and that productivity would sit between and every year across to by november growth be not forecast to exceed in any of the forecast year and the productivity growth forecast be down for every single year today the chancellor announce that while the government would still meet their primary debt target in the percentage of debt to gdp would be high than it be only five month ago so debt be not really fall at well it be stagnate gdp growth would still not exceed in any year to and that be important that be another half decade in which gdp growth will not even reach historical trend growth rate that be absolutely shameful the figure for productivity per hour metric that the government like be low cumulatively over today new forecast period than the figure be that they announce last november the chancellor say this be budget for growth productivity and long term investment but debt be not really fall as share of gdp the deficit be not get small it be actually get bad compare with the forecast last year and productivity growth that perennial problem that we all recognise exist be cumulatively low over the entire forecast period than the government announce last november do the right hon gentleman agree that we have to increase growth we all agree that we have to get all part of the united kingdom grow if he look at the figure from the library he will see that from to england grow cumulatively by wales by and scotland by do he agree that the scottish government need to do more to stimulate growth in scotland agree that we need growth across the piece one of the tool to facilitate growth be tax credit and be sure the minister recognise that tax credit be function of corporation tax if he be serious about encourage growth in scotland the government should devolve business taxation power and power over the associate tax credit we would then see how we get on whatever be say at the start of the statement about growth and productivity and despite the hyperbole the big introduction and all the fanfare this budget deliver neither of those thing as evidence by the number that the government have publish today may commend my right hon friend the chancellor on his budget statement today he be believe slowly but surely get britain economy back on the right track however we have much work to do the united kingdom have no business be high tax low growth and low aspiration nation that be not the britain recognise the people of romford be feel the pinch the overall burden of tax be high than it have be since the second world war council tax be rise in the london borough of havering yet again public service be not even meet basic expectation and local government be struggle to remain solvent the cost of living be hit my constituent hard in the pocket with energy price rocket and the daily cost of food and essential shopping rise to unprecedented level inflation remain acute yet there be little economic growth financial prudence may be an important conservative attribute it be certainly absent from those on the opposition benches but there be nothing less conservative than record high tax burden we can and must do much well hard work family in romford want low taxis high economic growth and good public service those three aim can be achieve only if we adopt robust free enterprise agenda reduce the size of the state at every level and give the british people the incentive to work hard be more productive and maximise our nation potential for economic growth my essex constituent be entrepreneur market trader small businessman shopkeeper and city worker they do not want an economic policy of manage decline but one of heightened ambition and raise expectation that be why welcome many of the chancellor tax announcement today the additional cut to national insurance contribution mean that the conservative government have deliver annual tax cut for the average worker the extended cut to fuel duty will also help hard work people mitigate the cost of the mayor of london who have impose so many extra cost on my constituent child benefit reform will help million of hard work family the reform to stamp duty and the reduction in capital gain will help million of property owner nevertheless the chancellor have repeatedly recall over recent day how the nation with the most economic growth whether they be in north america or asia be those with even low taxis encourage he to far emulate those country success in the year to come low taxis will put money back in the pocket of the british people lead to high growth and more resource for public service my right hon friend the chancellor clearly share that outlook with his announcement today of tax cut investment and reform to boost productivity in the public sector however encourage he to go much far we should follow in the footstep of the thatcher lawson budget that lead to unprecedented economic prosperity in the and we can and must succeed but britain have to be much bold if we be to reap the benefit by become low tax high growth economy once again but tax cut and investment alone will not be enough we need to adopt radical plan to free our economy from the needless bureaucracy that be hold britain back the benefit of become sovereign nation once again follow brexit give our nation exciting opportunity that we must seize to maximise our ability to generate the growth and prosperity that we so desperately need margaret thatcher show the world how it could be do year ago rescue britain from the perilous situation she inherit follow decade of fail post war socialist consensus today we live in post pandemic world but if we be to recover from the consequence of lockdown radical approach be require to jump start our economy and unshackle ourselves from red tape over regulation and government waste britain today be over govern so reduce the size and role of the state must be an imperative for our conservative government regulation and public sector spending do not grow the economy put cash into people pocket or improve public service it be the small businessman and shopkeeper in town like romford along with our entrepreneur and market trader who will generate economic prosperity for the future be disappointed that the unfairness in the local authority funding formula have not be address council up and down the country include my borough of havering be face acute financial pressure the funding formula be unfair and outdated and it be discriminatory against borough such as havering in outer london and essex as it fail to address difference in demographic most importantly it leave hard work tax pay britons without the service they need and deserve that too require ambitious reform ambition be key low taxis high growth reform and deregulation exploit all the advantage of brexit investment and reform of the public sector be the way forward for britain our government have be right to tread prudent path back to economic growth but now be the time to be bold and fearless in the pursuit of the great ambition we have for the british people it be quite surreal to follow the hon member for romford andrew rosindell like he believe in small business but small business growth will not solve the problem in the public sector which have be squeeze during year of this tory government until the pip squeak however good it be small business will not refill council coffer and ensure basic social service and special educational need in school small business will not solve the nhs waiting list or bring school off their knee this government and the government of the austerity year have cause all those problem and crash the economy in september leave family and business crush those who survive the pandemic have face real hardship since this be budget of desperate government another slew of promise that will not be deliver on that be what we focus on in the public accounts committee delivery we look at optimistic sometimes well intentione promise that fail because there be no plan for delivery in my own borough we see such poverty early today in prime minister question the prime minister say that equality have increase and inequality have reduce under his government not in my borough as of child in hackney nearly one in two live in poverty after housing cost be take into account even in inner london we be the most deprive local authority in england there be real day to day poverty invite anyone to join on my doorstep surgery and see the reality let tell the house story about that reality could choose many constituent but visit particular lady just few week ago who live in two bedroom council flat with her husband and four daughter the flat be only marginally big than my office in this building and only bit small than committee room three of her daughter share very small bedroom with bunk bed the toddler share with her parent the bathroom and kitchen be so tiny that two people at time hardly fit they share one live space government failure over housing and brexit mean that child be leave london for my constituent that mean that the local school be close because roll be drop the cost of housing mean that they have no prospect of move anywhere else because of the shortage of property in the social rent sector where more than household be on the waiting list accord to the most recent verified figure only home become available during compare with more than in both of those figure be outstrip by demand the cost of housing mean that many people be be ship out to temporary home rip from their school church mosque and community that mean that my constituent local school be close as be other on top of the overcrowding her four daughter need to move school they be work family who want to do well but they have little opportunity down the road be the product of the government free school policy school with pupil per class member who know how school funding work will know that that school will never be financially sustainable because school be fund on or pupil per class the trust that have take it over from the one that fail be struggle with the finance brand new building have be build but it be unsustainable while other school be close thank to government policy the housing cost across my borough be absolutely wretched so many people be rent privately but unaffordably more people rent socially than privately but they live in overcrowded condition an average two bed rent be just under month there be few privately rent property available now on rightmove compare with before the pandemic and no property available to those on low income at local housing allowance rate this be the real day to day impact of government policy so many people be house outside the borough forgive if misunderstand how our system of government work but social housing in the hon lady constituency be the responsibility of the labour mayor of london be it not do not have time to explain but no it be the responsibility of the council many property be sell off under right to buy which mean that few property be available people like my constituent be live cheek by jowl with people in private rent accommodation often sell to cash buyer if it be above seven storey who pay private rent at the rate that mention the differential be extraordinary and it mean that no one can move from one to the other the social rent housing that be so desperately need because of the cost of buy or rent private housing be not available under this mayor and the previous mayor my borough have be build council housing for social rent as have many housing association partner but because there be no government subsidy every time they build social rent they pretty much have to build another to sell at market rate in order to cross subsidise that be quick lesson in social housing economic that show the detachment because people in this chamber do not realise the reality of life for so many in london let we look at the real human impact there be child in temporary accommodation in hackney enough to fill eight primary school and equivalent to of the borough population those child want to live in london but can not afford to do so not only that but they be be pass from pillar to post from temporary accommodation to temporary accommodation and move school regularly this be squeeze on opportunity for those at the high end who might be able to get on to the housing ladder the lifetime isa be an opportunity miss in the budget because it provide support only for property purchase of up to nationally that rate be high in london but even that do not cover the cost give that typically brand new two bedroom property cost who be able to afford that on public spending the chancellor merrily talk about reduction in spending in most departments have not have time to go through the red book in detail but we see huge drop the home office budget alone be go down significantly which be concern consider all the challenge in policing immigration and other security issue that it have to deal with and we could look at education too all those budget be reduce there be big nastie out there in every department that will cost money for whoever be in power there be the civil nuclear decommissioning and rebuilding of our nuclear power station the nuclear enterprise and the cost of decommission nuclear submarine we have not even decommission one of those the first will be do in and that be become an urgent crisis there be pupil in crumble school these be just some issue where input be need on the school budget the department for education want billion year to build the new school that be necessary but it be grant billion we have already see its capital budget reduce the chancellor talk about public sector productivity and reform the public accounts committee which be proud to chair examine that endlessly and too often we see optimistic plan that do not deliver as say he be already spend what he be promise to deliver on that let tell hon member that this take long time we need reform and digital transformation but we can not deliver those change and budget saving overnight we need long term approach slow politic if you like where both side of the house whoever be in government agree that some thing just have to happen and should not be at the whim of government who be on their last desperate stage to try to prove that they have something to offer the british public the hon lady be make an excellent speech about all the thing that be not in the budget do she agree that the big miss opportunity be not invest in the green transition there be so many miss opportunity the child benefit issue be mess of this government make they have now break the independent taxation rule and that be problem this government have break britain my constituent be bad off than they be year ago and bad still they have no hope we need to see government who will deliver hope opportunity housing and school improvement and cut waiting list we need to mend break britain we need general election and labour government now single budget rarely in itself make substantial difference or be remember however budget that be part of story and sense of direction be important and can help to continue narrative and build vision in my view this budget be one such occasion clear vision of where we want to go particularly with regard to tax and growth last autumn the chancellor start this sense of purpose and set out direction first support business with full expensing and secondly support those in work with reduction in national insurance this budget continue that direction of travel and fully support it further reduction in national insurance will be welcome include by all those in work it be the equivalent as have be say of per annum and there be the help for the self employ if be to make one suggestion to my party as it continue this narrative look to its manifesto and commitment at the next election it would be to reduce national insurance far and ultimately to abolish it fully agree with the chancellor that simplify the tax system especially for those who be in work should be priority some of the other budget measure include the freeze on fuel duty help all motorist the alcohol tax freeze the expansion of childcare and further support for business with the vat threshold rise and full expensing extend to leasing of course there be also public sector support with new doctor additional nurse and new police officer which demonstrate our commitment to public service however budgets can not be see isolation and there be plenty of other thing go on unemployment remain historically low which benefit family and individual up and down the country the living wage will rise by real term high than it be in inflation be at and will fall far it will probably be well below by the summer which will allow interest rate to start to fall it be not all about work pension will rise by around that be benefit of the triple lock which have take more than pensioner out of poverty however the ultimate goal be growth in the economy we have fare well than many of our european partner but clearly we want to see growth right across all region of the united kingdom to achieve that we need the correct ingredient at both the national and local level investment skill low taxis and less regulation all lead to high productivity and therefore wealthy society give the local example of my constituency of carlisle which be extremely well place to grow significantly through national and local support there be more than half billion pound worth of investment in place progress now or about to be undertake that be transformational investment digital investment for modern economy million improvement to the link road which will improve connectivity locally and right across the region railway station undergo refurbishment which will bring it into the modern age and make it the region gateway to everywhere university that will be locate in the city centre help to regenerate the city centre and grow the local economy as well as create the skill of tomorrow and medical school open in which will improve the health economy as for the talk about housing always tell people to remember that we do not have national housing market the market be regional and we still have affordable housing in carlisle which be an attractive place in which to live and work on the back of that we have garden village with new home which will allow the city to expand in an appropriate way in my view carlisle demonstrate success at the local level investment skill development well connectivity low unemployment and room for growth that be level up in action the budget be part of the equation that can help to achieve and support growth in carlisle and across the country support it because it set out that we be go in the right direction for both our country and of course my city of carlisle this be budget for job preservation the preservation of the job of conservative mp in marginal seat it be the epitome of short termism and sticking plaster politic it be not what britian need and be afraid it may not be enough for the conservatives to get themselves re elect there be five area on which will briefly touch on behalf of the people represent in plymouth the first be housing be disappoint that there be not more on housing to help people get on to the property ladder especially in area of acute housing stress in the far south west there be real pressure on house price both for rent and for sale the area have be decimate and hollow out by second home and airbnbs although welcome the change to the furnished holiday let regime they will not deal with the scourge of second home which be hollow out our community and leave they empty for much of the year plymouth have housing crisis which be compound by the fact that the rural and coastal community around we be experience an even deep housing crisis with lack of affordable housing would have like to have see more in the budget to support council such as plymouth city council which want to build build build want to see more density in our city centre and hope the government can support council such as plymouth city council labour run council with plan to build great density and thousand of more home next to transport hub place of work and our vibrant city centre want to see more from the government but there be not enough in the budget the second area be nursery welcome the possibly transformative change that government focus on childcare could bring about help people back into the world of work be really significant but worry that not enough preparation have be do to get it right in only few week time the new policy will be implement but there have not be enough effort on skill on recruitment on retention or on the viability of nursery especially small nursery in poor community we be only week away and really hop the chancellor would have support those nursery that want to expand their provision but can not afford to do so that be especially true in community such as mine where parent can not afford the compulsory top up to give their kid place in nursery care that be simply not good enough thirdly on the keyham bomb members will have see the incredible effort make over the past few week by our armed force the police plymouth city council and other to support the community after the discovery of world war two bomb want to thank everyone who put their life on the line especially the royal navy and army bomb disposal squad the incident highlight particular treasury problem however the existence of an insurance loophole that insurer can use and have use when bomb be discover in exeter few year ago to claim that policy be not valid due to an act of war that war be year ago and would like to invite the government to speak to and my right hon friend the member for exeter mr bradshaw about how we can sunset that provision to ensure that anyone who buy an insurance policy for their household or their business know that they be insure if the bad happen because let face it there be still thousand of undiscovered world war two bomb out there fourthly want to see more support for care leaver think this matter to all of we in this house there be opportunity to support care leaver which frankly do not cost much money particularly get their first home after they leave care on their birthday national rental deposit guarantee scheme and national rent guarantor scheme would fundamentally transform the life chance of young people leave care because they do not have access to bank of mum and dad or someone to guarantee their rent in their first home in the private sector work with barnardo we estimate that this will cost million to set up that be lot of money but in the big scheme of thing million to change the life chance of all those thousand of young people in care would be money well spend and would like to see the government look at that finally would like to see great fair share for the far south west whichever government sit on those benches after the next election they will be form of mps from the south west of england and would like to see the regional variation in spending address in plymouth we get above average spending in one area of government spending and one area alone and that be defence we have the large naval base in western europe in the constituency represent and be proud to stand up for our armed force but on health education skill transport and housing we be below average there be no reason why any child in plymouth should be worth less than the national average and we need more fairness in our system to let they achieve their true potential this be pre election budget and think the public will see through it it be not the long term plan that we be look for mortgage payment be high the weekly shop be more expensive food bank use be up inequality be up the tax burden be the high in year and our economy be in recession this be give with one hand and take with the other one thing be clear it be time for general election and look forward to the prime minister put out his lectern without the logo on in the next two week and let the people decide who they want to be in power it be time for fresh start it be pleasure to follow the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard and echo what he say about the emergency service they do an extraordinary job remove that bomb in what could have be horrible situation however have listen to what the opposition be say and have listen in vain for an actual plan instead we seem to be hear whole series of shopping list item with no sense at all of the economic reality of the moment the economic reality be very straightforward over the past four year we have deal with the big public health crisis in century the big security crisis in europe for year and an international resurgence of inflation and rise interest rate and still we have an economy that be do far well than the opposition say it would we have an economy that still have some of the low level of unemployment for decade that be turn corner that be forecast to grow and that be attract investment we be no in the world for attract inward investment we have hear today about astrazeneca plan in cambridge and on merseyside those be good news story and they be happen because this country remain good place to do business and place that attract international organisation to base themselves here none the less we be country like those in the whole of the western world other european country face the same challenge and the answer be not simple or straightforward have listen to the opposition and they seem to be suggest that there be magic solution and that the world would be fine if they somehow transform themselves into the government of the day well can assure they that in the unlikely event of that happen they would face all the same issue the difference be that they would get the solution wrong instead of bring down taxis and take step to drive investment as the chancellor do in the autumn statement they would do the opposite they would put up taxis put up public spending and stifle our economy which be why they do not offer solution for the future it be why actually labour government would be profoundly damaging to this country we need to remember that back in we inherit million unemployed people and rise include million unemployed young people here we be year later with historically low level of unemployment yes there be challenge in the labour market will talk little about those but of all the economic challenge that nation can face have always believe that unemployment be the bad because unemployment create real human misery the fact that we do not have the level of unemployment that we inherit year ago be huge plus for this country the reality be that we need to return to some of the principle that we put in place back in because we have too many people outside the workforce and too many people on long term sickness benefit at that time we have some very proactive programme to help those people back into work and think we need to recapture that in the aftermath of the pandemic one thing that be not solution be system without sanction as the opposition propose ultimately those who can work should not be sit at home on benefit even the vast majority of those on sickness benefit have the potential to return to work perhaps to do something different from what they do before with the right help and support they can get to well place nobody benefit from sit at home on benefit for the rest of their life it destroy life and destroy health if there be no stick to go with the carrot we will achieve far less than we should the idea that an alternative be provide support without consequence for those who do not take it be simply nonsense we have to get back to proactive carrot and stick approach the welfare state be ladder that people should climb it be not place in which they should live be sorry to see that we be put up taxis on air passenger albeit in the high class this will ultimately drive traffic out of the united kingdom people will interchange on the continent or in dublin because it be cheap hope that the measure will be temporary and do not want to see further measure that drive down the uk sector competitiveness at the same time be very pleased to see the investment in help the development of sustainable aviation fuel the chancellor announcement early this week be welcome and necessary because as say at prime minister question this be an essential area for the aviation sector which can take serious step towards net zero only if it transform the fuel it use both for long haul flight and in the immediate future sustainable synthetic aviation fuel be the only way in which it can take such step towards net zero do not want to see situation in which our industry buy all of its fuel from other country as say early the united states be currently the source of sustainable fuel for uk airline which might be fine right now but we have to take quick step to ensure that we have an industry in this country that require over the come month the department for transport and the treasury to work together to accelerate the process of set out plan for the saf mandate and price support mechanism so that immediately after the election whoever be in power can put the plan in place straightaway that be essential for the future of the industry in this country and it be not just about aviation it be about job in part of the country that need job hope the treasury will put its foot on the gas to make sure that sustainable fuel happen quickly hope the department for work and pensions will be bold in step up its support as well as step up the consequence for the long term unemployed who refuse to accept that support in difficult circumstance think those in the treasury have produce pretty good balanced budget for which commend they be conscious of time madam deputy speaker so will not be give way in this short speech as someone who passionately believe in free market and small state find the national debt figure in this budget truly appalling let we be clear we have go from position where our national debt figure be just prior to the financial crisis to one where it be close to today that be two and half time increase most of which have come on conservative majority government watch of all thing there have be tribulation but there have also be huge misstep since that mean that we have see an increase in national debt equivalent to that of the first two year of the second world war when we be fight for our very life against the nazis no one can say that anything in this period remotely approach that in the and government of the day have an excuse they be still recover from the economic dislocation of the second world war we have no excuse for this appalling financial mismanagement apart from our indolence and lack of political will what have go wrong would set lot of the blame at the door of george osborne and the public school dye in the wool establishment clique who run the modern day conservative party in and we have huge opportunity to reset the relationship between the state the individual and business which be the only mean of grow the tax base in this economy so call austerity be nothing more than reduce increase in government expenditure government should have be make slim and fitter and supply side economic should have be the core of everything we do instead we have george osborne talk about park the tank on labour lawn if we look at the ipsos polling we must ask how have that work out the second reason we be in the state we be in be that we have fail to grasp the opportunity of brexit it should have be an opportunity to deregulate en masse to make our economy fitter and strong and to out compete the europeans instead our very first move post brexit be to impose vat on tourist which have be devastatingly counterproductive it be just an example of the way in which we have fail on brexit we have lose and we have show absolutely no will to grasp those opportunity if we be go to support brexit we have to do it properly that be the only way to have do it if we believe in it we have fail in our will as nation as the borrowing figure show this be in addition to the fiscal and monetary policy we be addicted to debt and print money in order to not face the hard choice which could be golden opportunity as result this country finance be more vulnerable than they have ever be we be no long part of the european financial ecosystem we be alone all we be do be borrow more and pay ourselves more for produce less unless the supply side be properly tackle by bold government can see this nation be back at the door of the international monetary fund just like it be in say that we be not as bad as the italians be joke this budget be suppose to be do or die but from look at the document and the wide polling we see that it be more not do and then unfortunately we die the cry shame be that at least blair have to work for his landslide finally reflect on my last word in this place before choose to recuse myself voluntarily they be frankly have have enough official report december vol have be speak to the british people on the doorstep and talk to my constituent and be sorry to say that that be precisely the verdict that will be deliver on the government in the very near future it be rather sad to follow that speech from the hon gentleman remind he that one year financial crisis one in century health crisis and one year international crisis in europe all contribute dramatically to the problem he outline although may be on the same side as he when deal with the public school tendency in my party do not blame they on that point will my right hon friend give way of course absolutely every opposition have its day would just like to say that we be not all that bad might return to that shortly the truth be as my right hon friend the member for epsom and ewell chris grayling say the chancellor have do skilful job in deal with an extraordinarily difficult backdrop think there be more thing he could do will talk about that in second although much of that be down to the structure of government decision making rather than his fault for example as the leader of the opposition say we be deal with world in which putin have weaponise supply chain and destroy the economic basis of our anti inflation policy that have work for the previous year understand the chancellor caution and his desire to retain the confidence of the market against that it be remarkable that he have take billion out of national insurance at about head for million people and for another million self employ people frankly people be underestimate the success the government have have with inflation reduction and employment for most of my time in this house the idea of new job day every day for an entire government tenure would be extraordinary that certainly do not happen under the previous labour government so we have quite lot to be happy about that say if have my way would not have go for national insurance would have reduce income tax why lot of assertion have be make in the public domain probably in relation to the treasury that national insurance be less inflationary than income tax that be bogus nonsense the only argument to support that be that cut national insurance will pull ten of thousand more people into the employment pool but so will cut income tax because income tax apply to people above the age of cut it would also keep highly skilled and capable people who we do not want to retire in the workforce would have prefer an income tax cut rather than national insurance cut but that be what we have get and it be probably much well than we would have get from the opposition while be talk about income tax want to make one point en passant at every budget have raise the question of which be oppressive on small business and the self employ it drive people out of the country the public accounts committee be look into that issue and hope it will come up with conclusion some time soon will keep at the government to deal with and the related issue of the loan charge frankly his majesty revenue and customs be behave in barbaric manner reminiscent of the post office so will continue to raise that issue want to raise number of structural matter my right hon friend the member for wokingham john redwood make the point be go to make about the bank of england the current structure of the bank of england its guideline and its rule be flawed in big way they handicap the way government can operate on fiscal policy and on inflation we need to address that and my right hon friend make good point about that there be also the issue of the obr george osborne create the circumstance under which the obr almost set the guideline and the fiscal rule for the government the government be then terrified of what the market will do if they do not follow the obr attitude understand the prime minister have picture of nigel lawson in his study he ought to read lawson because lawson view on economic forecast of any sort be that they be pseudo technical nonsense he do not believe in forecast and we would do well to learn from he the whole british establishment be suffer from collective delusion about the amount of authority that rest with obr forecast in fact with all government forecast let give the house an example the bank of england forecast fail to predict the bad inflation crisis in modern time in the obr uk borrowing forecast be more than billion repeat billion off the mark last year the office for national statistics not in forecasting but just in measure announce revision that add billion to the size of the british economy panmure gordon turn round and say that it have completely rewrite the story of post covid britain which it have new report on the obr have suggest that since the combine total of the obr error in growth forecast aggregate to over billion and its error in forecast public sector debt accumulate to more than billion this be the mechanism that chancellor be use to decide how much tax they can afford to cut to remind people the fiscal rule be that there should be reduction in the percentage in that be the difference between two guess it be not rational way to run an economy be particularly strike by the change to capital gain tax and the reference to the laffer curve do my right hon friend agree that it be disappointing that the obr in particular still do not appear to look at dynamic impact of tax change in way that be essential for the future order intervention be absolutely marvellous but can those who have already speak be conscious that we be try to get everybody in with equal time my advice remain six minute per speaker sir david davis will notice that he be already slightly over that have one last thing to say as will cut what be go to say about productivity one rule that use to apply in this house be something call general amendment arrangement which come after the budget that disappear in which mean that we can not change the budget except in very very narrow way this probably should be point of order rather than part of speech plead with member on the front bench to ask the chancellor whether we can have general amendment arrangement at the end of this budget have hear some of the speech from conservative members suspect that although they have give some welcome to this budget there be great deal of disquiet about it be sure they be all hop that the chancellor would come out with conservative budget that give they banner under which they could march towards general election instead we have what can only be describe as an old mother hubbard budget although the chancellor would have love to have throw bone to the electorate nice juicy bone that they could bite on so they would be happy to vote conservative at the next election in effect the cupboard be bare the cupboard be bare not because of the mismanagement of previous government but because of the mismanagement of this government who have be in power for year from costly lockdown that be badly think out and whose economic consequence be never consider to the ongoing billion be spend on net zero in the belief that somehow or other we can alter the world climate to the failure to take up the opportunity of brexit and the staggering tax burden under which the economy be now stumble and fail to grow all that be the result of decision that be make by the government and this budget be manifestation of the consequence of that at first sight it seem that perhaps there be much good in the budget the reduction in national insurance for example until we remember that the figure in the red book and the figure from the obr show that the impact of that be wipe out by the stealth tax which be impose on the uk population as result of not move tax threshold the vat threshold lift for small business from to do not even begin to take into consideration inflation over the period in which the limit have be in place have inflation be account for the child benefit threshold would have be lift from not to but to so stealth taxis be still be impose even though they be present as improvement welcome the fact that some small business will be lift out of vat that people will pay less in national insurance contribution and that squeeze middle income family will have additional money which will hopefully encourage they to go into work but once the headline be strip away one see that the budget be not quite as generous and the bone be not quite as juicy as the chancellor would have we believe will mention couple of thing relate to northern ireland welcome the barnett consequential for northern ireland and the fact that the town fund have be extend to coleraine will be interested to see how the global trade arrangement will help firm in my part of the united kingdom to expand their export potential the renew stormont assembly however face underlie difficulty past assembly can be criticise for not have take tough decision successive sinn féin ministers in the department of finance we have have three of they do not even bring forward budget that could be agree and allow spending to get out of control however the treasury accept that the funding formula that apply to northern ireland differ from the formula that apply to scotland and wales which have lead to huge fiscal gap do not believe that one part of the united kingdom should be treat differently in that way it be disappointing that that be not address in the budget welcome the fact that we have not have an increase in fuel duty as northern ireland be much more rural and more reliant on lorry to bring good in and out fuel duty increase would have add significantly to cost and to inflation the government make policy announcement and talk in the budget about new capital allowance but when his majesty revenue and customs implement they they sometimes do not work as intend the chancellor should look at that in the last budget research and development allowance be give hundred of firm have be turn down for those allowance on the basis that they do not comply with the criterion or whatever one wonder whether the treasury take different view from the government let not lose too much revenue let make the process much more difficult as result of bad management there have be little room for manoeuvre whether we be to have another conservative government or labour government the great concern be that the budget store up huge problem for the future cost that will explode and unresolved issue to do with compensation that will still have to be pay it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson and particularly my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis who make an important speech particularly as regard the obr it be tell that the chancellor start his speech by point out at least inadvertently it be not deliberate attack how many thing the obr have get wrong that be real problem for policymake because we treat the forecast as if they be holy writ authoritative and right we make decision on comparatively small amount assume that the forecast be fundamentally right and that everything will add up but of course it do not let we look at the increase from to in the vat threshold that be an absolutely splendid and fundamentally good policy it make life easy for small business be thoroughly welcome and cost million or of budget of trillion the cost be utterly trivial yet the government do not go far say that they can not afford to of course they can that amount be rounding error when we consider the total of what the government do unfortunately that be the problem with the whole approach as far as it go it be perfectly good the economic circumstance have be tricky and we spend billion on support during covid which be the right thing to do but rather than nickel and diming as be happen we need to look at the fundamental of our tax and spend policy that trillion be of gdp that we be spend that be too much it be more than the country can afford that be the starting point it mean that we be tax too much report in the daily telegraph state that we will not quite reach the figure for tax as percentage of gdp that we do in we will just swerve have our high level of tax in the post war period but that figure show that we be spend too much we need to get spending under control so it be pity that the chancellor stick with the real term increase in public expenditure we should be make public expenditure flat in real term and we need to recognise that the good way to afford public expenditure be through economic growth matter for rejoice know that the people in north east somerset will be delighted and the chancellor mention this be that at least the obr and the treasury have be willing to look at particular tax to see if cut it make thing well the tax cut from to on property own property refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests so the change may be beneficial to but moreover it show that laffer work when even the treasury and the obr come round to think about it where else could that be do the hon member for solihull julian knight mention the tourist tax it be the easy tax for the government to have get rid of we know all the evidence be there that it cost the economy and the treasury money yet the treasury plough ahead with the obstinate view that tax rate produce set amount of tax which we know to be false go back to when tax rate raise much less money than tax rate ultimately do that be why be not at all keen on the attack on non dom the obr forecast expect immigrant net to come to this country every year up to that be build into its forecast we need to get control of that on the one hand we need to get control of people come in and undercut the british workforce lower wage in area such as social care on the other hand we want as many billionaire as be willing to come because they be small in number yet contribute very largely to the economy attack they and make thing hard for they might be mean of steal the labour party clothe but it be not good economic policy doubly so because post brexit other country france in particular have actively set out to drag those billionaire into their country france italy and portugal our old ally yes absolutely other country be compete for the very rich who will go to those country rather than come here be also not in favour of the extra tax on oil company we need more oil and gas one of the reason why our productivity have be low and our economy stagnant compare with the united states be our much high energy price we need to wean ourselves from the green ideology which be make we cold and poor and be one of the big factor to undermine economic growth in the past year we should not be attack the oil company we should be welcome and encourage they the time limit be very tight but there be good news that members will like time on the finance bill be unlimited so look forward to resume my comment on second reading the house will be surprised to know that will talk about not billionaire but ordinary people in my constituency of kingston upon hull north for whom this budget provide very little the budget also provide very little investment which we desperately need in hull and the humber it expose the reality of what levelling up actually mean for the north as we come to the end of this parliament it be trifle it be not transformative the chancellor mention canary wharf that be not an area in need of level up the hull and east riding devolution deal come with headline catch funding of million but it be spread over year that be million year share between two council that come nowhere near reverse hull loss of million year since that stand in direct contrast to the government economic transformation and integration deal with rwanda which come with at least million over five year an average of million year for level up in rwanda will focus mainly on what be not in the budget any compensation for the infected blood victim that be despite the fact that member of parliament from party write to the chancellor last week ask he to make an announcement on the allocation of funding for those people and it come after this house defeat the government in december by vote to set up compensation body through the victims and prisoners bill congratulate my right hon friend on her excellent work on the contaminated blood scandal on behalf of all our constituent do she agree that it be heartbreaking for child to have watch their parent go through this my hon friend who have also campaign on the issue over the year make good point will come to that minister receive the final recommendation on compensation from sir brian langstaff in april they also receive the framework compensation document from sir robert francis in april which allow they to prepare for compensation to be pay however today there be not even an allocation for further interim payment to alleviate the immediate suffering of parent who have lose child and child who have lose parent let give the house an example of what that look like sam rushby whose entire family mum dad and three month old baby sister all die of aids by the time he be three have receive no compensation and would benefit from the interim payment that sir brian langstaff have recommend that the government pay paragraph of the obr document confirm that it have not be able to take into account plan for compensation for contaminated blood victim as no money have be identify by the treasury for that compensation the obr seem to have miss the point that sir brian have already make his final recommendation on compensation and the government do not need to wait until may to decide what to do next the chancellor view have evolve over time on june ann dorricott the widow of the chancellor late constituent mike dorricott who die because of the infected blood scandal say in evidence to the inquiry that her husband be tell in february by the chancellor do worry about this we sort it on july the chancellor tell the infected blood inquiry that it could be see as huge failing of democracy that victim have wait so long for justice after the first interim report from the infected blood inquiry which set out that the government should pay interim payment the current chancellor write to the government on august with two fellow former health secretaries state the victim and their family deserve nothing other than the complete and immediate acceptance of sir brian recommendation to refuse to do so would simply continue the injustice thus far hand out by the state to group of innocent victim condemn to year of suffering and neglect any delay to such payment for instance by argue that we need to wait for the inquiry to finish for new prime minister or for parliament to return will sadly almost certainly see more of the victim die before they see justice by the time the chancellor appear at the public inquiry on july his view have change he then say it be very uncomfortable thing for to say but can ignore the economic and fiscal context because in the end you know the country only have the money that it have and that can give you sense as to the timescale to play politic with victim of the infected blood scandal be frankly unforgivable those infected and affected be not responsible for the economic state of this country and the government have already accept the moral case for pay compensation the approach that minister be take be tin eare with no allocation in this budget for compensation they tell we that they be work at pace but they be not meet with any of those infected or affected or take sounding from any of the campaign group they be hire expert to advise they and refuse to give the name of those people and decision be be take behind close door this be not the way to treat people who have suffer and be dismiss and ignore for decade the way this government be behave be shameful rise to welcome many element of today budget notably the cut to the main rate of employee national insurance from to the change to the high income child benefit charge which will help half million family and the raising of the vat threshold for small business from to speak on behalf of many small and medium sized business in fareham know that they will warmly welcome that change however the real test for we today be to ask ourselves whether the measure that have be announce will turn the tide will they turn the tide on the high tax burden in year since world war two will they turn the tide on our prospect of galvanise the british economy and stimulate growth after decade of sluggish productivity will they turn the tide and send the message to british taxpayer that we the conservatives be the party of low tax and on their side those be the real question that we need to ask ourselves honestly and with dispassionate fairness because if we be not honest with ourselves we have no one else to blame if we hand the key of power to the labour party want the british people to know what that will mean for they labour government will mean tax rise to fund billion worth of uncosted promise opposition colleague be shake their head but it be true labour government will mean undo brexit and align the uk more closely with the european union and open our border to potentially unlimited number of people from the eu just as night follow day labour government would also as every labour government in our history have do leave this country with more unemployment and more job loss than when they enter government that be something do not want to see and be incredibly proud that since this conservative government have create job day that job miracle be something that conservative members can all be proud of it will bring huge prosperity and wellbee to million of people across the country our approach as conservative must be one of responsible management of the public finance yes we want to cut taxis because that be the way to stimulate growth and then reinvest more tax revenue in deliver first class public service be very proud of our track record on public service delivery over the past decade whether it be the increase number of doctor and nurse the phenomenal improvement in our literacy and numeracy rate in english school or new police officer be proud of many of the outcome that we have produce thank to our commitment to our vital public service just in my local area fareham community hospital have see an increase of new service from new chemotherapy unit to same day access to gp service and regional renal dialysis centre all in the last few year and there have be million investment in new accident and emergency department at our local queen alexandra hospital to be fair to the government thing have be incredibly tough and challenge over the last few year needless to say we pay the wage of million of people to in effect stay at home be very proud of the furlough scheme but do think that we all need to reflect again dispassionately and fairly on the decision we make during the pandemic my own view with the benefit of hindsight be not absolve myself of any responsibility because sit in cabinet at the time of these decision be that we actually do spend too much we do lock down too soon and too hard and we do shut school in way that be harmful rather than helpful in the event of similar pandemic hope that we do not make the same mistake again do not blame anyone it be time of unprecedented fear and uncertainty but think we have to learn the lesson so that in the event of something similar happen we do not repeat those decision think we overreach overspent and overcompensate for what could have be handle in less damaging way for the economy and for the british people in the medium term return to the budget if we be serious about put the british taxpayer first personal taxis be good place to start which be why welcome the change to national insurance however agree with my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis as my preference would have be cut off the basic rate of income tax an increase in the personal allowance and raise the income tax threshold to properly fix tax regime that have be sad to say become disincentive to work and endeavour in too many case cut of off the basic rate and an increase in the personal allowance say from where it currently stand to or even to or would have help poor household and lift about of all taxpayer out of tax altogether cut income tax rather than national insurance would help broad range of taxpayer include worker saver and pensioner let say word about pensioner yes they have the benefit of the triple lock but it be fair to say that since the income tax bill of the retire have increase by hundred of pound some estimate put it at the value of the triple lock have actually be deplete because of the fix threshold in income tax and in particular the personal allowance do regret that income tax be not choose as the tax to cut over national insurance because pensioner have lose out as result think those threshold need to be raise to tackle the invidious problem of fiscal drag we have see too many worker million in fact on low or middle level salary be drag into high tax bracket in way that be never intend nurse teacher and police officer be pay rate of income tax which be never the plan because the frozen threshold have not be raise in line with inflation it have be prove that that be disincentive to promotion and to work long hour and it be reason why many more people be choose to take early retirement or to work less that be drag and have an adverse impact of our tax system think this be miss opportunity and hope the prime minister remember the promise he make during his leadership campaign that he would plan to cut the basic rate of income tax eventually in this parliament how do we actually pay for some of these tax change agree with my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg that we really have to start question the validity of the forecast and the assessment make by the obr one way that saving could be make be in look at net migration and overall level of legal migration be very pleased that the obr seem to have shift away from its orthodox view which have traditionally be that more people come into the country largely on low wage be necessarily net benefit for the economy just last month david miles of the obr attenuate that view by say that no we can not assume there to be fiscal benefit from increase migration there have be assessment that the uk have pay billion since to cover the cost of non work migrant and the ifs have confirm that non eu net migration have have net fiscal cost overall get net migration down be key to save cost would have like to have see many other area include such as cut public spending which have be mention already overall this budget have some welcome element but it also represent something of miss opportunity to properly send message that we be on the side of the british taxpayer that we will lower taxis and that we will galvanise the economy to produce growth year after year have rise in this chamber as the government water down their commitment on level up transport and living standard and now it seem there be nothing much leave to water down every year have call for urgent action to prevent the collapse of our national health service and now the prime minister admit that his plan have fail the government profess that they stand for law and order but systematic cut have see confidence in our justice system plummet just as poverty peak during this government cost of living crisis they have create month of uncertainty over the household support fund for vital service such as foodbank today budget reach the pinnacle of year of cynical short termism under this government from level up to healthcare the budget fail to deliver for the people of bradford south last week the prime minister go on so call levelling up tour claim that level up be about provide people with well opportunity to work travel and feel proud of where they live in year what opportunity have this government give to people in bradford south network north be shell of the broken promise that be once proudly hail as northern powerhouse rail in bradford rather than be offer new high speed rail line and enhance connectivity we be tell to celebrate the announcement of new platform at bradford forster square that be not the ambitious and transformative northern powerhouse rail that be promise no less than time by this government despite all the talk bradford south have not see penny from the levelling up fund the opportunity to level up this country have be squander with the government have betray the north with their fail levelling up agenda what have become of the self profess party of law and order the prime minister continue to argue that the government plan to make our street safe be work recent report show that across half the country not single break in case be solve that be no conviction in half the country let be clear that speak to the systematic underfunding of our police the conservatives be fail on basic requirement of government to protect our home the police should be fight crime not fight for funding if our street be less safe what be the government do for the national health service more than people across bradford be now on nhs waiting list for treatment and the prime minister have admit that he have fail on his pledge to cut waiting list the nhs be cry out for funding but today budget do next to nothing just two week ago visit yorkshire ambulance service station in bradford south speak to the mechanic who work miracle on an old fleet keep ambulance on the road for up to year and far beyond their recommend lifespan fix those ambulance be not always possible and it often lead to skilled paramedic crew be strand and unable to do their job of save life the ambulance service be cry out for increase capital investment but new ambulance just like the new hospital be an illusion under this government we need healthcare service that be fit for the future and will care for everyone from the cradle to the grave today budget will do little to help the nhs over year this government have preside over persistent decline just think about what labour achieve when we be last in government the short waiting time in history crime down by third the cancer guarantee half million child take out of poverty the national minimum wage the winter fuel allowance record result in school and peace in northern ireland that be record that britain could be proud of that be britain under labour government in six minute it be difficult to put all the good thing about this budget in my speech but will try will start with the context we face the bad public health pandemic for year we take that on and make some difficult decision because boris johnson want to save frail people from die we sometimes forget how scary and difficult it be deal with that pandemic admit that be somewhat sceptical of lockdown and vote against it time but we can not impugn the government motif they be try to save life certainly in the first year when we do not quite know with what we be deal an awful lot of the additional money be fund to keep business afloat some of which have go on for generation and to keep people in employment through furlough what we see today be fairly full employment in this country and lot of that be down to the fact that the government invest money in people when there be national emergency lot of the problem for the government over the past year or two be therefore the consequence of lockdown its cost and the implication of that for public service with people work from home and so on the first thing would say be that thing be start to normalise in the sense that we be get fall deficit national debt be likely to fall and growth be likely to pick up over the next two or three year as result of that for the second fiscal event in row the government have be able to cut taxation for million people who be in work that be to try to improve the incentive for those in work and that be to be welcome however the chancellor have balance to maintain because the most important thing be not just to cut tax but to get interest rate come down inflation be likely to be in the next month or two and that afford the bank of england the opportunity to cut rate some people in the city think that will probably be on three or four occasion as we go into the summer if we end up in situation where we have inflation at or and pay increase of or and we have tax reduction through national insurance and fall interest rate inevitably the standard of living of many people in this country will go up that mean that people will have more money to spend and the economy should be able to grow there be plan and it be work do not think single budget make much difference but it do make difference when we have fiscal policy set out over two or three fiscal event and budgets that want to take thing in particular direction admit be bit of an obr sceptic black hole tend to disappear and then arrive often it produce figure that be wrong but on the whole have body to give an independent view reassure market be bit of bank of england sceptic too the comment of my right hon friend the members for wokingham john redwood and for haltemprice and howden sir david davis be right we need to look at the bank of england remit growth should be in there as well as inflation an interesting thing be that we still pretend that the bank of england be independent the reality be that because of that we do not give it precise advice on what it should do with the overhang from quantitative easing my right hon friend the member for wokingham make the important point that we have lose billion or billion on bond that the bank of england buy to get we through covid and that be largely about timing if we sell bond when interest rate be fall we get well bond price and if we sell when interest rate be rise we get bad bond price the tax cut in this budget on national insurance be worth about billion the bank of england by mis time the selling of bond it buy in quantitative easing have so far waste five time that if one think of world in which we have not have to pick up that bill and we have delay get rid of some of the bond accumulate with quantitative easing to time when interest rate be fall the tax reduction we could have introduce today would have be far more ambitious hope that as interest rate fall the loss will fall from sell bond and quantitative easing and we will get into well fiscal position be sure there be room for another fiscal statement before the next general election if there be look forward to further tax cut as we go ahead hope it be not news to anybody in the chamber that the public trust in politic and politician feel very low right now many people have be tell that they do not feel their voice be hear in politic so ahead of the spring budget do piece of work in my constituency survey my constituent and go to meeting of pensioner and group of young people to ask they what their economic priority be and have match they against what we have hear in the budget thank all the village newsletter and local paper that carry my survey which mean have detailed idea of what my constituent be concern about if we listen to ministers crow over fall inflation in recent month we would be forgive for think that the cost of living crisis be over but the high in inflation be because of the decision make by the government and that mini budget response to my survey from my constituent make it abundantly clear that the cost of living crisis be not over in the hundred of reply receive more than tell they be bad off than they be five year ago so the message to the chancellor must be that the cost of living crisis be not over but very much real and people be really struggle right now high energy cost be the most frequently mention issue in the survey and have particularly affect elderly and disabled constituent be tell chill story by constituent about the step they have take to reduce their energy bill some have tell that they have turn off their hot water and heat completely even on the cold of day due to the increase price other cost commonly mention be food price and mortgage my constituent steven from lancaster buy his first home last summer but the mini budget and the spike in mortgage rate mean that he be pay hundred of pound more out of his wage every single month that be money he would like to spend on dental treatment his nhs dentist close but he can not it be money that he need to spend on his massively increase energy bill but he can not that be really good example of the problem face by so many constituent in different circumstance common theme that pop up time and again be pensioner struggle to make end meet people dependent on support from their parent or other family member to pay the bill each month and people tell they be just about manage but really struggle to meet one off cost such as the car or the washing machine break down as one constituent put it we be not live we be exist want well for my constituent and want well for the country yougov poll commission by the joseph rowntree foundation find that three quarter of brits be worried about the current level of funding for public service that be very much reflect in the concern raise by my constituent no one will be surprised to learn that most concern be reserve for the nhs with long waiting list and the poor availability of nhs dentist come up time and again however constituent also raise funding for school road and public transport and the local authority who be really struggle to deliver those public service on the ground in my constituency pay tribute to all my local council lancaster wyre and lancashire which be run by variety of different political combination but all face incredibly difficult financial settlement there be real fear about the impact that reckless tax cut could have on public service across lancashire come on top of more than decade of tory austerity in the survey one constituent say tax cut will not save our impoverished public service could not say it more clearly than that my constituent be also concerned about the level of inequality we see across the uk there be the idea that energy company do not pay their fair share and yet when constituent get their energy bill they really struggle to meet they one sum it up reduce taxis for the well off as pre election booster do nothing to help ordinary people with soar food and heating bill can already see email come into my inbox from pensioner who be unhappy that the change to national insurance do not benefit pensioner who be really struggle while the triple lock go some way it do not compensate for the rise cost of living and inflation spiral out of control janet from pilling be desperately hop to hear something from the chancellor about redress for victim of sodium valproate both her son live with lifelong disability have be harm by the drug she have hold out hope give that from his previous role as chair of the health and social care committee the chancellor know the heartache and financial cost pay by those victim she be disappoint that there have not be an announcement today regard redress particularly because as understand it the government have have an early copy of the report on the subject by the patient safety commissioner for england for several month urge the ministers on treasury bench to respond at speed to that excellent report and to do the deed to match the chancellor word on this matter on redress associate myself with the comment of my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson on infected blood also want to raise the matter of the justice need for victim of the horizon post office scandal have be contact by many constituent who work in the hospitality sector include liz who run the fantastic cafe dolce in lancaster she highlight the difficulty that many business face because of rise cost she want tailor support for the hospitality sector but fear she will be disappoint with today offering be we well off now than we be year ago the resounding view from my constituency be absolutely not taxis be still rise price be still go up in the shop and mortgage rate be high and nothing that the chancellor say today change that it be time for change it be time for general election it be pleasure to speak in today debate strongly welcome the measure announce in the budget we hear about increase investment and growth be pleased that the treasury committee will scrutinise the obr and the chancellor next week it be important that we consider the bank of england policy on sell gilt which my hon friend the member for poole sir robert syms refer to and the impact for the obr and the room that it give recommend that hon member look at ed conway the sky journalist for more on that be sure that will open their eye in many way enjoy the measure on investment in life science the speke factory in liverpool be get massive boost which will have welcome impact on job the budget respond to sme by add lease to full expensing the ongoing activity of the department of business and trade and all of government show that britain be open for business welcome the measure on pension when be work in the dwp with my hon friend the member for hexham guy opperman who be then pensions minister we be concern about the poor return for define contribution saver welcome the progress in that regard that have be set out today the british isa be brilliant idea and look forward potentially to invest in one myself the overall outcome of the budget be to make work pay national insurance be tax levy on weekly income the current threshold be week which be equivalent to just over hour week at the current national living wage in suffolk coastal we have lot of seasonal worker the national insurance cut will be welcome to they because during the summer month when there be an increase in the hospitality sector employer be often look for more employee combine with the cut that be already apply to people pay packet the average saving be per person which be significant those on low income should bear in mind that when the prime minister be chancellor he cut the universal credit taper rate to that provide significant boost to make sure that work pay welcome some of the sensible change to help with that the fact that job day have be create since we come into power in be truly astonishing and show how important it be to get people into work and keep they in work my right hon friend the work and pensions secretary will continue to work on that particularly consider the impact of covid also welcome the assurance on childcare have new nursery opening on april in leiston in my constituency call spring in response to the government support wish daisy plumridge well another aspect that my constituency will particularly welcome be the abolition of the furnished holiday letting tax regime as visitor be an important part of our economy too often the measure have become way to in effect subsidise people buy second home with the extra income from let the property out for part of the year it be wise that we have consider the matter there have be few thing along the way but think this significant change will ensure that we have professional landlord who think about family and the long term expect suffolk will welcome the tax relief extend to freeport east recently visit felixstowe port alongside the new maritime minister the noble lord davies of gower number of pub in my constituency and indeed the brilliant adnams brewery will welcome the freeze in alcohol duty hope that more of my village hall will take advantage of the million fund investment the extra million in section of the red book for internal drainage board will provide useful boost to the important work do by local farmer also in the red book be pleased to see reference to the consultation that we launch in march on tax relief relate to those enter environmental land management scheme it have be the case that people only get agricultural tax relief from generation to generation on land that be actually farm that be an unnecessary barrier and welcome the change that will come into effect from april next year the support for tenancy be also important for our countryside to deliver efficient economic and effective outcome for user of public service it be important that the government get the public sector productivity plan right be think of the nhs in particular in my short time as secretary of state for health and social care we start to look at why there be so many agency worker the nhs as many on the ground in hospital and other part of it will know can be an exceptionally inflexible employer it be no surprise that quite lot of people turn to be bank staff or go to agency hope that the plan be not just about do an economic exercise this be about culture and leadership in our hospital the variable performance around the country which we have make much more transparent show the change that good leadership can make that be often drive by culture as well as high expectation and be to be welcome say to those on the front bench that that it can be too easy to be locum exclusively look forward to vote for these measure this be budget for growth and to make work pay and look forward to its being support by the house today be very much miss opportunity much have be say by colleague particularly on the government benches about level of debt and tax but the fundamental issue go back to the financial crisis in have be failure to deliver sustainable economic growth we hear much from the chancellor today about growth and productivity but when we dive into the detail it simply do not add up as my right hon friend the member for dundee east stewart hosie say the starting point be gdp per capita in many respect the starting point for today debate should be what have be happen over the past couple of year if we take the period since march gdp per capita have fall by as much as indeed the obr tell we that household income will not get back to the pre pandemic level until the harsh reality for all our constituent be that they be poor we have hear all the brouhaha today about cut tax and we have have some criticism of the obr but we need set of forecast on which to base the decision that we take accord to the obr forecast for the next five year period the average gdp growth per annum be one and two third per same level as it forecast last november for all the change that have take place there be zero movement on the needle on expectation of economic growth hope that we have more detailed discussion on these matter member have touch on the issue of growth and would say the issue of productive potential in the uk let we have debate about where that productive potential be and how we grow the economy because quite simply do not see that in what the government have come forward with today these thing be base on the obr book as have be talk about but let we look at the detail the headroom that the government have be let we be honest limited and be base on an assumption that the fuel price escalator take place every year from now well it have not take place since in that sense what the government have tell we today about their headroom be an absolute fantasy tax as percentage of gdp be go to hit at the end of the forecast period we hear many tory mp say that tax be come down no it be not all that be happen be that some of the tax increase be be ameliorate fiscal drag have be much talk about but the forecast be that the fiscal drag from the failure to increase tax band will result in billion tax take so let we have some honesty about what be go on where be the plan for growth where be the plan for an industrial strategy be glad that my colleague in the scottish government be take this issue seriously we will have an industrial council much have be say about labour plan now backtrack on for billion of green investment but we need to recognise the scale of the opportunity to decarbonise the economy and create job let take the example of green energy in scotland we can increase our green energy output fivefold and create up to job if we do not do that other country will make that investment and benefit from the opportunity in green energy we need to grasp those opportunity and ensure that we can transition the economy we need to ensure that we be create the circumstance whereby people want to come and invest here let turn to public spending again in real term public spending per capita over the next few year will be flat of course that come after many year of constraint on our public service take into account the investment go into the ringfence area notably the nhs between now and the real term decline in public spending will be what be it be about billion we often hear people say that austerity have not happen my goodness look at our constituent and the cut that be take place look at local authority in england and the challenge they face the government be take out billion over the next few year what be take place be absolutely shocking interruption hear somebody chuntere from sedentary position about scotland but at least we have try to ameliorate some of the effect of the cut we have invest in the child payment to drive people out of poverty the harsh reality of this budget be that there be no hope for people in scotland it be more of the same low growth no increase in productivity no vision and no investment in the green economy say to voter in scotland that come the general election bring it will have choice government in scotland who have focus on invest in an industrial strategy for deliver the new green job for the next generation or more of the same from broken britain and more pressure on public service that be the choice that people in scotland will face on the back of this budget the chancellor in his excellent speech mention that he would unleash million worth of level up hon member may guess the subject to which will briefly allude which constantly mention in this house there be bit of level up in lincolnshire worth million which be the levelling up that we be hop to achieve at raf scampton the most iconic raf base in the country that levelling up would involve use foot runway and superb heritage building that be the home of the dambusters and the red arrows so appeal once again to the government to listen to have be beg they for the last year to agree to compromise on this see one of my lincolnshire colleague on the front bench the exchequer secretary to the treasury my hon friend the member for grantham and stamford gareth davies and be sure that he have certain amount of influence on his fellow member of the government hope that the government will listen to what have be say for the last six month which be that we should compromise by take some migrant on small part of the base and unleash the rest of the base for level up that be what lincolnshire need more than ever it need more job and more growth and hope that this be budget for that this be debate about the budget not about illegal migration but this whole saga of put up more and more people in hotel or in military basis must end we have to get the rwanda bill through parliament we have to have proper deterrent and we have to stop these people who be make joke of our border control but the far more serious problem than illegal migration be legal migration when enter the house year ago net legal migration be run at about year twenty year later it be year and now it be over that put massive strain on the economy the fixation on import cheap labour be immoral and unpatriotic we can not undermine our own worker by let in people and pay they low than average wage there be single thing that the chancellor could do and that would be to end all the shortage scheme and simply insist that if someone want to come and work in the uk they would have to earn the uk national average wage of roughly as minimum not only do such an influx of people drain our economy displace investment in domestic skilled work it also put an immense strain on public service with more british citizen than ever include the least advantaged struggle to get gp appointment and secure school place for their child we must deal with net legal migration it be the single big problem face our government and we have to act on it we know that we be import all these people because we be not pay enough to our nhs or care staff we therefore have to import people from all over the world but there be million people of work age in the uk who be claim benefit and that statistic be set to rise remorselessly productivity rate be decrease and they be project to fall far in the come year we have to address this fundamental weakness of the british economy we be not pay proper wage to our people we have too many people of work age on benefit and we be import too many people from the rest of the world on the broad case have be listen to what my colleague have say and would have prefer cut in income tax to cut in national insurance that would have be much more dynamic and people understand it also many people do not pay national insurance include saver and people of pension age there be no point in keep the triple lock if we be drag more and more pensioner not rich pensioner into pay tax and sometimes into high rate of tax would have prefer cut in income tax rather than national insurance but understand where the chancellor be come from on that want to say word about the office for budget responsibility can not understand why we seem to have outsource so much of our economic management from the chancellor of the exchequer to the obr and the bank of england people say look what happen when we do not listen to the obr in the disastrous mini budget but the reason that that budget go wrong be not that we do not listen enough to the obr forecast which be often wrong but that there be too many unfunded tax cut as nation we have to become dynamic low tax low regulation economy that be the only way forward for conservative government be very dubious about these obr forecast generally we should not put too much faith in opinion poll which be simply test of opinion what will matter in the come general election be that people have choice we accept that we be pay too much tax we accept that we have be hit unbelievably badly by lockdown the pandemic and the war in ukraine and we accept that people be regulate too much but when my constituent go to vote in may november or whenever will ask they do you want to pay even more tax do you want even more regulation and even more migration to this country the answer be resounding no so speak for myself shall be vote conservative it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh and to hear about all the challenge in his constituency there be nothing more important than give child the good start in life first go into local politic through the sure start movement many of the woman volunteer with back then be now senior in early year provision and it be wonderful thing when we get it right last sunday in an interview on the bbc sunday with laura kuenssberg the chancellor say that he could not guarantee that work parent of two year old would get their promise hour of free childcare it be simply not good enough to see yet another broken government promise the chancellor announce the free hour this time last year whole year ago and they have still not be deliver my constituent gillian have two young child and she find out in january that her local nursery be close down due to lack of staff she write to we be inform of this yesterday afternoon immediately stop what be do and start call nursery and childminder in the area must have call childminder none of which have availability imagine her panic when she know that she would either have to give up her job move house move in with her parent or work part time parent be already hard press whether it be because their mortgage have go up their private rent have go up by overnight in the past month or they be wait for social home to become available family in hornsey and wood green be face extreme pressure what good be free hour if family can not find nursery that be still open the free hour need to be properly fund yet so many early year setting have close as hear from councillor brabazon who run child service in haringey borough many childminder have leave the sector due to lack of support from the government how will the chancellor provide parent with more free hour if nursery can not recruit or retain staff how will he prevent nursery in my constituency from close down will he guarantee that every eligible child will get their free hour in april or will he move the goalpost again and move the date to september or perhaps september delivery seem to have an ever move boundary he continue to move the goalpost at this rate child will be in secondary school before they have adequate childcare provision as well as the need for affordable and accessible childcare there be the problem that thousand of child live in unsuitable temporary accommodation include hotel due to the government abysmal housing policy this be not new problem and it have be bother many member the government refusal to scrap section and build social and affordable home have contribute to the mess there have never be more child in poor quality temporary accommodation which be cause desperation for so many in some case as the press have report in the past week child be die in temporary accommodation london borough be now spend million month on temporary accommodation accord to london councils and more than londoner be homeless and live in temporary accommodation include child on average there be at least one homeless child in every london classroom it be an absolute disgrace that we be spend so much money on temporary accommodation it be mainly housing benefit when that money could have be turn into the brick and mortar of new home up and down the country family be feed up with the government break promise and incompetence this budget will do naught to fix it only labour have plan to break down the barrier and provide child with the good chance in life we need an end to the tories stick plaster and an end to rishi recession we need general election and labour government rise to welcome this budget low tax budget focus on increase productivity in our public service by goodness do we need it yesterday have dinner with an old friend who have spend quite some time out of the uk we be talk about what he feel life be like in the uk now and he say that he feel that society be become infantilise when ask he what he mean he talk about the ever increase intrusion of the state and other body into the life of ordinary people when ask he for an example he decide curiously to talk about the railway he have get train the other day and he be tell on several occasion to mind the gap to contact the british transport police if he see something suspicious to ensure that he have the correct ticket for his fare and to see it say it sort he be tell that on loop about time one might think why be he talk about these safety announcement surely they make sense but it be not as if my friend be about to leap into the gap or pick up strange package it be not as if he be plan to evade his fare the british state or the institution in question seem to want to tell that individual about the danger constantly we be over regulate over tax over govern and over leverage both at state level and individually thank goodness we have budget that will try to address some of those problem we desperately need low tax economy and productivity in our public service there be no clear example of the over burdensome intrusive and nannying element of the state than peterborough city council its administration would rather axe lollipop lady one of the only physical manifestation of the city council leave on our street than tackle inefficiency in its back office or look to make saving through productivity it would also rather demolish or at least close three bridge we can count they over local beauty spot know as cuckoo hollow thus in effect cut off hundred of people from shop and prevent they from go about their business many of those people be disabled many have mobility issue and many be elderly the council would rather do that on spurious health and safety ground than take common sense approach and repair each bridge individually one at time instead the council would rather close they overnight and not tell single soul about it more people have walk on the surface of the moon in the past year than have be place in any sort of danger by these bridge but that show the sort of council we have our council would also rather fence off local open space call werrington field because it have some sort of concern about safeguarding it would rather close swimming pool the regional pool in peterborough where learn to swim because again it have take an over cautious approach in response to survey it have take the bad case scenario as be the letter of the law the council would rather close it than make do and mend we have planning system that treat people who want to build small granny annexe or small addition to their house as though they want to build st paul cathedral or the taj mahal next to their house rather than something that would obviously benefit the local economy and that individual family we need to accelerate supply side reform to planning and to get peterborough and this country building we need to take more mature approach to politic and to how we talk about the economy and public spending be incredibly proud of the investment hundred of million of pound have manage to secure for future infrastructure in my city of peterborough we have not have our fair share over many year however we talk about spend commitment as if the amount we spend be itself the goal but what we really want be outcome we say we be spend more than ever before on and but spending be not the goal the outcome what we get for our buck be the goal along with productivity that be the sort of change we need to see be incredibly pleased to hear that point make very clearly in the chancellor excellent speech nowhere do the productivity challenge embe itself more than in our national health service so be pleased to hear about the public sector productivity plan there be three thing we might think about to increase the productivity of our nhs first the consultant clinician nurse doctor and people we pay to care for patient must operate at the top of their licence be disappointed to hear disparage comment from the opposition about the prime minister view on physician associate we want more physician associate in our national health service so that consultant doctor and nurse can do what they need to do and operate at the top of their licence secondly we need to streamline ranking and grade in our nhs to ensure that people can move from one element of the service to another more easily that will increase productivity and job satisfaction finally organisation such as the national institute for health and care excellence and programme such as get it right first time tell we what work and how to do the good for patient but the nhs do not adopt that advice at pace or at scale we need to follow that advice to increase productivity in our nhs hope that the public sector productivity plan address some of those issue if we continue with the infantilisation of our society where will it end it will end with the labour party one of the two great political party in our democracy mandate policy that tell people that teacher be there to brush child tooth where do the responsibility of the state end and that of parent begin if we be mandate teacher to brush child tooth in school we have long way to go to create an independent and non infantilise adult population in this country rise be grateful to member for stick to six or seven minute as dame rosie suggest we do not want to impose formal time limit if we can get away with not do so but the informal time limit would mean that everyone get in and have roughly equal time it be pleasure to follow the hon member for peterborough paul bristow be afraid that this budget will make little positive difference to his constituent or mine or to the country at large the cut in national insurance announce today will not compensate for the interest rate rise my constituent have have to suffer or for the plan announce by conservative in harrow council to push up council tax by some in the come year the obr confirm today that living standard will stay below those of for at least another two year mean less money in my constituent pocket in family budget and for our high street the budget will do little to reverse the sustain under investment in public service in harrow or across the country every school in my constituency now have less funding in real term than in on average school in my constituency have see reduction in real term since of almost per pupil in real term more than million have be cut from school budget since in harrow west the four high school in my constituency have be hit particularly hard see real term funding cut of between and almost per pupil and the primary school have see cut in their spending power of between and almost compare with the excellent pinner park primary school which be lucky enough to attend have see real term cut per pupil of since and loss of almost in spending power many school in my constituency and indeed across the country face huge problem recruit and retain teacher and other staff in my constituency that be due in no small part to london housing crisis have always want to see the inner london allowance for teacher extend to outer london to help deal with the recruitment crisis in my constituency and other part of outer london there be nothing in the budget to deliver the level of investment that school in my constituency deserve on special need funding although welcome the small announcement that the chancellor make today ministers still do not appear to have grasp the scale of need in harrow which have traditionally be poorly support by conservative and whose problem have now be exacerbate by poor conservative administration just of education health and care plan be issue to support young people with significant special educational need within week which be low than rate in barnet hillingdon and brent conservatives ministers have three time reject bid for funding from harrow council for another urgently need special need school for extra place that shortage of locally provide appropriate special educational need and disability place be force the use of expensive private school place cause transport cost to rocket and cause parent of send child the ever present worry that their child place will be take away or that they will have to settle for placement that be not fully appropriate it be also place heavy pressure on mainstream school which be not get sufficient extra funding to ensure that some of their send pupil be properly support parent of child with special educational need be tell that the council locally know that this be mirror nationally do not have the resource or staff to complete those education health and care plan in good time the parent of one young person in my constituency await second occupational therapy assessment in order to complete an ehcp that be start in june last year have just receive letter to say that ot assessment will be delay again because the service be run at reduced level support for child with special educational need be in crisis and this budget be not offer the investment necessary to bring new hope to the thousand of family who have be let down by the government failure to invest over the past decade in britain next generation the nhs in harrow be on its knee nationally one in every seven people in england be on an nhs waiting list which be more than ever before that mean they be put their life on hold have to manage in pain and discomfort for month for far too long try to get an appointment to see gp in harrow have be struggle for too many people in sign of the scale of the crisis in access to primary care understand that new system for urgent gp appointment be be force on all gp surgery across north west london no consultation on that plan have happen up until now and independent medical advice suggest serious concern about patient safety flow from it it would have be far well have the underfunding of the nhs not lead to the closure of be to pm walk in urgent care centre in my constituency they ease the pressure on gp surgery and crucially on accident and emergency service one major nhs reform that would make an immediate difference locally be for an investment in expansion in intensive care bed at northwick park hospital which serve my constituency from bed unit at the moment to bed that would help to ease the huge daily pressure on in what be the busy hospital in london for blue light ambulance visit make no criticism of the staff there they be do an impressive job sadly though this be budget that will see further cut in the support available from the nhs and lack of investment in our school too hope that even at this late stage ministers will find way to begin to put that damage right we be on day one of the four day in which the house will debate the chancellor budget statement but within minute of the chancellor sit down we hear opposition party roll out their headline soundbite such as look where we be after year of tory rule suspect we will hear lot of that in the lead up to the next general election which be fast approach in the hope that the wide geopolitical context in which we have have to govern be completely glossed over that simply trivialise the importance of this debate so let we do it justice and appreciate what have actually happen over the past year we have have to endure the large global pandemic since it cost more than billion to protect our economy and vaccinate the nation we continue to endure the bad war in europe since which be impact both the continent security and its economy with global oil price have increase by uk wholesale gas price have rise by and food price have spike follow ukraine grain export disruption that be the monetary and fiscal backdrop the challenging context that we find ourselves face today it sit behind the cost of living crisis with double digit inflation and have lead to the unprecedented but necessary colossal state intervention that we be now slowly move away from look at the situation that we inherit year ago uk debt be rise the deficit be about billion year and unemployment be high than in labour would rightly point out that it have to endure the global financial crisis that hit britain hard but that underscore my point about the context of the global economic headwind that we have have to face of course would like to see more money to far ease the burden on household tackle the waiting list and upgrade our defence posture but the reality be that the conservatives have have to manage the uk economy through the tough of circumstance during which time there have be success that should be acknowledge include investment in our school the roll out of free school and academy our jump in the international league table and the roll out of the pupil premium and free school meal our welfare structure be far simple fair and well target with transformative free childcare as well national insurance contribution have now be cut to tax cut for million people on the green economy our agenda be world beat the fast decarbonisation of any major economy and the first to legislate for net zero target we hear today that there will be further step as we invest in the modular nuclear reactor programme thank to the tax break and investment incentive we have the third large tech sector in the world behind the united states and china we be global leader in pharmaceutical life science quantum computing artificial intelligence and aerospace as well as fintech and financial service back up by some of the good university in the world crime be fall police number be now rise violence reduction unit to tackle knife crime which have be campaign for with the chancellor be now be roll out include in my constituency of bournemouth new generation of hospital be be build with upgrade to exist hospital such as we be see in bournemouth there be more doctor and more nurse the levelling up programme be transform community up and down the country include bournemouth seafront and we be on target to build million new home in this parliament on defence and security we have expand our surface fleet with two carrier we have upgrade our air force and our continuous at sea deterrence programme we form the national security council as well as the national cyber security centre and sign up to aukus we have host summit and the nato summit and have play lead role in ukraine as well as defend safe maritime passage in the red sea so please do not say that it have be waste year that be an insult to the british people it have be challenge absolutely and not without frustration can say that at first hand but have labour be in office without benefit of hindsight would it have fare so much well than we bear in mind that the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn he be in his place would have be at the helm for some time he would certainly have take britain in very different direction think he would acknowledge that will the right hon gentleman give way do mention the right hon gentleman so will give way yes it would have be very different direction there would not be the level of poverty homelessness and inequality that we see in this country today give the right hon gentleman the opportunity to put his word on the record look forward to hear what he have to say here be the rub it be not likely to get any easy in britain global storm cloud be gather again our world be become more contested and more fragmented we face evermore test time ahead with increase threat to our international rule base order the question be who be well place to strengthen our economy to navigate we through further global shock and to lead the country with inflation now fall head towards rise business confidence return education standard improve and the uk grow fast than most of the other member of the this be clearly budget for growth which we should all support it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for bournemouth east mr ellwood be glad that thing be go so well in his constituency wish it be the same in batley and spen today budget be an opportunity to get britain back on track to unlock our great potential and to begin the important work of get britain future back sadly however this budget fail to address the deep root economic challenge that we face and the government have to accept some responsibility for that in particular for the chaos of the past five year when we have see five different chancellor such political instability be damaging to business family and community to be fair to the current chancellor he have the unenviable task of try to tell people that everything be go to be okay when for many people that be just not how they feel many people be struggle to make end meet people who work full time be have to use food bank and everywhere they look thing be just not work whether that be the bus or the train get support for their child with special educational need or with their mental health or access doctor or dentist so many people in my yorkshire constituency tell that they feel significantly bad off than they do year ago if mention level up they often simply laugh hear of the daily sacrifice that people make the hard work people put in but the feeling be that this hard work and sacrifice be just not pay off they see prime minister who have implement tax rise since alone give we the big income tax burden for decade they know and feel that this economy be just not work for they people want to see and feel real change but know that they will be sorely disappointed to hear this budget that will not even scratch the surface of the challenge they face like people across the country family in batley and spen have face tough couple of year the disastrous mini budget of see their mortgage repayment and their weekly outgoing include the cost of their food shop spiral out of control one family speak to recently where both parent work full time have to find an extra month for their mortgage the national insurance cut will simply not cover that mean that they will have to sacrifice pay for precious family activity or will not be able to pay for their kid to go on school trip that be the reality for many people as result of the political choice of this government who remain intent on blame everything and everyone else for their mess the government can not pretend that the conservatives mini budget be anything other than an economic disaster for which we be all now pay the price minister may celebrate that inflation just about halve last year but the reality for family in batley and spen be that food price go up by last year and be still rise today while our economy have now dip into recession regularly in this place we rightly pay tribute to the dedicated volunteer who give up their time to run our increase number of food bank but it be not acceptable that over the past decade we have somehow manage to normalise their existence as though food bank be something to be proud of it be not just family that be feel the pinch small business in the town and village represent be find it incredibly tough recently meet local landlord and landlady who face increase overhead which they simply can not pass on to customer and consumer who have their own cost of living pressure some local pub have already close and more be under threat will turn now to the pressure on local authority about which we have see much in the news over recent day kirklees council have lose over billion of funding since and be face unprecedented financial pressure the government must take responsibility indeed if the conservatives have keep labour funding formula kirklees would currently be in surplus instead like many other council kirklees be have to make cut worth almost million just to balance the book so once it have fulfil its statutory obligation on education refuse collection and social care it face the impossible dilemma of choose which leisure centre library town hall mental health service or registry office to close the impact on my constituent be devastating luckily we have manage to save batley sport and tennis centre but the battle for cleckheaton town hall and other vital local service continue the budget should have ring fence money for sport and leisure facility library and town hall those thing be not nice to have they be essential part of our community infrastructure and we need they to keep the population fit and healthy reduce long term pressure on the nhs they be the key to happy healthy and well connect community more broadly local government funding need fundamental reform the current funding formula be not fit for purpose and mean that local council face either extreme hardship or potential bankruptcy no matter which party control they local government be often the most direct interaction that people have with politic and it carry huge burden in ensure that local service work for resident fail to fund those service properly be cause backlog of issue that we will eventually have to pay for anyway the current situation be unsustainable and do not make economic sense so ask the chancellor and the levelling up secretary to urgently reform the funding formula to ensure that adequate funding reach the area that need it most for basic service which be the glue that bind our community together the budget be miss opportunity to begin the work of rebuild britian reform our community and unleash our potential to get our future back after year of financial and economic pain it be an opportunity to reset and get our economy work for our community again instead all we get be few tweak couple of gimmick and few shiny announcement design to distract from the flatline economy which be the fundamental issue impact people daily across the country include in batley and spen sincerely hope that the shadow chancellor my right hon friend the member for leeds west rachel reeves will be deliver the next budget in few short month to deliver the change that we so desperately need to get britian back on track rebuild the relationship with our local authority and get our economy work once again for family across the country it be pleasure to follow the hon member for batley and spen kim leadbeater the test that be go to give the budget before hear it be how do this help my constituent particularly those who be still struggle the most with the cost of living crisis in fact think that be the priority for the chancellor we have see inflation start to come back down to where we want it to be interest rate have come back down from their peak and the economy be probably perform slightly well than we have fear although not as well as we might have hop so be certainly hop that he would not take any risk that might destabilise that position and would focus on what he could do for those who most need support that be pretty much roughly what we see steady as she go budget that focus on those issue certainly welcome measure such as the time extension for pay back universal credit advance and the extension of the household support fund which be good way of target fund at those who will need they most over the next six month clearly the single big decision be the extra off national insurance that decision will help people to keep more of what they earn make work pay and improve household finance so strongly welcome it like many would have prefer change to income tax such as raise the personal tax allowance which would have help those earn the least quick than percentage change but this be not time to be picky it be an expensive measure but it be welcome one that will really help people and we should not ask for perfection in many budget speech have ask can we have sense of direction for what we be try to do welcome the increase of the vat threshold to after long pause but it would be help if we peg it to something be we try to give self employ person median income after incur cost but without their being in the vat regime be that what we be try to do be that where we should try to peg the threshold otherwise we be just pluck random number out of the air occasionally it would be well to have the right starting position and to index it every year to give some predictability have ask for that sense of direction we actually have one on national insurance it appear to be the chancellor view that double tax income through two different taxis be the wrong thing to do and he seem to want to phase out national insurance when we can afford it that be welcome sense of direction but if he really think double tax be the wrong thing to do he could stop it more quickly by abolish national insurance put more on income tax and just have one tax the revenue we would get from tax more passive income at slightly high rate would probably pay for low rate on earning so we would not have to make it literally could probably get away with slightly low rate in that situation if we be be radical and that be the direction we want to go in the chancellor could perhaps look at dust off the old exercise on whether we really need those two taxis to be separate if we really believe that it be wrong to tax work high than other form of income it seem slightly incongruous on the same day to reduce the capital gain tax rate on the sale of second property that show how hard it be to have simplistic view because we finally have dynamic assessment that show that if we lower the rate we get more activity and more revenue it would seem rather perverse to reject that and want to have principle that give we less money so think welcome that change even though it look slightly inconsistent on the face of it will use my last couple of minute to welcome couple of other small thing the fuel duty freeze be hugely welcome by my constituent who rely on their car quite significantly also welcome the alcohol freeze which be largely welcome in try to help the hospitality trade have call for the abolition of the non dom tax regime in about the past three budgets so welcome the fact that the chancellor have do so be expect little fudge this time perhaps he would reduce the number of year that person could claim it from to or increase the amount they have to pay to access that regime but announce complete reform of how we tax temporary resident and non resident be absolutely the right thing to do our regime be completely out of date resident non resident ordinarily resident settle habitually resident domicile non domiciled do not think anybody understand what on earth all those thing mean have one modern regime where everybody who be long stand resident pay the same taxis be absolutely right it be fair to say that if somebody come here temporarily to run business or start one or on an exchange with an employer we do not really want the hassle of work out their whole worldwide situation because by the time we work it out they will have leave anyway have short term exemption and then much clear more modern regime that provide certainty and fairness be the right way to go and much more defendable than the historic regime which depend on where person father be bear how on earth could we defend that in the modern day welcome the fact that the chancellor have grasp that nettle in proper coherent way and look forward to see the final detail of those change when the consultation take place in similar vein welcome the reform to the child benefit charge think that when the chancellor say that two people earn would be exempt he be hint that he think be the right place to set the household income level but he do not actually say that look forward to the consultation establish where we think the long term correct position be think would be fair place to put it overall welcome budget that be probably about the good that could be do give that our deficit in the next financial year be billion for those who think we could be spend more or tax less ask they how big deficit we can really be run and for those who think that rely on five year forecast be bit risky would say that sense that rely on the one year forecast would get we very different budget think the chancellor have find the right balance and that we be go in the right direction and look forward to support the budget resolution next week ask the house one question how can it be right that in the sixth rich country in the world more than million of our child be live in poverty and the rich of household earn or receive an income over time that of the poor in my borough in which some extremely wealthy people live one in four people live in poverty make we the sixth most deprived borough in london in other word there be other borough that be less deprived some people in my borough experience high level of food insecurity be delighted that the mayor of london have pledge free school meal across the whole of the city even though my borough have be provide they since it be huge step forward we have very high rate of child poverty with of our child live in poverty this budget could have do so much to reduce level of child poverty and improve the livelihood of some of the poor people in the country which be why intervene on the right hon member for bournemouth east mr ellwood in the way do we have what think be an immoral and disgraceful two child policy on benefit level in this country which mean that child in large family lose out large family be already often poor because they be large and they be then make even poor by the discrimination against the third fourth or even fifth child in the family it would not be madly expensive to end that policy and it would take child out of poverty it would cost billion the chancellor announce that the non dom abolition which agree with would free up more money for tax cut in the future but that could have be use to end the two child policy in very neat synchronisation of two policy change the chancellor could also have look at page of the obr report which tell we that there be now estimate to be billion worth of uncollected taxis in this country that be more than double what it be five year ago and the figure be get bad and bad it seem that in this budget the chancellor be more interested in appeal to small number of people with some degree of tax cut through lower national insurance but ask this question be it fiscally responsible to plunge more family or more people into desperate poverty than at present quarter of million people in this country be homeless and more than million household be on social housing waiting list most young people have no chance whatsoever of be able to rent somewhere of their own because rent be simply too expensive and they have to share they can not even think about buy anywhere and they have almost no chance of get on council waiting list unless they have either large number of child or quite complex medical condition or stress level we have housing emergency we see that emergency every day when we come to this building and see homeless people on the street of london beg those number be increase as time go on as my hon friend the member for hornsey and wood green catherine west point out the amount of money we be spend through public expenditure on housing benefit to subsidise very expensive private rent accommodation be part of catch up every year the local housing allowance rise bit the landlord raise the rent bit more and the public have to pay this exorbitant level of rent why on earth can we not have rent control private sector rent control which be pretty normal across most european city and indeed in part of the united states in my borough we have household on the waiting list for social housing the only way forward to deal with the housing crisis be not to pledge to build million of home as the government be do but actually to pledge to build council housing at secure and affordable rent to guarantee decent quality housing for people this country do that under both party in the two decade after the second world war and then we have the thatcherite idea of sell off social housing which be very nice for those who be able to buy it very cheaply at the time but every other generation since then have pay the price of that policy ask the government why do they not give priority to the housing need of the majority of the population and those in desperate need recognise the effect on child poverty the effect of underachievement in school and the effect on society as whole of the very poor quality housing so many people live in the underfunding of local government have enormous implication when the government say they be very pleased that britain be an attractive place for art and culture that be wonderful and absolutely agree want we to be an attractive place for art entertainment and culture but if they cut local government expenditure the art centre get underfunde the perform art suffer and the whole cultural scene suffer as result as do so much else know you be concerned about the time mr deputy speaker so will conclude with letter that the leader and deputy leader of my local authority in islington kaya comer schwartz and diarmaid ward write to the local paper in plea to the chancellor before the budget they make several point first they call for more realistic local government funding so that they do not have to cut service or reduce they in some way they be do that and they have lose million due to central government underfunding they ask for rate to build much need new council home the council have do well on build on land that it own but it can not afford to buy anywhere else or it must build mixed development with less council housing than we could have they also ask for full flexibility about how the money could be spend we need much more responsibility put on to local government to spend the money as they see fit and that will help with the housing issue finally while the chancellor say great deal about the nhs he do not mention social care at any point in his speech for many social care be crisis with many family devastate by its cost many woman have to give up their job career and hope because they must care for elderly relative or those with profound disability we can do so much well in this country than we be do this budget be not welcome at all it be huge miss opportunity it will come as no surprise to the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn that while it be pleasure to follow he do not agree with many of his suggestion do agree however that housing be one of the define issue and while might not agree with his propose solution it be certainly something we need to address it be worth look at this country economic picture in context during this parliament we have have once in century pandemic and the return of war between nation in europe for the first time since with the result price shock send through the world economy we must look at the context we be operate in rarely mention in speech from labour members when we look at the achievement we see the stunning figure of new job create day and low unemployment previously when we have see big economic shock people have end up unemployed with all the impact that bring for they and their family let we look at the figure publish yesterday by the department for work and pensions regard how economic inactivity rate in the uk be low than those in the usa france italy and south korea indeed they be low than the and the eu average that be real people be keep in job and if we have not have the intervention during the pandemic that we be now have to pay for it might have be very different picture it be worth see today budget not least the change in national insurance which be probably its large part in the context of the autumn statement on average tax cut for those in work in january be now follow by another reduction as someone who want low taxis and for people to keep more of the benefit of their hard work be encourage by some of the comment from the dispatch box about that issue and about the fact that those in work pay high tax rate on their income than those who get their income in other way although it will be no surprise to those on the treasury bench that will also mention tax allowance particularly the threshold for the basic rate of income tax all those in employment will benefit from national insurance rate be reduce but in future we must consider particularly those who have save for small retirement annuity on top of the state pension the effect of the triple lock have see the state pension rise to protect people against some of the impact we have see with thing such as price rise so how will that be consider go forward it would be remiss of not to mention couple of thing that be fairly pleased to see the first of which be the rise in the vat threshold we see the impact of that clearly in torbay in the guesthouse that close when it approach the threshold or the restaurant that put online what day it will open base on its estimate of when it will hit the threshold through the trading year have that threshold raise mean instant growth for the hospitality sector in the bay it be welcome to hear the tax relief on perform art and theatre be make permanent notice that the ambassador theatre group which own one of the large theatre in torbay the princess welcome that measure the alcohol duty freeze be also welcome torbay have more than its share of hospitality venue that will benefit from and welcome that change alongside that the fuel duty freeze help family with their budget the change on short term let taxation be welcome airbnb style accommodation have offer choice in the tourism and accommodation market but we certainly do not need to be offer tax break to encourage that far particularly when we be see what be family home for rent over long period be convert into holiday accommodation the chancellor be right to respond to the call that have be make to end that tax relief it be not particularly need if we be to give support to the hospitality sector it be well do via target business rate reduction or by raise the threshold which would support all small business not just small business of particular type in the sector see this budget in the context of the large support be offer to torbay regeneration more than million have be make available by the government to support scheme range from the paignton picture house revival to the torquay pavilion to the regeneration of the town centre mindful of the guidance from the chair on the length of speech will end on planning it be not about look to concrete over the green belt or other area but the need to reshape our town centre for the future in many way we need to have the type of reshaping of our town centre in the digital age that we have in the late and early for the mass motoring age when our town and city have to move away from mostly have horse and cart on the street to have motor vehicle now town centre need to reshape the process take too long even scheme with wide public support and government funding behind they can take month to get through the planning process we need to look again at that issue to stimulate growth and great prosperity overall like the direction of the budget which will make positive difference in torbay it look to lower taxis as we can and set out clear difference between ourselves who want to give people the opportunity to keep more of what they earn and to aspire for themselves and their family and labour party that be without plan it be pleasure to follow the hon member for torbay kevin foster his constituency be tourist destination much like york the hospitality and tourism sector certainly face its challenge and look forward to study the proposal from government this clearly be the last budget of this parliament and after today this government they have have year and the tories be leave the country with record debt public service on their knee and household flounder with the cost of living high rent and mortgage utility food and fuel bill up rather than repair the economy which be now in recession the chancellor have forget how his predecessor crash the economy and leave the nation pension hour away from collapse and how it will take generation to recover household be now bad off under the prime minister tax plan the government be extend the household support fund have long campaign for that but by just six month when so many family in our constituency be hang by thread as rich country britain should not need such measure but when many people have so much we see how entrenched inequality be the very safety net that should keep people safe have be slash and people be fall through it nearly million people be live in absolute destitution with million on universal credit require budgeting advance as the chancellor say we hear what the joseph rowntree foundation be say its research show that social security be simply not enough for the essential it need to be pay at rate of at least week for single person or for couple scope have say that disabled people fare even worse and need an additional week to keep themselves afloat of course the cap put in place so that people get support for only two child mean that child be leave in poverty too it should be scrap there be nothing for local government and that will be ring in the ear of councillor up and down the land the local government association say that one in five council be face bankruptcy since the city of york council have see real term cut in its settlement national government be strip local government where be the housing we need not least the social housing why be people still wait to see an nhs doctor or dentist why be people leave languish on the ward of our hospital it be because they can not get social care because people be not pay enough to do that job crime be up the justice system be dysfunctional our school be squeeze their budget and our youth service have more or less disappeared cut by in york the government have squander year the consequence of run the economy poorly be stark as turn to the world poor we think about those right now in darfur and in gaza where there be no food no medicine and no hope fail economic mean that overseas development aid have be slash and people be leave hungry and sick that be why we can not afford this government do not get wrong some people be do incredibly well they have profit from dodgy personal protective equipment contract and dodged tax altogether now that the prime minister be plan his exit from parliament and no doubt britain as well he be reform the non dom status from which he have personally benefit after year of virtually no productivity and bout of recession and economic volatility with work people hear earn taxis gamble and burn the budget have prove that the government have fail to put people above party it will be tough for labour our inheritance have be squander but we will stabilise invest in and reform the economy we must do so rebuild with fundamental labour value that determine economic competence and stability and address the scourge of inequality we will invest in future industry and job innovation entrepreneur and science and technology not least on climate mitigation with great british energy decarbonise the grid we will double onshore wind triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind bring down energy bill for the benefit of all be greatly disappointed that york and north yorkshire green new deal do not get mention it have the opportunity to create green collar job bioyorkshire will be game changer for our region and for the climate we need to ensure that we elect david skaith as labour first mayor for york and north yorkshire because he will bring that project to life as we reform we need to bring about change we need to build the house that the next generation need and this generation be desperately cry out for we need to retrofit million more home to secure green home for the future there be few thing from today announcement that welcome include the funding for the national railway museum as it expand as the world large rail museum encourage hon member to come and visit as it open its new door welcome the change to taxation on short term holiday let follow my campaign and private member bill to stop landlord flip their home but reform that would ensure the housing we need have not come forward be disappointed that the government will give grandfathering right to exist property mean that family home in york will not be return or have the opportunity of be return to family who desperately need they be interested in what the government have to say about the billion investment in the nhs follow the health and social care committee report on digital transformation look forward to scrutinise the plan as we celebrate international women week must highlight that woman be always loser under tory budgets with childcare cost rise and social care collapse the burden fall on woman we need to see change our first chancellor in the new government will be woman and encourage she to introduce gender budgeting in which every decision be stress test to ensure that it level woman with man fiscal policy political choice and administrative procedure must address gender inequality so that the economic output of woman be recognise and equality be achieve and we get well economic stability well growth and great productivity gain that be work elsewhere and want it introduce in the next parliament today there will be headline tomorrow reality will hit we will not forget these last year with the general election on the horizon and the prospect of an economic reset under labour we must move forward with labour value which we have hold for year and use our common purpose for the common good be delighted to follow the hon member for york central rachael maskell who so often speak with such passion on issue of poverty have very much enjoy my visit over the year to the national railway museum will certainly take up her invitation to visit it in its renew state in due course there be much to welcome in today budget taxis cut for work people both the employ and the self employ progress on tackle inflation which make such difference to everyday living cost and the fuel duty provision which be so important to area such as dover and deal and so different from the tax on motorist by labour london mayor the household support fund provide opportunity and support in dover and deal and across kent to so many people and welcome the extension the increase in the vat threshold for small business to be important number of local business have be in contact with about that know that it will be important to hospitality business in our area finally the focus on well healthcare outcome and the investment be both welcome however this could and should have be budget for housing that opportunity have be miss there have be misanalysis by the treasury of the fundamental importance of housing to achieve other objective to do with wellbeing health educational opportunity and the creation of saving and individual wealth over lifetime not have the housing that be need have cause increase in bed and breakfast housing increase in the number of child in temporary accommodation and huge number of who be struggle to get on the housing ladder while pay record level of rent all that cost the taxpayer money temporary accommodation cost council billion the budget increase the housing benefit budget to billion in it be throw good money after bad to continuously spend on high expenditure private rent housing instead of spend on affordable and social housing as should and could have be do in this budget that matter because england have few available home for its population than any comparable develop nation the low rate of available property per population of all oecd country the old housing stock and one of the high proportion of substandard and inadequate housing housing could and should have be priority for this budget budget for housing could have accelerate the delivery of affordable home over the next to month it could have provide much need boost to gdp of billion to billion per new home deliver the chancellor speak today about inward investment the value of house building to gdp underline what an important industry it be we could have see an opening up of pension to help first time buyer get on the housing ladder while still save for their pension over the long term that would transform home ownership opportunity for the and put home ownership back within reach of work people age or under there be so much more besides but this have be miss opportunity on housing will raise two issue in the detailed budget paper first there be the provision for stamp duty land tax exemption for social housing the paper state that that be available only for housing subject to public subsidy but large amount indeed the majority of additional affordable housing be provide through section and other planning requirement and be not the recipient of public subsidy that be the expectation of homes england and the greater london authority will the minister relook at the sdlt provision to ensure that they reflect both level playing field for all register housing provider in the sector and the reality of the housing market secondly unleash pension fund investment have be long term goal in the housing industry tremendous progress have be make in that area in recent year yet so much more can be do will the minister consider make housing part of the essential infrastructure provide for under the new unlocking of pension fund and consider how the new uk isa can be well use to help people get on the housing ladder housing and house building be fundamental to the success of our country the wellbeing of our nation and the prosperity of individual and they be therefore important to we all regret that that have not be properly reflect in the budget but hope that can meet the minister to continue these discussion and to see what can be do with the money available to build the home that our country so desperately need in his budget statement the chancellor say in recent time the uk economy have deal with financial crisis pandemic and an energy shock cause by war in europe like government members today he conveniently airbrush out of history two of the conservative government self inflect wound one of they be brexit page of the obr report state that trade with europe be down cost the economy and that the long term effect will not be know for year the other issue airbrush conveniently out of history be surprised that the chancellor forget this because it be how he get his job in the first place be the mini budget by the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss we be still pay for that through people mortgage although she have go off to pasture new surround by an audience of conspiracy theorist and right wing extremist the core of what she argue be still on display it be about small state and society in which the government will not invest in our public service we have have year of that in the north east real term median wage be below what they be in in my constituency of child live in relative poverty it be absolutely disgraceful and make angry that in the sixth most prosperous country in the world life expectancy in county durham have be go down in the last year while suicide rate be at record high in the north east that have not happen by accident the government make great pledge to have more police officer on the beat but we have few than in even with the recent increase and extra expense as for the joke of level up which be the equivalent of pork barrel politic at its bad it be not join up across the country but mainly focus on the distribution of capital sum to place where the party in power can get political capital out of it we have have one successful bid in county durham which happen to be in bishop auckland it have get we half bypass today the chancellor announce that there will be new million devolution deal for the north east in the last year durham county council alone have have to cut million from its budget every single council in the north east have lose upwards of of its budget so the money will not replace what have be lose we see from today budget and the red book that there be stagnation or even cut in every single non mainline department for example the budget for defence both capital and revenue go down next year in education the budget flatline the increase that the chancellor announce today be basically cut to our public service that be not an accident it be fact of life and it be because the chancellor and the prime minister be so scared of the right wing faction of their party it be about squeeze the state and make sure that the conservatives give away tax cut even though they have create their own problem through their wasteful economic mismanagement over the last year it will lead to dire cut feel strongly about local government because it be quite clear that council will fall over the government say that council be fall over because they be be wasteful and because some of they have do some very dodgy thing in property even though they be encourage to by the government during their time in power people ask why of durham county council budget be now spend on look after child and old people care it be because austerity result in cut in child service and the closure of sure start centre it do not take genius to work out that if we take away support for family we get more child come into the care system that put huge pressure on budget at the same time the government be offload their responsibility on to local council tax payer let finish by raise two issue that feel very strongly about the budget be about kick the can down the road and frankly the government be disgrace many people will know that have be involve in the campaign to get justice for sub postmaster for many year give credit to the under secretary of state for business and trade the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake who have be very good minister and have try to get the compensation out there however page of the obr report show that the budget put no extra money into the new scheme agree with my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson it be scandalous that no money have be allocate for the contaminated blood victim that be cynical and it be about kick this issue into the general election and hop that somebody else will deal with it the government have moral duty to both group of people and need to put money aside for they this budget be miss opportunity and it be more of the same people in this country need to wake up and recognise that we can not have well deliver local service and well structured supportive community under this government until we get an election and people wake up to the fact we will have more of what we have have over the last year the only way thing will change be under labour government this budget be overshadow by the news that the chancellor have do fairly rare thing for politician put his hand in his own pocket be this for youth club in hounslow or perhaps new high tech hospital scanner no it be for his own party association meanwhile my constituent have to live with yet another budget from yet another tired conservative government after year of their government our economy be in recession living standard be fall public service be in crisis and our country be desperate for change we have have fiscal statement since that promise high wage high skill and high growth yet they have deliver none of these today we have have another statement promise dollop of jam next year at the early my constituent like all our constituent be see their bill rise their weekly shop get more expensive their rent and mortgage skyrocket and their debt pile up so what do this budget offer they the obr figure show that under sunak tax plan work people be on average year bad off the government have give for every take away from our constituent this include the obr revise estimate of the impact of tax threshold freeze that raise billion over the forecast period and create million more taxpayer this budget do nothing to tackle the housing crisis as many member have say this be the big crisis face my constituent family locally can not afford to rent let alone buy key worker be be price out of the area and home ownership be but distant dream hundred of child in my constituency be want to say living but frankly they be exist in insecure often dangerous temporary accommodation which be cost hounslow council and the benefit budget million of pound each year that be money that could be spend on build new home it be no wonder that more and more lifelong conservative have meet in recent month whether in chiswick or in by election campaign in bedfordshire and kingswood have tell that they be no long go to vote conservative this be probably why be see so many glum face on the conservative benches while the chancellor be speak and that have be follow today by many of his party criticise his statement in their contribution include the hon member for dover mrs elphicke who have just speak talk about divided party this budget fail to deliver not only for work family and people seek accommodation but for business think of the business have meet across hounslow pub struggle with soar energy cost corner shop face crime spree and manufacturer and exporter face barrier to trade with europe this budget offer they nothing nothing on business rate on improve trade or on skill my constituent taxpayer and user of public service as they be assume that the treasury understand basic economic concept include the concept that high taxis for they mean more money for the treasury and public service today however the chancellor joke about come late to discover his inner laffer curve which mean that raise some taxis sometimes result in less tax revenue be this why he be cancel the alcohol duty rise due next year as he have be tell that he have lose couple of billion in tax revenue since last year rise that be couple of billion that our public service desperately need this be basic stuff it be basic economic that be even cover in the gcse economic syllabus my constituent from chiswick to hounslow deserve well than this budget this grow economic mess be what happen when government be obsess with headline with the short term win and with focus on the politic rather than on the long term investment that our economy need it be no wonder that we be trap in recession trap with low growth trap with decimated public service and trap with weak economy the tax burden on our constituent be high the cost of the weekly shop be high rent mortgage and energy cost be high most people be bad off after year of conservative rule it be clear that my constituent and people across the country deserve well it be time for change order that the debate be now bell debate to be resume tomorrow business without debate estimates liaison committee recommendation motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that this house agree with the report of the liaison committee of march that day not later than march be allot for the consideration of the following estimate for the financial year department for education insofar as it relate to special educational need and disability provision and home office insofar as it relate to asylum and bell question agree to dementia care in hospital motion make and question propose that this house do now bell my constituent lisa rutter be the founder of the charity dementia club uk which host event in barnet for people with dementia and their family to provide support advice and much need time out of the house to socialise with other people who be cop with similar life experience this work give lisa great insight into dementia care and the pressure on unpaid carer and she ask to meet group of carer over zoom to hear about their relative traumatic experience when admit to hospital find the meeting deeply disturbing which be why apply for this debate in the time available can only include brief point about each case can not hope to convey the emotional impact of the story as tell by the carer themselves and can not hope to get across their real distress and anger that their love one have be let down but hope to give the house an indication of the seriousness of the problem will start with lisa own story her mother tasoulla gavriel be admit to barnet hospital with covid in november sadly she die shortly afterwards tasoulla be lovely lady and meet she on number of occasion she be assess by the hospital to be an eight on the rockwood scale mean that she be view as severely frail and approach the end of her life lisa believe that this diagnosis be entirely wrong her mother be sit up and alert when admit and she do not have serious comorbiditie apart from advanced dementia which mean she need help with eating when lisa be tell by the hospital that her mother need an oxygen mask she ask for mrs gavriel to be put in hand mitten to prevent she from pull off the mask and harm her treatment the hospital refuse on the basis that this do not accord with hospital policy because it amount to deprivation of liberty the hospital decide that it be neither proportionate nor in mrs gavriel good interest for she to be give mitten that be despite mitten be use when mrs gavriel have be admit the previous year for hip operation lisa sincerely believe that mitten could have save her mother life another deeply distressing aspect of this case be that covid visitor restriction mean that lisa have only very limited time with her mother in hospital raise this in parliament at the time urge visitor restriction to be ease for patient with dementia very much welcome the subsequent introduction of great flexibility for people to spend time with their love one in hospital we must never again return to restriction of the sort we see during the pandemic some of the group speak to do not want to be name so will simply refer to they as carer to unlike the other carer be not constituent and his experience do not relate to my local barnet hospital but do not want to leave he out he emphasise how crucial it be that people with dementia continue to move and walk if they be to stave off further loss of cognition but he tell that staff at the hospital to which his wife be admit refuse to help she to walk even more worrying he have to intervene twice to prevent nurse from give she the wrong dose of medication have he not spot the mistake potentially lethal dose could have be administer congratulate the right hon lady on secure this significant debate as dementia be go to affect so many people life in the come decade as more and more people be of retirement age in devon the dementia specialist jonathan hanbury have suggest that we should place more funding and focus on community hospital community treatment and community service so that people can keep their brain agile far upstream he suggest that the nhs focus on funding for acute hospital service and expensive drug miss the value of prevention do the right hon lady agree those be very valid point it be important to keep people out of hospital for as often as possible but that be particularly the case with dementia patient give the dislocation and insecurity that come with move they to different environment measure to keep people healthy for long and to deliver care via the primary care system rather than in acute hospital be an important way to address some of the problem be outline commend the right hon lady for raise this issue over the past couple of year have deal with number of incident similar to the one she refer to do she agree that for those with dementia and alzheimer the emotional upheaval of be take from safe place where they feel comfortable can often lead to incredible distress which can in turn result in aggressive behaviour know of one young nurse who have her arm break in two place it be not the patient fault as he be simply beside himself and could not let go of she do the right hon lady agree that there must be enough staff in place to ensure that one young nurse should not be leave scream in pain with no one there to help she do she also agree that that patient deserve compassion and understanding for their outburst the hon gentleman make an important point one problem that emerge from some of the case will talk about tonight be that disruptive behaviour by patient with dementia include shout can often be just an attempt to communicate it be vital that staff understand that of course agree that it be essential that we have sufficient number of staff to ensure that they can give appropriate attention to patient with dementia in these circumstance the father of carer die month after be admit to barnet hospital this constituent report that food and drink be often just leave in tray with little apparent effort make by staff to feed her father he be leave all day in chair or in bed with no attempt make by the staff to encourage he to walk he be not support while in the toilet and when that lead to distressing and undignified consequence include the soiling of his clothe and hand he be not wash until the following day carer tell that her husband condition deteriorate significantly during stay in barnet hospital apparently the nurse complain and say that he scream all night my constituent explain to they that that mean he want to get up to go to the loo but be prevent from do so by the side bar on the bed he be simply call out for help she often find food leave untouched yet no one seem to note that her father have stop eat the catering staff just take the uneaten meal away his medication be also stop without his family be tell which lead to worsening of his symptom and his anxiety carer tell about her partner who have early onset lewy body dementia and be admit to barnet hospital in april after fall apparently until that point he be walk climb stair and cop fairly well at home albeit that he be little wobbly on his foot but the last time he ever walk be when he arrive at the barnet accident and emergency department my constituent be initially restrict in visit hour and have to fight to be allow to stay in the hospital outside those time she feel that the staff especially some of the agency worker do not understand her partner care need she be give the number for the specialist dementia nurse cover the hospital trust but the phone be never pick up no matter how often she ring during his stay in the hospital her partner deteriorate far more quickly than he have before he be keep in bed constantly and lose the ability to walk he be only at one point after undergo an mri scan he be leave distressed and confuse in cold hospital corridor wear hospital gown damp with urine after radiographer have remove incontinence conveen equipment after he get out of barnet hospital he say he would never ever go back no matter the circumstance carer tell about her father who be admit to barnet hospital with pneumonia in november when an ambulance be send to pick he up he be able to walk downstairs without assistance and climb into the back throughout his stay it be extremely difficult for my constituent to get to speak to any doctor or nurse about his care motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now bell carer become increasingly desperate to take her father home as his condition deteriorate he have always be meticulous about his personal hygiene an old style gentleman who always dress in shirt and tie no matter what the occasion after time in barnet hospital he be unshaven and unkempt and he stop eat it apparently take six month for he to return to something like his old self but his appetite never return to what it have be he have since pass away theme that emerge again and again in my discussion with this carer group include repeat difficulty in carer get to speak to nurse or doctor about the care need and health of love one failure by staff to understand the care need of people with dementia failure to ensure patient eat and drank and failure to keep patient mobile and walk from what hear from my constituent it be clear that allow extensive visitor access be crucial for patient with dementia so relative can help communicate with staff and assist with feeding and care as say we must never again tolerate the type of restriction that be in place during covid communication by doctor and nurse to relative must be improve as well the group ask that the nhs develop much large volunteer programme train many more people to support dementia patient with eat and walk if they do not have family to help they in addition volunteer should be train to advocate for dementia patient if they do not have relative who be able to do that these case show need for more in depth and effective training programme for nhs staff on how to look after patient with dementia commend the training programme on understand dementia that barnet council have commission my constituent lisa rutter to carry out and urge local nhs service to consider take part in that programme we need to do as much as we possibly can to keep people healthy for long and ensure that when they get ill there be an option for treatment in the community to keep as many people out of hospital as possible want to emphasise that appreciate the effort be make by frontline nhs staff to care for and support people with dementia appreciate that although there have be some serious failing in the case have refer to thousand of people spend time in barnet hospital every year and receive the good quality care thank all the nhs worker who make that happen accept that there be currently great pressure on staff as healthcare need continue to expand exponentially and the nhs undertake the massive task of catch up after covid when raise these case with barnet hospital it emphasise its commitment to ensure that patient with dementia and their carer have the good experience possible staff tell they have set up dementia service in manage by dementia clinical nurse specialist in the hospital apparently treat patient train member of staff and receive some very positive feedback from patient and carer in it be one of the first nhs trust to sign up to john campaign to ensure carer can visit patient with dementia at any time outside visit hour by prior arrangement with the ward manager the trust provide dementia training above the expectation set by nhs england include mandatory tier dementia awareness training on induction specialist dementia training be also provide for all volunteer to support patient during meal time red tray system be in place patient who need additional time encouragement or assistance be identify and provide with red tray in it launch keep move campaign which focus on keep patient as active as possible while they be in hospital there be telephone line for carer and love one to contact dementia clinical nurse specialist although recognise the value of these measure and welcome all of they be afraid that the case have outline indicate that they be simply not always deliver the intend result they be not enough believe that the failure in these case demonstrate that more must be do to ensure that dementia patient receive the good care possible and that they receive dignified treatment at all time therefore hope that the management at barnet hospital will reflect carefully on the matter raise by my constituent which have set out this evening care and support for people with dementia be one of the most important challenge of our generation this be task that be likely only to grow in scale when in year to come around one in three people bear today be expect to develop dementia we must ensure that every one of those people have access to high quality health and social care that mean continue to increase resource for the national health service so that staff can give each patient the time and attention that they need in this financial year the nhs resource budget be due to be billion it be due to reach billion in welcome the announcement this afternoon by the chancellor of furth billion the total be far high than ever before mean that the nhs have more hospital doctor and nurse than ever before and be deliver more appointment test treatment and operation than ever before but if we be to relieve pressure on the nhs and tackle waiting list and ensure that every patient get the good care we need to tackle delay in discharge people back into care setting in the community to do that it be essential that we fund local government to play its part welcome substantial increase in funding for social care over recent year but the cost of social care continue to place real strain on council budget if we be to have the care home place that we desperately need care provider also need to be pay rate by council sufficient to provide the level of care need by people with dementia we also need long term strategy for the social care workforce to ensure that we train and recruit the people that we need to carry out these vital role and that we pay they appropriately give the importance of the job that they do now that the government science and research budget be one of the big in the world we must give high priority to dementia research to tackle this massive epidemic lecanemab and donanemab represent an incredible breakthrough finally there be glimmer of hope these be the first ever drug show to address the disease itself rather than just its symptom we must ensure that the nhs be ready to start deliver these treatment once final approval be give that will require step change in testing capacity so that we identify people who can benefit from the drug in time for they to have an effect as society we must do everything we can to support unpaid carer include with respite care accord to the alzheimer society around million people in england provide some form of care and support for friend or relative with dementia the overall value of those service provide amount probably to billion conclude this evening by pay tribute to every carer who look after love one with dementia include the six brave individual who speak to about their experience and prompt this debate today they be all hero to whom this country owe huge debt of gratitude they deserve our deep thank and our support sincerely thank my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers for secure this adjournment debate and for her powerful speech she really bring the subject to life through the example from her constituency of people experience in hospital they be very difficult story to hear and be very sorry to hear of time when it sound like the care for people love one have fall short my right hon friend make some powerful point that want to address start with the fact that as she say there be many thousand of people live with dementia and the number be only expect to increase indeed there will be more than million by many people with dementia will also be live with other health condition at the moment it be estimate that around quarter of the bed in hospital be be use by patient with dementia so ensure that people receive the right care when they be in hospital with dementia be really important as be do our utmost to avoid unnecessary admission and ensure that people be discharge from hospital on timely basis it be really worth emphasise the point that my right hon friend make about dignity and the fact that every single person count at whatever stage of their life there be challenge to ensure that people live with dementia have that dignity particularly when they be in hospital too pay tribute to the many unpaid carer who be look after their love one with dementia know what huge burden and challenge that can be however much someone love somebody there be huge demand on they when they be care for somebody with dementia it can be very difficult very distressing and absolutely relentless however much they love they pay tribute to all carer who be do that my right hon friend speak first about lisa rutter who very sadly lose her mother who be live with dementia during the pandemic in hospital if hear my right hon friend correctly thank lisa rutter for the work that she be do as the founder of dementia club uk it be fabulous to be support other people to look after love one with dementia or indeed those with dementia themselves my right hon friend talk about the time lisa mother spend in hospital and how for instance lisa know what her mother need but feel that she be not listen to and that it may have contribute to her mother death my right hon friend also talk about the visit restriction during the pandemic will talk about those in moment my right hon friend talk about another constituent whose wife be in hospital she rightly talk about the importance of mobilise somebody with dementia and how her constituent wife be nearly give the wrong medication which could have be fatal she speak about the importance of his intervention she also speak about constituent who be carer for their father and the importance of mobilisation and some of the communication challenge for somebody with dementia my right hon friend talk about one person who have be scream all night as describe by the staff actually the family member who know they understand that they be call for help as they need to go to the toilet that bring to life how difficult it can be when somebody have dementia and be not necessarily able to articulate their need and what they want those who know they well will often know what they be try to say or communicate but that can be difficult in hospital when they may be be look after by staff who simply do not know they well enough to know what they mean my right hon friend talk about food be leave uneaten if somebody be not eat in hospital clearly they be likely to lose weight and their condition may deteriorate she also talk about medication be stop and she talk particularly about somebody whose partner have early onset dementia and have be cop fairly well at home he walk into and that be very sadly the last time he walk that emphasise the challenge of keep people move and maintain their ability to be mobile during hospital stay she also describe the fight to visit outside visit hour very much hear my right hon friend ask on visitor access volunteer be train in dementia care as well as staff training and avoid discharge delay among other thing will pick up on some of those first on the challenge of care for people with dementia when in hospital many hospital have work hard to do well for patient with dementia for example create dementia friendly environment by change the colour and lie out ensure that staff be train in dementia and have dementia lead and dementia lead nurse as well as have training for volunteer standard training in care for people with dementia be available through nhs england for staff and volunteer clearly my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet describe example where care fall short have no doubt that across the nhs with the work already take place we can go far will raise the point that she make about secondary care with my colleague the minister for health and secondary care so that we can work together on ensure that care be right in hospital he also have oversight of workforce and we should focus on whether the training that know be available be be take up by enough staff consider the number of people in hospital with dementia on visit my right hon friend speak about subject that be close to my heart have be involve in some of the decision about social care visit restriction during the pandemic and know how hard those decision be weigh up the infection control concern and ensure people could spend time with love one we have be put in place change to care quality commission regulation to make visit fundamental right fundamental part of care and fundamental standard of care to ensure well access for love one to their family member in care home and in hospital know in particular how important that be for people with dementia among other the cqc be consult on the implementation of the regulatory change which will be live report march vol correction believe we have take significant step to address concern express about visit another thing my right hon friend speak about be fast discharge be very alert to the risk of patient deconditione in hospital particularly patient with dementia that be why over the past year or so we have work hard with the nhs to get well at identify patient at great risk of deconditione in particular those with dementia on their admission to hospital we have do early discharge planning and have be get care transfer hub establish all across the country which will do the work on more complex discharge often someone with dementia may need more access to social care we may need to increase the access to availability and supply of social care so that it be there for those who will need it when they leave hospital we have make some real progress on that over the past year will the minister give way have very little time so be afraid will not give way my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet talk about the social care workforce another subject close to my heart we have strategy for the care workforce we be build care as career in particular to boost recruitment and retention among our home grow workforce we recently publish the first ever national career structure for care worker and we be launch new national qualification to boost the supply of care worker avoid admission be another priority for clearly some people should be absolutely must be in hospital for the treatment they need but we know that patient with dementia in particular can deteriorate in hospital so we be do more work with the national health service and social care to avoid admission when it be not truly necessary by put in place alternative or at the other end support early discharge through the roll out of the hospital at home initiative or virtual ward under which we commit to at least hospital at home bed or equivalent as part of emergency care recovery plan the nhs have over deliver on that so we now have more than hospital at home bed which help people who would otherwise be in hospital receive acute care they receive that care and be able to recuperate at home avoid the risk of long hospital stay and deconditione my right hon friend talk about dementia research and the new treatment come onstream the government have commit to double our investment in dementia research during this parliament and we be on track to do that with our dementia mission we be also work very closely with nhs england to be ready for the breakthrough treatment lecanemab and donanemab come onstream should be clear that we know very well have receive clinical advice on this that those treatment have quite significant side effect so they will not be suitable for everybody and put note of caution there we be wait to hear whether they be approve by the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency and the national institute for health and care excellence in the event of approval nhs england be take step to be ready to put in place the level of diagnosis require to be able to support those treatment that go hand in hand with the work that we be do with nhs england to improve the diagnosis rate for dementia we have target dementia diagnosis rate of that drop during the pandemic because dementia service and assessment have to be close but it have be gradually build up and expect nhs england to get back up to that level during the course of this year that be really important because have diagnosis help people the individual with dementia and their carer for example to access the support and back up that they should be receive be conscious of the clock ticking so have try cover some of the territory that my right hon friend set out in her speech which think be very powerful in raise these significant issue for those with dementia receive care in hospital their carer and love one completely agree about the importance of dignified treatment and treat those with dementia with dignity at all time know that that can be particularly challenge in hospital but we have to ensure that that be the case we will ensure that we get all the necessary care in place outside hospital which avoid unnecessary admission support people to be discharge from hospital quick get ready for the arrival of new dementia treatment and raise awareness about the significant proportion of dementia case that can be prevent or at least delay by look after our health in fact the risk factor for dementia be similar to those for heart disease and other thing and there be relatively low awareness of that we will see more people with dementia in the year ahead but we can do more to raise awareness of how people can maintain their health and stave it off will the minister give way be just come to close thank my right hon friend for secure the debate will continue my work to pursue the topic that we have discuss this evening question put and agree to house adjourn
