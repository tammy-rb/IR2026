they more easily challengeable if leaseholder consider they to be unreasonable congratulate the government on the bold action they be take to end the feudal leasehold system for good which will ensure that future flat owner will never again be treat as second class homeowner but as the minister be well aware there be million of exist leaseholder include thousand in my constituency of hendon will he

have understand the hon gentleman correctly he point to how variety of arrangement can be put in place under freehold estate we need to capture that variety across the country that be one of the challenge in look at what measure we might bring forward to reduce the prevalence of such arrangement and we certainly intend to do that call the shadow minister the last government pass the leasehold and freehold reform act support by the then opposition labour say in the king speech that it would go far with reform and quickly then the minister say that would take the whole of this parliament now the secondary legislation need as well as the consultation pende mean that leaseholder be unlikely to see any reform quickly last week the government say that primary legislation may now be need without implement the law already pass be that not just another example of the government promise one thing but now flail around delay and break key promise they make while leaseholder across the country suffer must say that the shadow minister be develop bit of habit here he seem to have conflate number of separate issue the government have very clear commitment to end the feudal leasehold system within this parliament that require wide set of reform than switch on the power that be already on the statute book via the act though we be go to do that and be do so at pace if he care to

elect to this place on the back of pledge to revitalise the town in my constituency with the high street in st austell in sorry state be delighted to have be able to take the first step towards revitalise it by end the impasse at the site of the now derelict general wolfe pub and move my constituency office back into town at the other end of the street however the fact remain that the high street be on its knee and many resident feel that our once great town could do much well what step be the minister take to ensure that significant resource be available beyond just the plan for neighbourhood to revitalise town in constituency like mine can say to my hon friend constituent that he be make good on that election commitment because we have have this conversation on multiple occasion like all future funding the government will set out their long term vision for local growth at the multi year spending review but in this year the recently communicate uk share prosperity fund announcement include more than million for cornwall and the isles of scilly mixture of revenue and capital funding to ensure that place can get go and kick start economic growth locally bring town such as his into play in my sherwood forest constituency high street be the beat heart of town such as ollerton and hucknall ollerton be set to receive record funding from this labour government and thank the minister for that however hucknall be badly let down by the previous government with false promise of funding that quite simply do not exist will he meet to discuss how this labour government can support the future of hucknall enable it to be the glorious high street it once be fully share my hon friend anger about the unfunded commitment to hucknall from the previous government know how disappointing that have be locally be pleased we have be able to reprioritise some funding within extremely tight budget to give the support that she talk about as she know live only two tram stop from hucknall and of course would be keen to pop on the tram and see she and if we meet in the plough would be doubly keen either way will be make sure get to see she in meet parent of child with severe disability in my constituency lack of suitable toilet and change facility make it almost impossible for those family to enjoy day out and have be inspire to campaign for more change place toilet ever since recently open change place toilet just off leyburn high street which will improve accessibility across wensleydale will the minister join in thank everyone involve and commit to support more change place toilet across the country so that family can have both the opportunity and the dignity that they deserve share the right hon gentleman enthusiasm for change place toilet which have their root in nottingham frankly people will not be able to access the amenity on their high street if they do not feel they can leave their home without those facility share his enthusiasm and commend he and his community he sell himself slightly short however because recall that when he be minister in this department he change the rule and building regulation to make it easy to develop such toilet and as chancellor he make funding available for more as well would like to take this opportunity to recognise that and to praise he and the community of wensleydale house in multiple occupation throughout broxbourne on our high street in particular be cause my constituent lot of issue what will the minister do to review the power that my local council of east herts and broxbourne have to stop hmo where we do not want they this be really important question the future mix of our high street will undoubtably include yes traditional retail but also leisure and accommodation that footfall can be good thing but if this be not well planned or well organise and if community be not bring along it will not succeed be conscious that we have the planning and infrastructure bill proceeding ahead of we today and be sure the hon gentleman will find an opportunity to make that case to the minister for housing and planning in surrey heath business will contribute more than million in business rate to surrey borough council but because of central government tariffing only of those business rate will be retain locally there be reasonable expectation that locally raise taxis should remain local so with local government reorganisation on its way could the secretary of state and the front bench team reassure surrey heath business that they might have chance of retain more of those business rate that should be invest back into our high street the hon gentleman will be aware of the change we have make to ensure that there be discount on business rate for certain business this year with further commitment to come at the budget he make the right point of course can not announce that outside the budget but we will consider those point carefully call the shadow minister our high street and small business have be hammer by this government with big increase in the cost of business rate and national insurance contribution can the minister tell the house what measure he and the team have put forward to the chancellor of the exchequer to help our small business and high street in the spending review the hon gentleman offer two opportunity there first we talk about challenge on the high street but remind the house of the more than decade of starve demand because the economic policy of the conservatives and all the impact that have follow the stag do on the opposition front bench be make their rattle as usual but they be all present during that disastrous fiscal event that lead to the increase cost that we be still cop with now the second temptation the hon gentleman give be the opportunity to resign by leak detail of the spending review here first sadly will give no succour there every high street need chorley market that be the answer new homes minimum epc rating what step she be take to ensure that new home meet the minimum standard of epc rating the december uplift to energy efficiency standard mean that most new build home already achieve epc rating of or as recently announce the government intend to introduce future standard in the autumn that will set more ambitious energy efficiency and carbon emission requirement for new home to ensure that they be net zero ready as well as energy water be an important utility in ely and east cambridgeshire we suffer drought and flood what be the minister do to encourage new build to have proper rainwater harvesting and dual piping so that we can use rainwater to flush our toilet and for other non drink water use we be look at how we might make household water use more efficient as well as range of other intervention in my hon friend part of the country to ensure that we make the good use of water and that the necessary infrastructure be put in place to accommodate housing growth in hartlepool exist home have an energy performance certificate rating of or below that mean too many home be too cold and have bill that be too high what can the minister do to accelerate the improvement of those home to ensure warm home for hartlepool constituent my hon friend tempt into the responsibility of another department but will get the relevant minister from the department for energy security and net zero to write to he to set out what measure be be put in place as part of the warm home plan in just of home have an epc rating or above so those home be too cold and have bill that be too high it be by when we leave power will the minister share with the house the ambition and give we number for the percentage of home that we should expect to have that basic epc rating by the end of this term which hope will be the only one the minister have so he should make difference while he can laughter that bit harsh the right hon gentleman be certainly not charitable as make clear recognise the december uplift in energy efficiency standard mean that most new build that come through achieve an epc rating of or off the top of my head though stand to be correct think about of new home meet those standard but as say we have announce that we want to introduce future standard this autumn which will drive even more ambitious energy efficiency and carbon emission requirement for new home have long campaign on the need for much tough regulation for solar panel on new home be delighted to hear the government announce last friday that we will bring forward requirement to do exactly that that will not just boost epc rating but save new homeowner thousand of pound in bill all while reduce energy usage how can we ensure that we move at speed so that as many of the new home we build over the course of this parliament as possible will benefit from our ambition here my hon friend have be champion of ensure that we get more solar panel on to new build home and other type of building as say in answer to previous question we want to move at pace to put future standard in place we be look at this autumn and that will ensure more of the new home come forward meet those more ambitious standard it will mean as he be aware that the vast majority of new build home have solar panel on they as standard regeneration funding scotland what assessment she have make of the potential impact of uk government regeneration funding on town in scotland the government define mission be deliver economic growth and drive up living standard that be why we be invest up to million across scottish town over year to support regeneration tackle inequality and unleash their full potential that will empower local community improve public service and create new opportunity that is of course alongside the share prosperity fund which be invest million in fife this year many time have raise with the minister as well as with business and treasury ministers the need for regeneration funding for kirkcaldy high street the brilliant people of our town deserve modern town centre that make the most of our incredible seafront and all it have to offer ahead of the spending review this week can the minister assure that my message have be hear will he also join in congratulate davy russell labour new msp and strong campaigner for his high street the people of hamilton larkhall and stonehouse have choose well can assure the hon lady her constituent and the house that do not think week have go by without she push on kirkcaldy town centre she know that can not run ahead of any multi year spending review that may be upon we soon but the point she make and always make to be good one of course associate myself with her comment about davy rise order will just say that supplementary question should aim to relate to the original question this be about funding in scotland so be sure that the hon gentleman question will be purely about that the minister be right to point out the need for regeneration for town in scotland last week the government agree in this chamber to fund for england and wales that leave only one part of the united kingdom leave out northern ireland laughter what will be do to ensure that northern ireland get the same as the other three administration just answer the scotland bit please minister the hon gentleman know that talk with my counterpart in all the devolved government include scotland and northern ireland and will continue to do so the shared prosperity fund be sign of our commitment in that direction we will be sure see future plan shortly construction sector specialist apprentices whether her department be take step with independent training college to train construction sector specialist apprentice to support house building target the government recognise the need to expand and upskill the construction workforce to meet our ambitious plan for change milestone of deliver million safe and decent home in this parliament we be work closely with industry to provide high quality house building training opportunity and we welcome the million industry investment late last year in pioneer new home building skill hub which will create up to more construction apprenticeship per year the construction skill village in scarborough be an innovative real world training environment for the specialist trade that we desperately need to build home do the minister acknowledge the importance of independent training provider in our plan to build million new home and will he meet to discuss how we can ensure that itp which deliver the specialist skill that the construction industry be ask for be include in our plan to train new construction worker the government be invest significant amount of money to train more construction worker we appreciate fully the importance of independent training provider in train the workforce need to deliver more home across england suggest that my hon friend and find time to meet baroness smith from the department for education to discuss matter relate to itp include the csv in my hon friend constituency welcome the minister commitment to support skill training in the construction sector do he agree that skill training need to be particularly focus on the sustainable skill and will he join in congratulate the low carbon technology training centre in my constituency as well as the new university in hereford its first cohort of engineer graduate just last month do he welcome such initiative and will the government put more funding into support the construction and engineering skill that our building sector will need hope that the hon lady recognise that we be put significant amount of investment into construction skill in the spring statement the government announce million investment that will recruit an additional construction worker by be more than happy to recognise the contribution make by initiative of the sort that she mention in her constituency we absolutely need skill across the build environment to meet our target social housing supply if she will take step through the spending review to increase social housing supply what step she be take to build more social and affordable home in our first eight month in office we have announce million in new funding for the affordable home programme and billion as down payment on future investment the previous government hand back precious cash for social and affordable home this government will get those home build the chancellor will set out detail of new investment at the spending review very much welcome the secretary of state commitment to social and affordable housing know that she will be concern by the new analysis by the national housing federation which find that local authority in england with the most severe shortage of social housing now have waiting list exceed year for family sized social home with nearly people on the waiting list in salford alone will she outline what support she will give local authority and the social housing sector to deliver desperately need social home my hon friend be absolutely right we have housing crisis in this country and it be feel particularly acutely by those who need social and council housing that be why we have be absolutely clear that we want to deliver the big increase to social and affordable housing in generation we have already outline number of measure include allow council to retain of right to buy receipt and make long term funding settlement for rent we have set out the investment that we have put into the sector but we will say more at the spending review have access to safe and secure home be basic human need but the tories absolutely ignore this when they cut government funding by billion in just five year and derby have suffer the consequence last year waiting list for social housing in our city reach record high what step be the secretary of state take to lift people stick on these waiting list out of limbo and into good social housing my hon friend be great champion for derby and many member across this house can understand the acute pressure he mention the fact be we have not be build enough home and we certainly have not be build enough social home therefore we have already set out some step as mention briefly early around the right to buy receipt and we be consult on new long term rent settlement to give provider confidence to build and we will be invest billion of pound into social housing can not pre empt the spending review this week but the chancellor will set out more then when developer pledge to build minimum of affordable housing and obtain outline planning permission on the basis of that pledge and then less than month later seek to reduce the to be that acceptable be not go to stray into individual case but what will say be that since gain office this government have confirm the change to the national planning policy framework in particular around section to ensure that when developer seek planning permission and pledge that they be go to do something they be keep to those pledge my constituency be see approximately new home be build across the basildon and thurrock area basildon hospital be consistently run at capacity and school visit today which be very proud to see in such good state have roughly pupil application for available space each year along with housing my constituent be deeply concerned about the level of infrastructure be develop and the state of the exist infrastructure what reassurance can minister give they about those concern come back to the point that we do need housing include social and council housing we have be clear in the change that we have be make include in the planning and infrastructure bill to ensure that that infrastructure be there because that be one of the barrier lead to people reject some proposal because the transport connectivity and the facility be not available therefore this government be commit to ensure we get the right type of development that support local need and also importantly have the infrastructure alongside it call the shadow minister the deputy prime minister have repeatedly stick to her commitment that million home include social home will be build over the lifetime of this parliament despite everybody know that she will not achieve it and today the late people to say she will not are savills who have forecast that the true number she will build over this parliament be just and that mean few social home too now that she have emerge from the dark room of the treasury to capitulate to the chancellor will the deputy prime minister confirm that more social home and million new home will be build by the end of this parliament yes or no the opposition can not have it both way one way they be say we be fail to build the home and the other way they be say we be concrete over the green belt we say that planning reform alone will not deliver our ambition which be why we have commit to deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in generation and say to the hon member as have say to many people in my life underestimate at your peril call the liberal democrats spokesperson jess in my constituency have all her possession and bag put on the pavement outside the hotel and be lock out of her bedroom with her baby by hotel management shock behaviour on their part with billion be spend by local authority on temporary accommodation would it not be well to have national target for the number of social home that be go to be build what step will the government be take to set such target be disgusted to hear about what happen to that young person and her baby that be absolutely terrible the number of people particularly child who be in temporary accommodation at the moment be shocking which be why this government be commit to the big wave of social and affordable housing in generation we have not put particular number on that not least because we do not have the spending review result they be come later this week but we be clear that we want that number to ramp up and we need that proportion to meet the target of million new home so ask the hon member to wait just little bit long local authority funding what progress her department have make on provide adequate funding for local authority as part of the fair funding review what step her department be take to help ensure that council be financially stable what step her department be take to help ensure that council be financially stable what step her department be take to ensure that council in area with high level of deprivation receive adequate funding the government have deliver settlement that begin to fix the foundation and make available over billion in in an improved approach will direct funding where it be need most and provide certainty through the first multi year settlement in over decade leicestershire alongside other authority have be campaign for fair funding in recent year follow year of poor funding settlement by the last government mean cut to vital service lack of fair funding also mean that school in north west leicestershire have some of the low level of funding per student in the country how will the minister approach fair funding settlement that consider the unique challenge face by rural community thank my hon friend for her work in champion those issue we be fundamentally reform how we assess council relative need and resource to ensure that funding be distribute to where it be need most that include account for council ability to raise resource locally which the previous government promise to do but ultimately fail to do in balance the number target funding in that way will enable council that have have to scale back service the most to be able to catch up and to ensure that everybody across the whole of england be able to access decent public service despite an increase in council tax of since million in exceptional financial support this year and brutal cut to service croydon council finance remain broken as an outer london borough with inner london problem croydon have historically not receive the funding it need to cover the cost for demand lead service like temporary accommodation so even if croydon debt be wipe out it would still need exceptional financial support will the minister outline how council like croydon will get the resource they need to meet the complex challenge they face and provide the frontline service that our community deserve the question that have be raise demonstrate why the fair funding review be need and why it have to take into account all the different factor that have an impact on whether council can provide good public service or not appreciate understand and accept that pressure that be previously feel in inner london be now feel in outer london and in rural area too my hon friend will know that in february we provide million in efs support for croydon council and we will continue to work with it we have meet and talk about the issue number of time and know that she understand that those be not small problem to deal with the statutory override to special educational need and disability deficit come to an end in just month without plan from the government for the end of the statutory override more than half of all local education authority face effective bankruptcy the need for resolution to the issue be now long overdue when do the minister expect to be able to give local authority the certainty they need we be lay the groundwork now ahead of the provisional settlement which will be the first multi year settlement in over decade and will deal with lot of the structural issue if it be any help the government understand and accept that it be not right or acceptable for council that have do everything that have be ask of they and provide good public service particularly for young people to find themselves at the financial cliff edge as result we have an absolute commitment to work through those issue pocket of deprivation in many rural community like my south west norfolk constituency be often mask by more affluent surrounding will the minister reassure that financial support from the government for local council in rural area reflect those concern about isolated deprivation this month we be consult on an update assessment of need that we will implement from importantly that include the index of multiple deprivation designate national statistic and it will drill down to deprivation level of between and household in each of those unit our intention be to address the issue find in the pocket of deprivation in every community include rural and coastal community where they be sometimes drown out because of the sea of affluence around they it be important that we get to deprivation wherever it exist as an outer london borough havering have be hugely disadvantage by funding formula base on outdated population figure we hear today that the mayor of london himself be concern that this labour government will level down london altogether will the minister confirm that the fair funding review will report by this summer have be tell that previously by minister and will specifically address the disparity between inner and outer london can absolutely assure the hon member that we be work through those issue and we will consult the sector on they give all the variation that we will take into account hope member accept that we have listen we know that the funding formula be out of date and that for it to stand the test it must apply wherever member represent whether in coastal community rural community inner or outer london or anywhere else in between assure the hon member that we be get on with that work shropshire council finance have be leave on the brink by year of conservative administration it be the large landlocked county in england and it be struggle with about of its budget be spend on social care when the minister do his fair funding review will he look at the difficulty and costliness of deliver service over such wide rural area and ensure that council such as shropshire which have lose its rural service delivery grant will be able to sustain themselves in the future we make available an additional billion as part of the settlement and billion of that be for social care we understand the pressure and we be direct money to address they but we know that this issue will take more than one year to fix we be on with the fair funding review the third multi year settlement in decade to begin to fix the foundation we have definitely hear call from rural community and council to take into account the additional cost for rurality and remoteness and assure the hon lady that those issue be be look at one way of ensure that new unitary authority such as those for leicestershire have adequate funding be to base that funding on robust business case give that the department be five week late in provide feedback to the local authority will the minister commit to extend the deadline to ensure that those local authority have the time that they need to build up those plan in all area there be more than adequate time to prepare final proposal council in the devolution priority programme have until september and all other the majority have until november that be more than adequate time for council to be able to marshal and get their plan together and make an assessment on that basis it have be report that the birmingham bin strike may last until december how can this government claim to support worker when they refuse to fund birmingham city council properly this dispute boil down to cash yet the government be fail birmingham bin worker resident and business the government back our steelworker will they back the bin worker with extra funding hear what the hon gentleman say on the call that we have with mps when we update they on these issue his tone be quite different we need to separate the rhetoric from the reality the reality be that for the first time we have million in the recovery grant which be about those council suffer high deprivation and historically low tax basis birmingham be the big beneficiary of that receive nearly million call the shadow minister the minister know from his time at the local government association of the impact that asylum have on the budget of local authority with the home office much vaunted increase in the grant rate for asylum claim the government be push thousand of household on to council waiting list and shunt million in cost on to council tax payer what additional funding and measure do he aim to secure to help to mitigate those cost which be affect so many of our local authority quite frankly it be bit rich for any shadow minister to critique the current system when the conservatives deliberately design it in their year in government the question be how we go about repair it one thing must absolutely be put right the disjointed system in which different government departments work in silos can not carry on one of the success of the leader council be that for the first time ever local government leader be around the table with the government include in meeting with the home office and our department to work through exactly those issue that be the change for the first time those in local government be be treat as adult topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility as the planning and infrastructure bill enter its remain stage in the commons thank my hon friend the housing minister and members across the

the light of some worry small site application on previously undeveloped green belt land in my constituency and of concern from the campaign to protect rural england will the minister undertake to monitor and assess the initial impact of the new grey belt provision and look at refine the wording to avoid salami slicing of the green belt no we be confident that the protection in place for the

plan across london child be live in temporary accommodation deny the essential of stable home which have terrible consequence for their physical and mental health and education this be scandalous inheritance from the previous conservative government when do the secretary of state believe that we will begin to see those number drop substantially we have invest almost billion in tackle

local planning process or local community take those opportunity to shape place local authority be important in that conversation know my hon friend be push his in that regard it have be estimate and report that billion worth of unspent community infrastructure levy may be available at local authority level for investment in critical infrastructure will the minister ensure that the money be invest in road and drainage so it can deliver the improvement that our resident deserve there be legitimate reason why developer contribution can be hold by local authority for example so that they can complete phase development or bring forward other site over period of time but we be aware that certain local authority hold in some case significant sum and we be give the matter some attention the shared health foundation recently publish vital report on child live in temporary accommodation which reveal the scandalous fact that all too often child live in such accommodation be not safe secure or able to thrive do the minister agree that it fall to this labour government to fix that wrong on which there have be silence for too long my hon friend be right we have inherit record level of

must start to provide the consumer protection that be already on the statute book but as have make clear we be determined to end the injustice of fleecehold entirely and will consult later this year on legislative and policy option to reduce the prevalence of private estate management arrangement broadly support unitarisation on strategic scale but be concerned about how historic debt will be treat in surrey especially those of woking and spelthorne council how will those debt be handle as our council come together and will the minister assure my constituent in virginia water and englefield green in the well run borough of runnymede that they will not foot the bill for this as part of the reorganisation that be one of the reason why the surrey arrangement be accelerate we recognise the lack of balance between the debt liability and the asset and income we also recognise that the unitarie would have to be financially viable and we be well on track to deliver that in partnership with the local council call the chair of the select committee welcome the enhanced protection for tenant in the renters rights bill but datum from the londoner show that for london tenant there be only one enforcement officer per private rent home give the new enforcement burden that the bill place on council will the minister please ensure that they have the resource to protect

transcript on this point we do commit ourselves to new burden funding as appropriate give the environmental importance and scarcity of chalk stream may urge the deputy prime minister and her team to support amendment to this afternoon legislation that would protect those stream they be vital and they need as much protection as we can give they as the hon gentleman will know chalk stream already have protection in national planning policy but be sure that we will continue this discussion on report of the planning and infrastructure bill later today will the minister meet and resident of beech

of factor have lead we to this point but we be give serious consideration to how we unblock the problem and how we get those section home allocate and people live in they chinese embassy development urgent question to ask the secretary of state for housing communities and local government what assessment she have make of the united states government national security concern regard the propose chinese embassy development at royal mint court this government be commit to the probity of the planning process at all level to ensure robust and evidence base decision making the process include role for plan ministers in decide on call in planning application and recovered appeal so hope that the house will appreciate why can not comment in any detail on specific planning application at the dispatch box that say it may be helpful to member if set out the process that these case follow the application refer to by the right hon member be consider to meet the publish call in policy set out in the october write ministerial statement so it will be determine by ministers the application be not yet with the department all decision that come before minister be subject to examination by an independent planning inspector usually through public inquiry the planning inspector then provide an evidence base recommendation and set out their full reason for that recommendation the inspector report consider the application against publish local regional and national planning policy which be likely to contain wide variety of material planning consideration in this case those be likely to include safety and national security public inquiry be hold on this case between and february at which interested party be able to put forward evidence and make representation should any further representation be make that raise material planning consideration before the decision be make they will also be take into account at all time the decision will be deal with in line with the publish propriety guidance on planning casework decision the right hon member will be aware that the home secretary and foreign secretary make joint representation to the planning inspectorate ahead of the start of the inquiry that will be take into account alongside all other relevant matter once the planning inspector report and recommendation be receive the case will be determine by planning minister who will come to decision base on material planning consideration the us government and today the dutch parliament have express concern about sensitive cable under royal mint court beijing have recent history of cut cable and confirm infrastructure hack include embed malware capable of disable all that infrastructure surprisingly the secretary of state for science innovation and technology say on television yesterday that this issue be in the planning process and could be manage will the minister correct the record the planning inquiry have conclude and no change at all can be make to the chinese planning application remind the minister that the application contain nothing about cable indeed the chinese have reject only two request by the inquiry request to which he refer they be make by the government in the letter from the foreign and home secretaries that be despite ministers regularly say that the letter should give those concern comfort reroute the cable would we know cost million if the government be even think about that so ask the minister why do the government strongly deny rather than tell this house about the presence of the cable until the white house actually confirm it chinese state medium have report that the uk have give assurance to the chinese that the uk would allow the development no matter what indeed the guardian newspaper report in that the chinese would not apply again unless they be give governmental assurance can the minister confirm or even deny any of this speak as one of those in the chamber who have be sanction by china see this as project kowtow there have be one denial after another and one betrayal after another no wonder our ally believe that this chinese mega embassy be become walk of shame for the government thank the right hon member for those question hope he will appreciate not least because of the quasi judicial nature of the role of plan ministers in the planning process that can not comment on the detail of the application as have say no decision on the case have be make and the case be not yet before the department the right hon member mention cable but it would not be appropriate to comment on any specific national security issue on whether the chinese embassy issue be raise during uk us trade talk again it would not be appropriate to comment on the detail of those talk suffice it to say that we do not recognise the characterisation set out in the sunday times article in which that be reference it be important to emphasise that only material planning consideration can be take into account in determine this case as say can not comment in any detail on such case and this case be not yet before the department understand that the minister can not comment on this case or any individual case but national security be of the utmost concern to everybody in this country and in this chamber when an application come before the secretary of state and in grant application from foreign government will national security be material concern for the government thank my hon friend for his question as make clear in respond to the initial question the inspector report consider the application against publish local regional and national planning policy which be likely to include consideration of wide variety of material planning matter in this case that be likely to include safety and national security call the shadow secretary of state thank my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure this very important urgent question question after question and letter after letter the government have consistently treat parliament with complete disregard on this matter they have stonewall legitimate inquiry about national security ministerial discussion and warning from security body get that the minister be compromise in that he have quasi judicial responsibility here but his colleague in the home office and the foreign office do not and they could answer these question as the government know their own cyber security expert innovate uk have warn about the threat to the city of london from the embassy the wappe telephone and internet exchange be surround on three side by the new embassy and there be fibre cable carry highly sensitive information run beneath the site the secretary of state for science innovation and technology say yesterday that these matter could be deal with in the planning process but the inquiry have end so they can not if the government be consider move the cable how many million of pound of public money will that cost recently send yet another cross party letter to the prime minister sign by parliamentarian urge he to pause and reconsider since then the us and dutch government have both sound the alarm have and gchq be able to submit their own warning to the planning inspector do the inspector have access to unredacted plan of the embassy which the chinese government have refuse to make public have the government assess the potential sinister us of the secret basement in the so call cultural exchange building what discussion have take place with the bank of england give its role in cyber security regulation in the city why will the government not follow the example of the us australian and irish governments who veto similar embassy that threaten their national security the government be on the verge of make decision that will lead to huge risk that will persist for decade will they change course before it be too late appreciate that the shadow secretary of state remark be write before he listen to my response but could not have be clear about the fact that no decision have be make on this case and no application be yet before the it be question he be pre empte decision that have not be make on case that be not before the department have be very clear that should any further representation be make that raise material planning consideration they may in this case relate to safety and national security before decision be make these will be take into account but again as say to the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on matter of security it would not be appropriate for to comment on specific issue such as cable it would not be appropriate for to comment planning ministers have quasi judicial role in the planning process and as have say the case be not yet before the department be sure that the minister can understand the sensitivity of how we all feel about this china have track record of aggressive state back espionage surely this country can not afford to make massive underestimation of the risk should this go ahead as expect expert warn that there could be the foreign leverage of signal interception and monitoring of sensitive government and corporate communication to what extent can individual make representation because everyone be extremely concerned that such massive and historic building be sell some year ago this be pre empte this be how china work it plan year ahead we can not not say anything in this house we must comment on what we see please understand that we must do understand the strength of feeling convey by my hon friend and other hon member when it come to the people republic of china the government be take consistent long term and strategic approach to manage the uk relation with china root in the national interest we will always protect our national security and keep the country safe but those be separate issue from this specific planning application understand why she do so but she tempt to speculate again as have say on decision that have not be make on case that be not yet before the department call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for submit this urgent question the potential approval of the chinese super embassy send precisely the wrong signal at moment when we should be push the chinese government hard on human right abuse and their repression of the people of hong kong both in that city and right here on our street notwithstanding the risk of interception of sensitive comms at the site hongkongers and uyghurs be deeply worried about what it might mean for china expand surveillance capacity here in the uk in march alongside other opposition members speak at the protest in front of the propose site say the same thing to the minister as say that day the government must block it take into account the scale of opposition both domestically and by our ally will the minister confirm that representation make in this place will be consider as part of the planning approval process if may will also ask consider that the original timetable for the china audit to be publish have now pass will the minister tell the house when they expect finally to present it on the audit the hon gentleman final point the relevant minister the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west have confirm that that will be come before the summer he raise two very distinct issue and must treat they separately on human right we stand firm include against china repression of the people of xinjiang and tibet human right issue be raise every time fcdo minister meet their chinese counterpart on the application specifically he ask very direct question should any further representation be make by member or other interested party that raise material planning consideration that need to be take into account in decision they will be take into account and they will be consider before decision be make early this year speak at huge demonstration outside the propose embassy site which be attend by thousand of british hongkongers who fear that the hand that throttle their freedom in hong kong be reach into our society too understand the minister point and the limitation on what he can say on the issue at this time but this be not just matter of national security do he understand that it be also matter of personal security for many of our constituent give the increase in transnational repression emanating from beijing my hon friend have be vocal advocate for the hong kong community in his constituency and across the country we will stand with and support member of that community we have long share history with hong kong and many people from hong kong have make the uk their home in recent year again must emphasise this point and will continue to do so as question on this come in that be distinct and separate issue from the planning application that will in due course come before ministers in my department it be pleasure to speak after the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall today speak before he at the rally to which he refer those of we who have be sanction know that you madam deputy speaker be among our number be particularly conscious of the effect that the chinese state have on our country do you madam deputy speaker honestly believe that the minister think that the chinese would look at this proposal in the same way do we in this house honestly believe that something threaten our economic security as highlight by the americans and the dutch should go through bureaucratic planning process with no ability to vary it because frankly they the order do not think that be the way china would do it and it be certainly not the way we should do it it be very clever question but it be the minister who be respond the right hon gentleman view on china be well known and he know my view on china too we have discuss the matter in the past he raise two distinct issue on sanctioned parliamentarian let take this opportunity to make it clear that the sanction be completely unwarranted and unacceptable and this issue will remain priority under this government the foreign secretary and the chancellor have raise their case at every meeting with their counterpart include with president xi at the in november and foreign minister wang yi in february the right hon gentleman tempt to comment on the chinese planning system be very glad that we have different and more robust system than the people republic of china appreciate that the minister can not comment on individual planning application from the dispatch box but when speak to hongkongers in my constituency they be seriously concerned about the risk that come with transnational repression and that might come along with the creation and construction of this embassy when be speak with hongkongers in my constituency last week on the anniversary of the tiananmen square massacre something that can be commemorate in leeds but not in hong kong they be seriously concerned that those with bounty on their head might be more at risk now because of the construction of this embassy appreciate that the minister portfolio do not necessarily cover this but what assurance can he give on behalf of the government that if such an embassy be build we will do everything in our power to protect those from hong kong who have make the uk their home hope hon member will appreciate why will not comment on hypothetical again on decision that have not be make on case that be not before the department have make it very clear that we stand with the hong kong community the minister with responsibility for asia and the indo pacific my hon friend the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west meet member of the hong kong community in this country along with my hon friend the security minister we will stand by they the prime minister the chancellor of the exchequer and the foreign secretary have all have recent high level interaction with ministers of the chinese communist party the chinese government have the chinese embassy be bring up in any of the meeting with those ministers and have those ministers in any way correspond with the minister department on the chinese embassy application it would not be appropriate for to comment on the detail of any talk be not ask for detail the right hon gentleman be ask for detail and it would not be appropriate for to comment on the particular issue of whether representation have be make as make clear in answer the initial question the home and foreign secretaries make joint representation to the planning inspectorate ahead of the start of the inquiry and that will be take into account alongside all other relevant matter from response to freedom of information request which have with we now know that just two protest at the royal mint court site in february and march this year require the deployment of nearly officer in total include in february and in march the foi request reveal that the cost of police these two protest alone amount to this be staggering use of resource for site that be not yet operational and it reflect the serious concern among the hongkonger tibetan and uyghur diaspora in the uk these be community that fear that the embassy will become hub for transnational repression what assessment have ministers make of the cost implication of this propose development on policing and will they commit today to reject this super embassy be not go to commit to reject an application that have not yet come to the department and as keep say where decision have not be make have make it clear that we understand the concern of member of the hong kong community and other about the potential make clear that it be potential approval of this application when it come to police resourcing all can repeat be that only material planning consideration can be take into account in determine the case think we can all agree that we would like decision to be make in this case that do not encourage the chinese government to think that we be soft touch let we try another tack national security be go to be take into account as part of this planning decision ask the minister this hypothetical question if there be only chance that the granting of this planning application cause some detriment to our national security would it not be well to take risk management approach and put the embassy somewhere else the hon gentleman invite again to consider planning decision that have not be make on case that be not yet before the department be clearly not go to set out from this dispatch box the decision make process that plan ministers in my department might take to the application once it be submit give the serious concern about national security can the minister confirm that his department have consult on this issue with uk and ally intelligent agency include those of the usa can he say whether full national security review will be conduct before any planning decision be take as have make clear it would not be appropriate for to comment on any specific national security issue what have be at pain to make clear be that the inspector report which will come before ministers in my department at the point when the case come to we will include wide variety of material planning matter and in this case they be likely to include safety and national security matter far to the question from the hon member for rushcliffe james naish the home affairs committee have write to the metropolitan police ask for detail of any concern it may have about the policing of this site and any particular disorder that might occur around it once again put it to the minister that he must take account of these concern there could be very serious and significant concern for police in the capital all material planning consideration that have be bring to the attention of the inspector will be take into account as part of the decision when it be make in due course national security and security be valid planning consideration so do the minister accept that in the event that the secretary of state allow this decision to go ahead regardless of the planning inspector recommendation this government will essentially be put our relationship with china ahead of our security relationship with the united states that be pure speculation as have say it would not be appropriate for to comment on any national security matter do the minister believe that china will always try to exploit and infiltrate datum communication in this country widespread cyber activity or interference in our democracy will not be tolerate and will be meet with strong response move on from national security accord to the documentation have double check community safety be significant material planning consideration in such multicultural area what assessment of risk to community cohesion and the safety of local people be be make how do take such decision more centrally align with the government much publicise commitment to devolution do not know whether hon member can hear keep answer the question as pose and have answer that question if the issue that the hon lady raise be material planning consideration the inspector will take it into account in their recommendation to ministers to make decision once the case come to the department china be already revel in the government spectacular own goal in handing over chagos china look as if it be about to benefit again even if the minister can not say what amount be involve will he say what work would need to be do in advance of the embassy be set up at the royal mail site and who would pay for that would it be the chinese or would it be the uk government and which part as say public inquiry be hold between and february and all the relevant document submit to that inquiry be available online encourage the right hon gentleman to go and look at they again he invite to speculate on matter that be part of the application that the inspector will have consider in make his report and recommendation when that arrive to the department emphasise again that no case be yet with the department if national security be material consideration will that be judge only by what be in the inspector report if so how could that be adequate since the uk china audit will not have be publish before the inspector conclude his report at the point when the planning inspector report and recommendation be receive it will be determine by planning minister who will come to decision base on material planning consideration that have be analyse understand that the minister can not comment on the specific but do he at least agree with the principle that if there be risk that nation state will act nefariously against the british state interest the british government should not reward that state as have be at pain to make clear the government will always protect our national security and keep this country safe there be distinct issue from the planning application and the question about process that have be put to on that basis can not comment as the hon gentleman have acknowledge on decision that have not be make and on case that be not with the department my constituency be home to grow number of people from hong kong who have be force to flee their homeland as result of action by china appreciate what the minister say about this be quasi legal matter and the fact that foreign office minister be sit next to he speak volume about how this be not just planning issue do he agree that this country owe debt to hongkongers whom we need to protect from the chinese interference that they consider this super embassy would enable do recognise that point as have make clear the government will stand with and support member of the hong kong community as say do not know whether the hon gentleman be in the chamber for this the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west and the minister for security meet member of the hong kong community only recently we will continue to stand with they the minister have make it clear that he will not comment on the specific of the case and will not ask he to but can he offer view in principle on why we would ever offer foreign state with know cyber espionage capability that it deploy regularly easy access to critical cyber infrastructure again the hon gentleman be make assumption that do not recognise and thereby tempt to comment on the case be not go to make blanket in principle statement give the quasi judicial nature and involvement of plan ministers in the process lee anderson be you bob or not bob indicate dissent marvellous call jim shannon thank you very much madam deputy speaker be somewhat throw off there thank the minister for his answer he will be aware of concern that chinese bear resident in my constituency and across northern ireland have about the reach and indeed the overreach of the chinese government in the united kingdom can well understand us concern and with all due respect he know always ask my question with respect do the minister truly believe that this massive embassy will alleviate the concern of those who know good the reach of the chinese government arm should we not be show that while we will accord they courtesy as we do with other national embassy they be not entitle to chinese vatican city in the midst of this great nation of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland do recognise the concern the hon gentleman raise but forgive madam deputy speaker have to repeat again that no decision have be make in this case no case be yet with the department have lay out in quite some detail the process that have be follow in how the application have be take forward and what need to happen for ministers to reach decision at the appropriate point when case come to the department thing that seem politically and economically expedient at the time can become thing that government regret very much in the long term as find when be the telecom minister have to lead the billion strip out of huawei from our infrastructure it take only few minute for the prime minister to change his position on the chinese embassy after call from president xi jinping the minister have say he can not answer any question on the substance of the issue but on planning level will he commit personally to have secure briefing ahead of make any planning decision and also to publish and share with this house detail of all the representation he have receive on the planning application include those from his own government will take the two aspect of the hon lady question in turn if may we will be vigilant against the full range of hybrid cyber space and other threat from state and non state actor include those emanating from china on her specific question about the planning application all the representation make to the planning inspectorate as part of that public inquiry be publicly available for hon member to see minister when they come to make decision on the basis of the inspector report and recommendation will do so take into account material planning consideration be the planning officer who be consider this case clear to receive top secret information planning inspector be assess the case as part of public inquiry although recognise why the hon gentleman have ask the question be afraid it would not be appropriate for to comment on national security matter china be likely to continue seek advantage through espionage and cyber attack and through securing cutting edge intellectual property through legitimate and illegitimate mean those be not my word but the word of the government own strategic defence review give the sub threshold threat pose by china and its star role in the sdr where it be refer to explicitly alongside russia and iran why have china not be include in the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme ahead of any potential approval of its super embassy my hon friend the minister for asia and the indo pacific tell that that particular report be come forward in due course again on the planning application it would not be appropriate for to comment on specific national security issue but as have say material planning consideration include those relate to safety and national security will be take into account winter fuel payment on may the prime minister tell this house that the government want to extend eligibility for winter fuel payment to wide range of pensioner in england and wales today we be set out how this will happen for the come winter and the year ahead this will provide certainty for pensioner and ensure that payment can be make swiftly and automatically which be our priority hope this statement will also answer many of the question that hon member have raise with and other in recent week let set out for the house how this system will work all pensioner with income up to and include will benefit from support as will all those on pension credit and other income relate benefit the payment of per household or per household where there be someone aged over will be make to all pensioner household in england and wales individual pensioner with taxable income above will have any winter fuel payment automatically recover via his majesty revenue and customs without the need for they to take any action this will be via paye for the majority or in their self assessment tax return for those who already complete one no one will be bring into tax or into self assessment just to repay their winter fuel payment those that prefer not to receive payment can opt out of receive it as be previously the case before july where the household be not get an income relate benefit and there be more than one pensioner in the household share payment split across the recipient will be make this government have have to make tough decision it be right to mean test the winter fuel think the conservative party support means test the winter fuel payment we will find out in this debate shortly we have have to make take tough decision because of the disaster leave by the conservative party it be right to mean test the winter fuel payment on ground of fairness and fiscal sustainability most people accept that it make no sense to pay hundred of pound to pensioner irrespective of their income those on the high income do not need it and there be many other call on public spending the government have however listen to concern about the level of the mean test we be act to ensure that all low income pensioner receive support the new individual threshold be significantly above the income of pensioner in poverty and broadly in line with average earning it will mean that the vast majority over three quarter or million pensioner will benefit from winter fuel payment this change ensure that the means testing of winter fuel payment have no effect on pensioner poverty mean test the winter fuel payment in england and wales like this will save around million year subject to certification by the office for budget responsibility compare with the system of universal payment it will cost around billion in england and wales compare with the position last winter decision about the situation in scotland and northern ireland remain for their devolved administration in the usual way as the prime minister have previously set out these be change that will be fully fund at the next fiscal event the autumn budget that will ensure that final costing and funding decision come alongside the late forecast from the obr we will ensure that the government non negotiable fiscal rule be meet we be set out these change before the summer to ensure that more pensioner receive support this winter regulation will be lay in the come month to ensure that the payment be make and tax change will be legislate for in the finance bill want to spell out clearly today that pensioner do not need to do anything winter fuel payment will be pay automatically this winter to all pensioner who receive the state pension pension credit or anyone who have previously receive winter fuel payment similarly payment will be recover automatically through the tax system for those with an income of over pensioners will also continue to receive wide support our pension credit take up campaign have see almost award make thank hon member on both side of this house local authority and charity for their work on that campaign over million pensioner right across the uk be also benefit from the triple lock the full new state pension be set to increase by up to year over this parliament as result commend that support for pensioner and this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state feel for the minister send here by his boss to complete what must be the most humiliating climbdown government have ever face in their first year in office for nearly year the conservatives have campaign against this cut and for nearly year the government have try to hold out just four week ago stand here and ask the minister how long this tone deaf final stand could go on for loyally he hold the line he defend the cut one final time he say their plan for pensioner be right on track well today he have be send to end that courageous last stand and unless it be come next he have be send without the one thing that pensioner up and down the country deserve an apology let we be clear the government make choice to cut the winter fuel payment it be outrageous to claim that the economy have somehow improve from the day they make the cut and they know it in fact by almost every metric the opposite be true inflation be at the target now it be point higher more people be unemployed and growth forecast have be slash in half by the office for budget responsibility in the meantime the government have go to town with the country credit card borrowing be up debt be up who be the chancellor try to fool when she suddenly say she can afford this when before she could not the fact be that last winter she give pensioner fuel money to the union now she realise how unpopular that be so she be pretend that everything have change perhaps the most surprising thing be that she think anyone be take in accord to the government own analysis pensioner be plunge into poverty this year and extra pensioner end up in this winter their mistake have hurt people and it be cowardly not to own up to it just like their personal independence payment reform there be no consultation or proper assessment just self righteous insistence that what they be do should not be question there be certainly no thought for those affected or concern for the anxiety that their government by press release be cause this be what happen when government come into office with no plan no principle no idea what they want to achieve and no idea how to achieve it they just bumble from one mistake to another break promise after promise do they think they could try out new policy like try new mattress unwrap it see how it feel sleep on it for while but if it cause political backache send it back this rush reversal raise as many question as it answer it be clear that when the prime minister stand up and make his big turn announcement in pmq he have no plan and no idea how he be go to pay for it it be totally unfunded spending commitment where be the billion need to pay for this turn come from note that the minister have kick that can down the road until the budget the government claim that the change will not permanently add to borrowing so do that mean it will permanently add to taxation on the plan itself be this really the good system of means testing that the government could come up with be the minister sure that they have think it through or will this unravel too what happen if pensioner earn over year through non taxable income will they have to register for self assessment and start fill out tax return in their or interruption you do cover that why should someone earn tax income be disadvantaged be it fair that millionaire pensioner and their spouse might receive payment but two people earn will not what happen if someone die in the period between receive the payment and have to pay it back will the government go after the deceased person relative have two final question after all this the saving for the treasury for this coming year may be as little as million do the minister think it be worth it and will he apologise will deal directly with two of the question raise because it be important to provide reassurance the right hon lady ask what will happen with the estate of someone who be deceased want to be clear that his majesty revenue and customs will never pursue any estate for the winter fuel payment alone she also ask about the level of saving as set out in my statement the saving will be million year in england and wales that be very clear and it be significant saving more broadly the hon lady talk about an apology she come here represent the party of liz truss and lecture anybody else about apology she come here represent the party of flatline wage rise debt and increase in pensioner in poverty and ask anybody else to apologise have never hear such nonsense we have listen to pensioner for all her sound and fury she be at her most furious today still can not tell what the conservatives policy be month on for all the rhetoric and shout it sound like she might support the means testing of winter fuel payment after all that be the policy of her party leader who once also support means test the entire state pension in one of her bolder moment conservative members say that the policy be not much comfort to pensioner but age uk say the exact opposite charity director caroline abrahams say that this announcement be the right thing to do martin lewis say that it be big improvement interruption there be lot of chuntering from the conservative front benchers maybe their back benchers can work out what the front bench policy be by the time they get to their foot in few minute time have no idea whatsoever what the conservative party policy be more widely when it come to pensioner the government priority be to raise the state pension and rescue the nhs the triple lock will see state pension spending rise by billion annually over this parliament some billion be be invest into the nhs because we inherit in england disgraceful situation in which more than one in five pensioner age over be on waiting list there be no excuse for that legacy from the conservative party neither of those form of progress raise the state pension and investing in the nhs would be possible without the difficult decision that we have have to make on tax those be difficult decision that every opposition party have oppose only this government can provide that crucial support for pensioner because we will do what be necessary to turn that support from rhetoric into reality member on both side of the house will have have large volume of correspondence on this matter so thank the minister for his statement this fair policy change save our public service million by ensure that the wealthy pensioner do not continue to receive the winter fuel payment do he agree my hon friend set out the principle case for means test the winter fuel payment very well indeed do not think that anybody with common sense think it right that millionaire receive each year from the exchequer hundred of pound towards their winter fuel payment people have recognise that for year the government be make the tough choice of say that that we will no long pay the winter fuel payment in that way call the liberal democrat spokesperson our country need stability fear that this policy be from the book on how to botch run the country although last year decision be wrong and this change be right the liberal democrats have long campaign against those proposal and it be important to acknowledge independent age silver voices and age uk which have all drive the change government who wobble do not give we the stability we need for our economy some pensioner in devon and cornwall have be worry sick about the proposal so why do the government not implement this approach month ago the government comms have not be clear on single pensioner household about which there be grave concern so will the minister provide clarity on that matter what about household in which there be pensioner on high and low rate how will they be treat finally may have assurance that the government will continue to push hard on pension credit for the poor pensioner it can offer boost of year to their income which be the real way to tackle pensioner poverty in the uk thank the hon member for his comment and his welcome for this change he call it the right change he ask about different treatment of single and couple household can explain that in bit more detail single household will receive the entire household winter fuel payment to the one individual whether that be or if the individual income be below they will keep that in full and if the individual income be above that will be recoup by hmrc unless they choose to opt out with couple the situation for those not receive mean test benefit will be as it be before july which be split payment half to each member of the household and then they will be individually test against the tax system thank the hon member for give the chance to clarify that point also entirely endorse his statement about pension credit the reason we want to see high rate of pension credit take up be not because of winter fuel payment per se because that be small relative to the financial gain that come from people who be entitle to pension credit receive it we absolutely must maintain the progress on pension credit take up in the month and year ahead as say in my statement welcome the work of mps in their constituency and of local authority and charity in drive up those rate as chair of the all party parliamentary group for ageing and old people really do welcome the reinstatement of the winter fuel payment for million pensioner but since the announcement to remove it the energy price cap have go up so will the minister take look at the value of the winter fuel payment and perhaps turn to the industry which over the last five year have profit by billion perhaps it can make great contribution to help our poor pensioner my hon friend be right to raise question about energy price an issue for household of all age that have be live through the cost of live crisis of recent year the good news be that the energy price cap will be come down in july although think everybody across the house would like to see it fall significantly far this government have be take step over the last month to make sure that more household be get support with their energy bill member will have see the consultation on the doubling of eligibility for the warm home discount the work to significantly increase the spending on warm home insulation over billion this year and the extension of the household support fund right across the piece for household of all age not just for pensioner we do need to make sure that this be country where more people can afford to heat their home the truth be that the chancellor make chilling political choice last july and have now have to make screeching turn follow pressure from people across the house and outside this chamber will the minister take this opportunity to send an apology to all the low income pensioner in west worcestershire and elsewhere who have to shiver through last winter as be say we do need to make sure that low income family right across the board be receive the support they need that be why we set out change to free school meal last week and it be why we will be come forward with child poverty strategy in the week ahead have already explain why the original decision be take and set out that we have listen the important thing be that it be right to maintain the principle of means test winter fuel payment but to do so with high threshold as have set out the change we be bring forward today will mean that the vast majority of pensioner over three quarter will receive it in future welcome my hon friend announcement because this news will not only bring more money to scotland it also demonstrate that this be government who listen the winter fuel payment be devolve in scotland as it be at the time of the original announcement and the scottish national party current policy rob poor pensioner to fund payment for millionaire do my hon friend agree that the snp must now re examine its own policy in the light of this game change announcement today my hon friend be always quite right speak to ministers in the devolved administration today to set out in advance the detail of this policy and to spell out for example to ministers in edinburgh that if they want fair system that mean test the winter fuel payment and the equivalent in scotland for those on the high income hmrc be ready to support that but so far they have choose not to means test the system to have system that be not fair to poor pensioner the politic of turn be not always bad this be welcome turn by the government as people will benefit it would have be helpful for the minister to have say we make mistake but we be go to put it right but that be by the by however have have many letter and communication as be sure have many other hon member from across the house about group of people who be still suffer something like pensioner who be eligible for pension credit and therefore theoretically for the winter fuel payment apply for the winter fuel payment but have not receive single penny for last winter whatever other change be make will the minister commit to put that situation right so that those pensioner will receive the money that they should have have during the winter the right hon gentleman be right to highlight the issue of low take up of pension credit and he refer to the figure of more than pensioner which unfortunately be true under the last government we have see unprecedented level of pension credit application over the past year because of the campaign by the government and by hon member from all party those application be very welcome but agree that we need to keep up the momentum in the short term we be write to all new housing benefit claimant who we think could be eligible for pension credit and encourage they to apply we be engage in new research about what have work in the drive for pension credit take up which largely seem to be awareness of the benefit and we be look at well datum sharing with local authority and across central government departments include between the department for work and pensions and his majesty revenue and customs welcome today announcement it be right that despite the horrendous financial situation that this government inherit from the conservative party they be reinstate the winter fuel payment for of pensioner and specifically target those in the most need follow the question from my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter will the minister outline what discussion he expect to have with scottish ministers about the scottish government universal approach to winter fuel payment in scotland at time when public service in scotland be face significant peril the snp position be to continue to give winter fuel payment to millionaire at time of deep hardship for people in scotland my hon friend be right to highlight the targeting set the mean test threshold at ensure that it be well above the income level of pensioner in poverty and be around the average earning level on policy in scotland an important principle of devolution be that those be decision for the scottish government but they be also decision for which they will be hold accountable over several fiscal event over seven year the option of remove the winter fuel payment from the wealthy be resist by the previous government because there be not see to be an effective rationing mechanism and there be considerable presentational challenge will the minister confirm that pensioner with no mortgage and with significant tax wrap saving in individual saving account or venture capital trust but with monthly pension of will still be fully entitle to receive the winter fuel payment always enjoy discuss technical detail with the right hon gentleman set the position out clearly in my initial statement mean testing be base on taxable income of which answer his question the original decision to cut the winter fuel payment be the wrong decision today decision be the right decision and much fairer decision in my constituency more pensioner will quite rightly get the winter fuel payment again it be clear that the government have listen so ask they to listen again to the grow call in the chamber and to scrap their plan devastating cut to disability support thank my hon friend for welcome today policy announcement we will continue to discuss with he all aspect of how his constituent be treat in the social security system on the wide question that he raise will say that the government have obviously set out the position think the position of most people in the country that we can not continue with position where one in eight young people be out of work or where we see people day flow on to personal independence payment we need well system focus on support those who can work into work the minister for social security and disability be set out the case on that do not think anybody should support the position of leave the status quo as it be no matter how the minister try to dress it up the chancellor make monumental political mistake last year while welcome the news that the payment be be reinstate it be cold comfort to those pensioner who miss out last year and face really difficult choice over the winter will the minister look at this issue again and reinstate the winter fuel payment for all those who miss out this be why be confused what be the position of the conservative party be it to support means testing of the winter fuel payment yes or no be you go to send out the shadow chancellor to give speech order be you go to send do not think the minister be speak to the chair be the conservative party go to send out the shadow chancellor to give speech in which can not tell whether he be apologise for liz truss then come to this house the very next week and call for universal winter fuel payment if the conservatives be call for universal winter fuel payment they need to set out how that will be fund this be government who have make their choice it be right to mean test the winter fuel payment because millionaire should not receive it if the conservatives do not know what their policy be on that they will not know their policy on anything else have not meet anyone other than john swinney perhaps who think that millionaire should get the winter fuel payment have meet lot of constituent who feel that the threshold be too low and the government have recognise that today however the minister know well than most that while some pensioner still struggle pensioner poverty have fall in recent time whereas child poverty have go in the opposite direction will he use some of the nearly million save through this measure and direct it towards the grandchild rather than the grandparent and to where poverty be most acute in our society as always thank my hon friend for his well put thought he be absolutely right that pensioner poverty fall significantly halve under the last labour government before unfortunately rise by people under the conservatives but we must not be complacent about the headline of fall pensioner poverty because there be wide problem interruption be glad that the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart welcome it the point be come to be that the stagnate income of working age household under the last labour government move across to stagnant income for pensioner and no fall in absolute poverty for pensioner under the conservatives there be subset of pensioner such as single pensioner private renter and other where we see last problem it be important to see this in the round but my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall be absolutely right to say that we must move far on child poverty he will have see last week announcement on free school meal in england with consequential for the devolved administration and we will come forward far with child poverty strategy soon welcome this government turn countless pensioner in woking suffer last winter so be pleased that that will not continue the minister state that be the threshold that he and the government have choose because it be the average earning will the government commit to increase that threshold go forward when average earning rise that be an important question there be always judgment in choose threshold for any means test benefit and want to be completely straight with the house about that we have choose threshold that be well above the income level of pensioner in poverty and it will ensure that more than three quarter of pensioner receive the benefit of the winter fuel payment in england and wales the hon gentleman be right that it be currently in line with average earning it be important to have clarity for pensioner point that the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for torbay steve darling just make we will leave the at the current level as all threshold in the income tax system be freeze for the come year so that pensioner know that that be the threshold and there be no surprise decision about future uprating will be for future budgets very much welcome the minister statement today it be the right thing to do to lift pensioner out of poverty be sure that both he and the chancellor also agree that it be right to lift child out of poverty so can he reassure this house that he and the chancellor be do all they can to outline plan to lift the two child cap on universal credit as soon as possible as my hon friend know we have say clearly that all lever to reduce child poverty be on the table the child poverty strategy will be publish in the autumn but we be not wait for that as say early we have already see action on free school meal it be another reason why we need to see more support for energy bill and for insulate home in particular because it be young family with child who be struggle most and have to turn off their heating my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this issue which be one of the core purpose of this government we can not carry on with situation in which huge percentage of large family be in poverty assume that because the minister can not find the word sorry in his vocabulary this afternoon he expect pensioner in north dorset and elsewhere to be say thank you to he for this screech turn however just few week ago what he have announce today be predict to cause financial armageddon when should the city of london mortgage payer and everybody else now expect the run on the pound that be predict by the leader of the house of commons what this government be do be sort out the mess in the public finance leave by the conservative party and not repeat its irresponsibility all opposition party oppose all of the tax rise set out in the autumn budget yet claim that they support the spending on the nhs and on pensioner they can not have it both way the party of liz truss have not learn its lesson no one have speak to in derby think that millionaire should be receive the winter fuel allowance but many will welcome the lifting of the threshold so that more people receive it do the minister agree that this show the government listen it show money be target at where it be need and it show what can be do with stable economy my hon friend be completely right as say we have set the threshold at level that mean that the vast majority of pensioner not just in her constituency but right across england and wales will receive support in the come winter importantly we be announce the threshold now to make sure those payment can be make in time for this winter when the chancellor slash the winter fuel allowance last year she tell we that it be necessary urgent and the responsible thing to do it turn out that it be not necessary urgent or the responsible thing to do after all so be the minister go to apologise to the million of pensioner who be put through the wringer so cruelly and unnecessarily think he know that they deserve an apology from this government have perform one turn will the government now do the same for the country poor family and abolish the two child cap thank the hon member for his question have just refer to the progress that need to be make on reduce child poverty not just in england and wales but in scotland we will set out that strategy in the come month and he be absolutely right to say that we should all want to see very significant progress on that issue in the year ahead when it come to the winter fuel payment in england and wales the equivalent benefit be obviously devolve in scotland so that be question for ministers in edinburgh welcome the decision today and be delighted to hear the announcement from the minister let we be crystal clear this be direct result of the progress that this labour government be make in turn around our economy for my constituent however the future of the winter fuel payment or its equivalent lie in the hand of the scottish government can the minister confirm that the barnett consequential to scotland result from today announcement will exceed what the scottish government be already plan to spend on their equivalent of the winter fuel allowance hon member will the hon lady give way will he join in urge the scottish government to follow suit and ensure that the additional fund that be provide due to today decision will restore the full winter fuel payment to all those who need it in order please be seat do not need any help with manage the chamber but question need to be short minister let we have short sharp answer my short sharp answer be that wage have grow in the first month of this government fast than in the first year of the last conservative government interest rate have be cut four time my hon friend be right to say that progress be be make and that need to continue we need to ensure that more people feel the benefit of that growth in their pocket the change we be make to winter fuel payment today be one of those benefit can confirm that there will be block grant adjustment exactly as she set out appreciate that this have be humiliation for the chancellor and that her credibility be in tatter no wonder she be not here today to announce her own turn but now that she and the government have get taste for climbdown may urge they through the minister who unfortunately draw the short straw today to reverse the equally ridiculous national insurance contribution rise which be destroy job and the inheritance tax change which be destroy farm and family business it be usual for minister to thank the member for their question but actually mean it in this case because the right hon lady have completely prove my point that the conservatives have learn no lesson whatever they think they can come to this chamber and call for more spending and oppose every tax rise and they expect to be take seriously ever again they will not be as labour mp who vote against the winter fuel payment cut welcome this change in position but urge the minister and the government to learn the lesson one of they be to listen to back benchers if the minister and the government listen to back benchers we can help the government get it right and help they avoid get it wrong we do not want to be here in year or two time with minister send to the dispatch box to make another turn after not listen to back benchers on disability benefit cut if they listen now we can help the government get it right it be important to listen to back benchers and to front benchers it be even important to listen to opposition members on occasion particularly when they be dig their own grave with their party policy more seriously the point that my hon friend raise be important everybody on the government benches want to make sure that this be fair country that be grow again that wage be grow that poverty be fall that inequality be come down that be what we need to deliver sometimes that will involve tough choice include all the one that the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey oppose those choice will need to be make because we be party of government not party of protest but they be make in the interest of our value and of fair country and fairer britain the minister come to this house almost triumphant have vote to take away winter fuel payment minimum number of month before winter and now say that we should be thank he for this reinstatement anguish anxiety uncertainty that be what my pensioner suffer will he apologise the hon gentleman be try to put word in my mouth and he will not succeed we have be clear what say in my statement be that we have come to the house today before the summer recess particularly to deal with the issue that he be raise which be to provide absolute certainty for pensioner in england and wales that they will be receive the winter fuel payment this winter if their income be below agree with he that that be an important level of certainty to provide and that be why be here today rise order give another reminder to colleague that question must be short as must answer otherwise many colleague will be disappoint share the deep concern of my constituent about the loss of the winter fuel payment which the minister will know relay to the department be glad that the government have act on those concern and review the threshold so that the majority of pensioner will receive the payment this winter do the minister agree that in stabilise the economy we be now in well position to do what labour government have always do well protect the vulnerable in our society that be exactly the point have just make what be labour governments here for build fair britain what do the last labour government do they bring down child poverty halve pensioner poverty and raise wage year after year that be what this government will do again have listen to the minister statement and read the word too and nowhere can see an explanation for why this decision have come now month after it be first announce why have this decision come now will we have to wait another month for the government to rethink their cut to disability benefit have just explain why we be make this announcement now we want to ensure that the payment can be make in time for the winter have not hide from the fact that last year we make the difficult decision to mean test the winter fuel payment and that be the right choice to make but we have listen which be why we have announce high mean test have directly answer the hon member question this be important but we do need to make some tough decision know that the liberal democrats want universal winter fuel payment because they think it right to pay hundred of pound to millionaire but take different view think it be that kind of wishful thinking that create in liberal democrat government who promise to scrap tuition fee and end up treble they thank the minister for his statement which know will be greatly welcome by my constituent over year we become used to government who do not listen and do not change course when circumstance change so for one be grateful for labour government who do so while there be an uptick in pension credit question will the minister commit himself again to work with local government and devolve administration to increase the number of people receive pension credit so that pensioner on the low income do not lose out but receive the support that they need that be very important point whatever the view express in the house today say to all member that if any of they want to suggest way in which we can continue to drive up pension credit and ensure that the poor pensioner receive the support to which they be entitle will always be happy to talk to they as my hon friend the member for north dorset simon hoare ably recall the minister superior tell we that there would be run on the pound unless pensioner take hit on winter fuel give that every economic indicator be bad last year can the minister tell we whether the pound be safe with this turn or whether this be just another example of his senior talk utter bilge to justify their terrible decision it be the hon member who be talk bilge growth be the high in the in the first quarter of this year interest rate have fall four time and wage have rise fast in month than they do in year under the conservatives what be happen be that we be sort out their mess and put britain on well track do the minister agree that give that our be now the fast grow economy in the and interest rate have be cut four time now be the time to ensure that our public service will be protect and that pensioner who do not need the winter fuel payment to heat their home will not receive it while those who do need it to heat their home will receive it should have get out of the way because my hon friend have give direct rebuttal to what be say by the hon member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez he be entirely correct in every detail of the important point that he have raise labour government invest in public service and end austerity that be what we will be hear about in the house on wednesday and look forward to hear conservative members explain how they try to support that spending while oppose every tax rise that be necessary to make it happen welcome the minister statement not least because it will offer much support and reassurance to so many of my constituent as he know no system be perfect and mistake will be make so may ask whether there will be an appeal mechanism for those who be entitle to the winter fuel payment but for whatever reason do not receive it thank the hon member my near neighbour for that question no bureaucracy be perfect but in such case we do not need an appeal mechanism we just need to ensure that those people receive the payment as soon as possible as have say we have make this decision to ensure that we can automatically make winter fuel payment to people who be receive all the benefit that mention and who also receive the payment previously the success rate of that payment mechanism be strong which be why have make this announcement today however if any member have any constituent in that position ask they to get in touch with immediately welcome the government decision and thank they for listen to member on both side of the house many of my old constituent live in house that be not energy efficient which result in high bill so can the minister say more about what the government be do to increase energy efficiency in home to keep they warm and bring down bill that be such an important point one of the big mistake that we make in previous decade be say we will not see the benefit of work to improve the quality of the housing stock for year so let we slash it that be exactly what happen in when there be cut in the level of insulation under the energy company obligation scheme and we have pay the price for that ever since this government be not go to make the same mistake my right hon friend the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have be ramp up the warm home programme and we need to be out there insulate home and improve loft every day until britain have housing stock of which it can be proud many of my elderly constituent have an unnecessarily cold and miserable winter and the uncertainty to which the minister constantly refer be of his government own making will he take this opportunity to apologise to my constituent the right hon member be right to highlight that we need to provide support for old people and for all household with their energy bill right through the year which be what this government have be do we have not be wait as say the warm home discount be be extend to almost million extra household we be roll out the improvement to the insulation programme that have just mention and the household support fund have be extend for future year that be exactly what we need to do while at the same time improve our energy security and our energy generation to make sure that in future we do not see the disaster of the last five year when global wholesale gas price send electricity and gas price here in the uk through the roof thank the minister for his statement which will be warmly welcome by constituent particularly pensioner who be just above the threshold and who lose out last winter do he agree that measure such as roll out free breakfast club visit one this morning at goodyers end primary school be make real difference by tackle poverty and that that be what this government be do across the board in all age group could not agree more with my hon friend we need to make sure that we be see child poverty fall and see extra help for family through free school meal as well as through the breakfast club that she mention we also need to see more progress on pensioner poverty that be why today we be say that the threshold will be well above the income of pensioner who be in poverty we do not want to see that poverty in the year ahead which be exactly why we have make this change today while the government bury their head in the sand countless pensioner suffer such as my constituent who despite have terminal disease have to cut back on heating and food and spend the winter freeze cold can the minister explain why no impact assessment be conduct last year before winter fuel payment be strip from million of pensioner thank the hon lady for her question but the equality analysis be do unusually the poverty impact analysis be also publish over the last year do not agree with the statement that she have just make but she be right to say that we need to make sure that we be improve thing for pensioner as say before this government priority be to keep raise the state pension and to rescue the nhs as say one in five be currently on an nhs waiting list and the funding to make that happen be possible only because of the tax rise that hear the liberal democrats oppose week in week out welcome the minister announcement and the change in course from the government many of we be uneasy about the low threshold for the winter fuel payment especially in deprive community such as mine have the most deprived borough in the country will the minister assure my constituent that all pensioner under the threshold will automatically receive the new winter fuel allowance and will not have to do single thing in the winter to come that be an absolutely crucial point and have be central to the work that we have do to decide on the policy we want system of automatic payment so that pensioner do not need to do anything to claim the payment and one that be automatic for those who have income above so that they do not have to take action if they need to have the funding recoup unless they choose to opt out my hon friend be absolutely right we need simple system that support pensioner the minister talk about the nhs and wonder whether he recognise the number of elderly people who have to use the nhs as result of have be cold because of his policy want to ask he very specific question he say all pensioner with income up to and include will benefit from support he also say individual pensioner with taxable income above will have any winter fuel payment automatically recover through the tax system where household have two individual over the eligible age what happen when one earn more than and the other earn less will they get some all or half of the winter fuel payment think have answer that question but be happy to lay it out again if that be helpful there be long stand principle of individual taxation which think be support by all party in this house where couple be not receive means test benefit they will each receive half of their household winter fuel payment whether they continue to keep that or it be recoup through the tax system will be base on their individual taxable income for example if one have an income above their payment will be recoup by hmrc automatically but if the other have an income level below they will retain the winter fuel payment hope that clarify thing would my hon friend help clear something up the opposition party seem to be claim that they urge we to make this decision but that be not true be it they actually urge we to give winter fuel payment to millionaire at the expense of our public service can clear that up in the case of the liberal democrats and reform they have the same policy not for the first time might add which be definitely to give winter fuel payment to millionaire have no idea what the position of the conservative party be and have be here for an hour and quarter actually have be in the house for the last month and have still not be able to fathom what the conservative party policy be but think it be to not learn any lesson from liz truss during the general election campaign that well know political giant labour spokesman say that labour have no plan to change the winter fuel payment but within week the government have cruelly cut it withdraw it from million of pensioner and month later the minister be perform this screech turn give the hokey cokey nature of this policy can he give an assurance from the dispatch box that what he be announce will apply not just this winter but every winter in this parliament the point about certainty for pensioner be important think that be the point the hon gentleman be make as say early we be set the threshold so that people become aware of it in the come month it be round number and we do not intend to change it in the year ahead although far in the future yes there will be question about uprating which will be consider in the normal way welcome the fact that the government be respond to the huge public pressure and be expand eligibility for winter fuel payment be concerned that we be about to make similar mistake which once again we will come to regret in cut disability benefit will the treasury drop those cut before they cause harm to our constituent instead of reverse they after the fact have listen carefully to what my hon friend have say to be clear be not ask he to keep the status quo or to not support people into work be simply ask he not to cut disabled people benefit thank my hon friend for her question and we always have interesting conversation the minister for social security and disability will have hear the point she make gently say that the number of people receive personal independence payment be forecast to continue to grow in every single one of the year ahead that be after change be set out by this government that important point sometimes get lose in this debate welcome the fact that the government be finally listen to the public and do turn on winter fuel payment which be long overdue however in truly strategic approach to tackle fuel poverty we would make sure that every home could be heat affordably and be well insulated will the government commit to invest in the national asset that be our housing stock and to properly fund the warm home programme so that no pensioner no child nobody be condemn to fuel poverty in cold home yes that be exactly what we be do and we be fund that because this government know that we need to make difficult decision and will make they so that we can deliver priority such as investment in well housing stock welcome this news which will mean that more pensioner in bracknell forest receive this important benefit and the government recommitment to the triple lock do the minister agree that conservative party that can not decide whether it support give winter fuel payment to millionaire whether it back the triple lock or even whether liz truss be member be in no position to govern this country every again obviously agree with my hon friend in lot of way but it be really important to dwell on the point that he make at the beginning of his question through these change the vast majority of pensioner over three quarter will receive winter fuel payment this winter we can give they the necessary reassurance that they do not need to do anything for that to happen even if they be on high income the minister be at pain to say that pensioner do not have to do anything to get this payment but of course they have to do something they have to write to email and call labour mp and tell they that this cut be wrong at the time the justification labour mps give for the cut be the economic circumstance give that inflation and unemployment be high and growth be low than it be go to be be not the time for labour mp to listen before the cut not after it no because this government be form on the back of disastrous public finance the conservative party have announce public spending commitment without have penny to pay for they we will not apologise for do the right thing to put this country back on an even keel on september say in this house that represent england cold and snowiest constituency where even people on living wage can be in fuel poverty as can child and pensioner that be why as the minister know press the government not only for the change that he have announce today but to widen the eligibility criterion for the warm home discount scheme which be the smart mechanism we have for tackle genuine fuel poverty he have only go and do both those thing so can thank he for listen not to but to the people represent what assessment have be make of the impact of these change on lift child out of fuel poverty obviously thank my hon friend for his question but have to disagree do not deserve any credit for double eligibility for the warm home discount the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh who be here on the government front bench deserve it on fuel poverty estimate over million household should benefit from the warm home discount next year that will make real difference to household right across the country greatly welcome this overdue turn but if be the correct cap why do the government impose misery on million of pensioner last winter be not basic part of get something wrong say sorry it be not enough to say look at all the thing the conservative party do that be not the point the point be that this government think they be well than everyone else why will they not say sorry over the past year this government have be get on with provide more support for pensioner raise the state pension ensure the triple lock extend the household support fund and invest in the nhs the state of which be the single big betrayal of pensioner in england we believe in and support the principle of mean test the winter fuel payment but have listen and have look again at the threshold that be what have set out today very much welcome raise the threshold for the winter fuel allowance as be sure the minister know the threshold be at the heart of my concern about mean test although the principle of means testing be absolutely correct morecambe and lunesdale have an old than average population can the minister assure that my pensioner will not have to do anything special make any application to get their winter fuel allowance can absolutely give my hon friend that assurance we want to make sure that the vast majority of pensioner can receive winter fuel payment we want to make that as easy as possible which mean make receipt automatic the minister seem unable to say sorry but do he at least regret that more than more elderly people go to last winter than do the year before in the last winter under the conservative government over the last few year since energy bill have rise for all household and far too many people have be struggle that be absolutely right and the government be focus on address it through the warm home discount and the warm home scheme which provide the insulation that the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns mention we need to do that right across the board include in the long run by fix our break energy system have speak to many people in north east derbyshire who although they acknowledge that we should not give this payment to millionaire be deeply concerned that the threshold be too low can the minister reassure my constituent that those who be eligible for the payment will not have to apply for it absolutely can as say we need to provide the reassurance that the vast majority of pensioner will receive this support and will not have to do anything to get the payment in their bank account the cut to winter fuel allowance and the subsequent turn have cause much anguish distress and misery to the parliamentary labour party judge by the question from the minister back benchers it seem that we will have two furth turn on pip and on the two child benefit cap to save his colleague the anguish will he let we know now when those turn be come what labour mps want be labour government who bring down child poverty and that be what we will do they want government who take responsible decision include difficult one on tax and on mean test the winter fuel payment so that we can invest in public service and turn around the disgrace that there have be in britain public realm for far too long welcome this announcement as will the pensioner in my constituency where we have particularly cold and harsh winter will the minister reassure my constituent that automatic payment will be reinstate and will there be any change to the date on which payment will be make will not adjudicate on which member have the cold constituency in england as my hon friend invite to she raise an important point that have not yet be make so should spell this out we will bring forward the regulation on the payment of the winter fuel allowance over the summer and they will set the qualifying week as that of september as it have be in past year that mean that payment will be make in november and december as in past year shocking of scottish pensioner say that they be leave cold in their home last winter do the minister agree that the scottish government must use the additional funding from today announcement to ensure that pensioner in scotland receive the same amount of winter fuel payment as they do under the previous uk conservative government as be sure the hon gentleman be aware those be decision for the scottish government however as say have speak to the relevant ministers in the scottish government today there will be block grant adjustment to reflect this high spending in england and wales thank the minister for his statement and for the extensive time he spend with the work and pensions committee last week our inquiry on pensioner poverty have find that this issue be multifaceted and complex can the minister assure that he will work cross government on policy that will ensure that pensioner poverty be thing of the past my hon friend raise the important issue of the complexity of pensioner poverty will just give one example which do not get mention in these discussion often enough the growth rate the value people be get the return on every pound save into private pension absolutely need to be as strong as possible private pension support the living standard of our pensioner we need pension industry that be focus on drive the good possible value for saver there appear to be universal support for this damascene conversion by the government last year they tell pensioner that the right course of action be to scrap the winter fuel payment for million but they be now tell they that means test system be right so how can pensioner possibly believe anything that the government say do we actually get conservative party policy there be the hon member say that the conservatives support today announcement interruption that be no we do not have an answer yet after an hour and minute on what the conservative party policy be can give he the answer that he would like yes we will provide certainty that this be the policy of this government we could have go fast in the past hour and minute if the minister be fast with his answer have work hard with citizens advice bournemouth christchurch and poole in my constituency to get pensioner on to pension credit however on the doorstep have meet far too many people especially single woman who be or even over the threshold for pension credit welcome the statement and thank the minister for listen to my constituent concern about the threshold do he agree that this policy show the difference between this government and the previous one this government be do what be necessary to get stability in our economy what be fair to get money back into our public service and what be right to protect the vulnerable in our society thank my hon friend for her question and in particular for her hard work to drive take up of pension credit forget winter fuel payment pension credit be really important lifeline for low income pensioner it be worth an average of to those receive it and far too many be miss out thank my hon friend for her work and hope that it continue today turn be an astonishing victory against the government whose support have dry up after less than year in office when the government announce their cruel cut to the winter fuel payment cost bradford district pensioner vital support expert across the country warn that up to life could be at risk as people be force to choose between heating and eat now that the majority of the winter fuel payment have be restore do the government dare to produce figure for how many pensioner may have lose their life as result of the government choice to remove the winter fuel allowance that be serious matter there be poor household with people of all age that have be struggle with energy bill in recent year be sure that all of we across this house want to see those problem address we have also see increase in food price over the last few year that be high than we would like and it be low income household that spend high proportion of their budget on essential such as food energy and housing it be the policy of this government to ensure that we be deal with all those issue the median average income of pensioner in rochdale be which be way below the amount we expect people to live on with the national living wage so thank the minister for today announcement do he agree that it prove that the government have listen not only to opposition mp but to mps in the labour party who have push for this for so long and more importantly to the pensioner we represent my hon friend be right that we have to make difficult decision last year and understand that labour members have raise those with the government it be why we look again at the threshold and be stick to the principle of means testing while set high threshold so that the vast majority of pensioner over three quarter will now receive winter fuel payment welcome the partial reinstatement of the winter fuel payment when we meet the minister and discuss the cliff edge that exist last winter which mean that people in receipt of pension credit could in some case leapfrog the income of people in receipt of small private pension can the minister indicate whether the new mean test will remove that eligibility cliff edge remember discuss exactly that with the hon member all mean test have pro and con but by have much high threshold in particular high threshold relative to the level of payment with or be receive by individual the large unfairness he talk about where small difference in income lead to large difference in outcome be far reduce use to work for age scotland so may say how welcome it be that the government have listen to old people charity and make today announcement understand it will mean some million additional funding for the payment in scotland do my hon friend agree that snp ministers should now rethink their plan and instead endorse scottish labour plan which be first propose last november and would mean more generous payment for the pensioner who need they most be glad to hear about my hon friend previous role and it be encouraging to see what charity represent old people have put out over the last few hour as say early age uk have say that this be the right thing to do and that it will bring much need reassurance for old people and their family appreciate that the minister do not get chance to spend long on the back benches such have be his accelerated rise up the ministerial pole but would he like to spare thought for his former back bench colleague and join in thanking and congratulate the small band of labour back benchers who go public break cover and oppose this dreadful policy agree that we should welcome all labour back benchers because they be the people go through the lobbies every day to keep in place labour government who be save public service take tough but fair decision on tax decision that be oppose by all the opposition party rescue our public service and drive down poverty that be what labour government be about and that be what everyone on the labour benches agree on welcome today statement as one of the mp who speak against the decision to mean test the winter fuel payment last year pay tribute to all the campaigner who have lobby hard for change in policy do the minister agree that mean testing have once again fail and that effectively what we be see today be the return of labour commitment to universalism and to use the taxation system to get money back from those who be well off think agree with my hon friend in the sense that the tax system be progressive tax system that be the purpose for which it be be use in this case to drive fair outcome for pensioner and so that millionaire do not receive the benefit of winter fuel payment but all low and middle income pensioner do the northern ireland executive be to receive consequential budget adjustment may ask the minister when it will receive that adjustment so that we can ensure that our northern ireland pensioner get winter fuel payment in the come winter absolutely recognise the hon member question and speak to the northern ireland executive early today we will ensure that the executive receive the budget adjustment in year in order to provide the same support in line with the principle of parity under which the social security system in northern ireland operate the answer be yes that support and funding will be there away from the knockabout of westminster politic and people in telford welcome this change the principle of means testing be right but the level be too low do my hon friend agree that millionaire mp who happen to be of pensionable age and those who be live abroad should not receive this payment almost always agree with my hon friend so the answer be yes he also provide with an opportunity to clarify point that have not be cover in the last hour or so the payment will continue not to be exportable for those not resident in the report july vol correction do the minister agree that those pensioner who miss out on their payment in the winter of and will qualify under these rule should be reimburse for the money they lose my view be that all pensioner be be support by our high level of the basic state pension and the new state pension support by the difficult decision that the government have be able to take all pensioner will be support by function nhs which be what we be put in place after the disgrace of the last year to answer the hon member question directly we be set out the system for future year and not for the past this be welcome news that will bring even more money to scotland on top of the record funding settlement that our chancellor deliver in the budget do the minister agree that my constituent fear the scottish government and john swinney plan to pay out just in scotland those who need it most will now get more in england and wales than the snp will pay out to pensioner in scotland double in fact because the scottish government seem determined to pay out to the very wealthy millionaire in scotland should they rethink that can not compete with my hon friend in make powerful case that the snp government in edinburgh do need to think again in my constituency over pensioner lose the winter fuel allowance of whom be over would the minister like to apologise to the gentleman who write to who have cancer and could not keep his heating on for the winter of worry he be put through thank the hon member for raise that point it be important that those in need of healthcare in particular receive support it be not that we see high level of challenge in keep the heating on among old generation it be about the consequence of that particularly in case such as the one she raise that be exactly why we need to ensure that we be turn around the nhs which all the constituent of hon member in england be rely on we be see improvement to wait time in wales as well thank the minister for his leadership on this issue if he be look for example of how to increase the uptake of pension credit he be welcome to visit my constituency to see the work that the community help and advice initiative be do with to maximise benefit if he come along to one of those session with the dove centre he can also get warm meal and game of bingo but the threshold be much more generous than as tight fisted scotsman would have expect so will he explain how he reach that value it be fair question all mean test threshold do involve judgment have be completely honest with the house about that and the judgment we have come to be that we want to see the vast majority of pensioner receive the winter fuel payment we want to be absolutely sure that no low income pensioner will miss out that be what bring we to threshold it also mean that those on high income the rich or of pensioner will not receive it the minister may be in denial but this turn be humiliation for the chancellor who claim that economic stability demand take money from vulnerable pensioner and for all the labour mps who vote for it why do the government not listen soon to those who campaign against these cruel cut will he now apologise to my constituent and those across the country who be cold last winter this be chancellor who have bring stability and growth back to the economy and get wage grow once again one who be drive investment in our public service which will rescue they one who have drive up public investment which be crucial to show that once again we be country that can do the basic like build house fill pothole and the rest when the policy be originally announce hon member across the house and constituent of mine all share the same basic view that mean testing be fair but the threshold be far too low therefore welcome the government decision today and the fact that they be listen over the last winter work with the citizen advice bureau in hartlepool we secure nearly million of additional annual income for hartlepool pensioner do that not show the work that need to be do on all those unclaimed benefit not go to the pensioner who need they congratulate my hon friend on the work that he and other have be involve in in hartlepool drive up the take up of all benefit so that people get the support to which they be entitle be important for ensure that more poor household be able to eat to heat their home and to live decent life do not know where scottish labour mp have be for the past six month but the scottish government have already make it abundantly clear that we will reintroduce winter fuel payment and we would have do that with or without this embarrassing screech turn here be another place where the minister can follow the scottish government the two child benefit cap we vow to ensure that it will disappear in scotland will he now make the same pledge across the uk the hon gentleman ask where scottish labour mp have be so will tell he campaign in hamilton make sure there be labour msp and that in year time there will be labour government in edinburgh once again away from some of the consternation of this place glance at his majesty treasury distributional analysis will reveal that the original decision to protect the most vulnerable the budget that follow the spring statement and hope the spending review have be some of the most progressive fiscal decision we have see in recent year will the minister join and the many wealthy pensioner in my constituency who agree that mean testing be the right decision the progressive decision and the labour decision that be absolutely right think every member of this house will have hear from people on high income who think it make no sense at all that they receive hundred of pound from the government each year with the sensible decision to mean test yes to the high threshold we have bring that to an end the government cut to the winter fuel payment be estimate to have impact pensioner in my constituency so welcome today turn those affect include my constituent chrissy who be just above the threshold and now have the add fear that she will lose her personal independence payment do the minister understand why chrissy be so angry and afraid have already discuss with the hon member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord the question of people just over the pension credit threshold recognise that issue and have speak to pensioner in that situation as say we have listen and that be why we have put in place much high threshold which mean that chrissy if she be near to the pension credit threshold will be receive winter fuel payment this year thank the minister for his statement which pensioner in harlow will welcome the fast growth in the three trade deal and four interest rate cut be that the context in which the minister feel we be able to provide more pensioner in harlow with the winter fuel allowance my hon friend always do good job of not only represent harlow but remember the economic progress that be be make if anyone do not hear what he just say he talk about rise growth rise wage interest rate fall and country back on the path to success almost be pay out by dorset community foundation through its surviving winter campaign include to many in my constituency the foundation have notice that many more people be rely on oil and liquefy gas especially those in park home and rural area what be the minister do with cabinet colleague to push down the price of power for those who do not have choice the hon lady question give the opportunity to praise the work do by all kind of charity in some case through support pension credit uptake and in the case of well fund foundation provide direct support to pensioner that be all very welcome she be right to raise the wide question about source of energy but of course the winter fuel payment be cash benefit that can be use for all kind of energy the decision to restore the winter fuel payment to those earn under year be the right decision thank the minister and his predecessor for their constructive engagement with representation from my constituent in stockton billingham and norton on the threshold issue but do he agree with my constituent who write to to say that although welcome the winter fuel payment be not silver bullet and this government commitment to the triple lock stand in stark contrast to the previous conservative government break of that triple lock in which be still cost my constituent hundred of pound year absolutely agree with my hon friend and he be right to say that we should focus on the big change we be make to support pensioner which in england be rescue the nhs and raise the basic and the new state pension thank the minister for his statement very much welcome the decision to give the winter fuel payment back to pensioner raise the threshold to mean that many will now qualify and thank he for that on behalf of all of those pensioner who have struggle for the last month will they receive back pay from the government to pay off the credit card or the loan they have have to take out in order to make it through the last winter bear in mind that the cold weather over the last few week have mean people be still have to turn their heating on and rack up even more cost we have be make sure that there have be support over the course of the last winter and the hon gentleman will have see the increase in the state pension at the beginning of april include for many of his constituent the question for the northern ireland executive be how they wish to handle this but on the principle of parity we would say that the same change should take place in northern ireland so that his constituent receive the winter fuel payment this winter represent over pensioner in plymouth more than quarter of my constituent have have hundred of conversation over the past year and know that people understand that the winter fuel payment should not be give out to everyone in society the rich in society do not need it and warmly welcome the policy announce by the minister today what economic measure have this government take to allow we to make this change now thank my hon friend for his question we have go from compete over temperature to compete over volume of pensioner but both be important the point he make will echo with lot of member around the house who have have similar conversation with pensioner constituent who be on high income and who do not think it make sense for they to be receive hundred of pound from the government every year in future they will not be but the vast majority of pensioner over three quarter will be receive support this winter because of today decision do the minister agree that it be the strong economic foundation that this government have be build that have enable we to provide this extra support to pensioner and work people and that as the economy continue to grow we must focus ever more political attention and resource on the young generation particularly people start their career so that perhaps one day they may have triple lock my hon friend raise an important point which be that as economic growth return as it have over recent month what matter be that it feed through to rise living standard particularly for poor middle income household we need to be honest about this the reason why wage do not grow under the last government be that growth be not there that be exactly what we need to make sure never happen again my constituent be people of common sense and they tell that they do not think millionaire should get the winter fuel allowance but they do feel that the threshold be too low so they will no doubt welcome today announcement however after year of be let down by the conservatives they be wary of government announcement so can the minister reassure my constituent that support for pensioner by way of the triple lock pension credit and nhs investment will remain my hon friend be absolutely right to say that faith in the system have be strain by the failure of the last year economic failure public service failure and failure of basic behaviour in politic and that be what we need to turn around she can tell her constituent that wage be grow pension be rise waiting list be fall and britain be back that be the end of the statement will allow the front benchers moment to shuffle over planning and

line leave out subsection this amendment be consequential to amendments to it be real pleasure to bring this landmark bill back to the house on report let begin by thank hon member on both side of the chamber for their engagement with the bill over recent month in particular thank the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds for broxbourne lewis cocking for taunton and wellington gideon amos for didcot and wantage olly glover and for north herefordshire ellie chowns as well as hon friend on the government benches for their consider line by line scrutiny of the bill in committee over the past month the government have act decisively to restore economic stability increase investment and reform our economy to drive up productivity prosperity and living standard in every part of the country to build the home and critical infrastructure we need we have already deliver the most significant reform to our planning system in generation include the publication of revise pro growth national planning policy framework which the office for budget responsibility conclude will permanently increase the level of our real gdp by by the equivalent of billion in today price we be make further progress on our plan for change mission of rebuild britain and kickstarte economic growth this week by progress this critical legislation the planning and infrastructure bill will speed up and streamline the delivery of new home and critical infrastructure help we to achieve our ambitious milestone of build million safe and decent home in england and make planning decision on at least major economic infrastructure project in this parliament as well as support our clean power target by ensure that essential clean energy project be build as quickly as possible declare an interest as member of the ulster farmers union the mother body of which be the national farmers union other will comment on this but the ufu have tell that it be concerned about lose farmland for housing should it not be the policy of government to ensure that brownfield site be use first if they be use first farmer will have the opportunity to retain their land to produce food which be important do the minister feel there must be balance in what be put forward tonight to ensure that that happen thank the hon gentleman for that intervention he know have great affection for he he tempt into debate that do not directly relate to the bill but can tell he the following the government position be brownfield first when it come to development he know that we strengthen the national planning policy framework to give great weight to brownfield release we have consult on brownfield passport to ensure that bring forward previously develop land become the default and that people get yes in those circumstance when it come to agricultural land very strong protection already exist they remain in force in term of what be in the nppf will the minister give way will give way briefly and then will make some progress when the minister say that agricultural protection be very strong that simply be not true be it in the new nppf that the government bring in after be elect they remove the important clause that explicitly protect land use in food production slightly take issue with the hon member interpretation we make targeted change but the strong protection that apply to agricultural land exist he know that and have speak to he before about the fact that in particular part of the country we see high number of application for thing like solar farm but as have say to he before even under the most optimistic scenario less than of agricultural land will be bring forward for solar farm application and those protection remain in place so we be confident that that be robust will the minister give way will take this one last intervention because these be not matter relate to the bill and then want to move on this relate directly to the bill not only do it relate directly to the bill but there be dozen of amendment all relate to this one single issue the fact of the matter be that under the proposal as they stand we will lose vast swathe of prime agricultural land because planning consent will effectively be drive straight through that be simply not satisfactory do not know whether the right hon gentleman hear the point just make even under the most optimistic scenario less than of agricultural land will be turn over to solar farm use some of the hyperbole that have be associate with the issue over recent month be unwarranted say directly to he because want to move on and speak to the bill that these be matter that relate to the national planning policy framework rather than to any proposal in this piece of legislation be more than happy to sit down with he and talk about they outside of the context of this debate but do want to make some progress we make number of improvement to the bill in committee to ensure that it operate as intend and that its expected benefit be fully realise in many case the change be direct result of constructive feedback from key stakeholder and parliamentarian the result be the strong and more impactful bill before we will briefly outline the more substantive change make to the bill in committee include in relation to the nationally significant infrastructure project statutory consultee funding and the nature restoration fund before turn to further amendment that the government table last week thank the minister for the very open way in which he have approach this process so far he be absolutely right that the government make many positive change and concession in committee but he will be aware that many stakeholder remain concerned about the bill impact on nature as the bill progress be he minded to listen to representation from people who be absolutely behind he on his growth mission but who want to ensure that there be no further loss of natural habitat in one of the most nature deplete nation on the planet my hon friend and speak just day ago about that issue we be of course more than happy to continue engage with and listen to the view propose by hon member from across the house and by organisation if he will allow to make little progress will deal specifically with the nature restoration fund in fairly short order let begin with the improvement make to the consenting process for critical infrastructure as set out in my write ministerial statement of april the government have remove the overly prescriptive and burdensome statutory consultation requirement for major economic infrastructure project that be unique to the nsip system establish by the planning act over this parliament that change could result in cost saving of over billion across the project pipeline by speed up delivery increase capacity and reduce constraint cost it will also contribute to low household bill we have decide to proceed with the change because considerable evidence attest to the fact that the statutory requirement in place be drive perverse outcome rather than provide mean by which engagement drive well outcome statutory pre application procedure have become tick box exercise that encourage risk aversion and gold plating the result be consultation fatigue and confusion for community long more technical and less accessible documentation and an arrangement that actively disincentivise improvement to application even if they be in local community interest because applicant worry that further repeat consultation will be require in remove the statutory requirement to consult as part of the pre application stage for nsip application and bring requirement more closely in line with other planning regime the government be not downgrade the importance of high quality pre submission consultation and engagement we still want the nsip regime to function on the basis of front load approach in which development proposal be thoroughly scope and refine prior to be submit to the planning inspectorate and we still expect high quality early meaningful and constructive engagement and consultation to take place with those affect as part of that process give that such engagement and consultation routinely take place and lead to improve proposal in other planning regime without such statutory requirement and because the development consent order examination procedure reward high quality application we be confident that developer will continue to be incentivise to undertake it to support that change the government intend to publish statutory guidance set out strong expectation that developer undertake consultation and engagement prior to submit an application we will work with stakeholder to design that guidance public consultation will be launch in the come month so that it encourage good practice without recreate the flaw of the current system we have also make number of other change relate to the nationally significant infrastructure project regime include by amend the bill to ensure that promoter can gain access to land to carry out survey assess its condition and status and inform environmental impact assessment and to make the process for post consent change to development consent order more proportionate to the change request my inbox be full of correspondence from harlow resident who can not get home and can not get on the housing ladder they find that the planning framework mean that it take too long to get house build the main purpose of the bill be to speed up that process and build people the home that they need my hon friend be right the bill do streamline the delivery of new home and critical infrastructure although the change have just refer to relate not to home but the regime for nationally significant infrastructure project big clean energy project water reservoir and so forth there be other change in the bill that do support more streamlined local planning process before the minister move on will he give way be go to make some progress because know lot of hon member want to get in and there be lot of point need to make before can bring other in turn to other important change make to the bill in committee to support our grid connection queue reform we introduce small set of amendment to ensure that the relevant clause operate as intend and that they support we to move from first come first serve to first ready first need first connect approach to help address the lack of capacity and resource within statutory consultee we have introduce new sustainable funding model for the statutory consultee system the new surcharge that will be able to be apply to planning application fee will be use to fund body include statutory consultee that provide advice and ancillary support that enable good decision making alongside the localisation of planning fee provide for by clause the new surcharge will allow we to address capacity and resource issue and support fast and well quality decision make process finally we have make change to the nature restoration fund before detail the various improvement make let take this opportunity to remind the house why part of the bill be so important put simply when it come to development and nature the status quo be not work it be not work for development because constraint like the requirement for nutrient neutrality in sensitive river catchment be stifle the building of new home and infrastructure equally importantly it be not work for nature because the need to meet environmental obligation on the basis of site by site assessment and intervention all too often do little to drive the recovery and restoration of our protect site and specie be the minister not concerned that he have lose the audience among wildlife organisation and trust that say they be offend by minister portray nature as blocker to development rather than an enhancement to life and the economy and be now ask for part of the bill to be scrap will come on to address that call which know be be make but in general the bill aim for and have always focus on win win for development and the environment we have extremely productive engagement with engo in the development of the bill and we continue to have fruitful conversation with they aside from the campaign that know be be fight out there in the country and in some of the national medium while critic of this part of the bill may be content to maintain the suboptimal status quo in full knowledge of the fact that it be frustrate the building of new home and fail to drive the restoration of nature this government be not to those who believe this government might buckle and scrap part of the bill entirely simply say you have underestimate the resolve of this government and this minister the case for move to more strategic approach that will allow we to use funding from development to deliver environmental improvement at scale that will have the great impact in drive the recovery of protect site and specie be compelling that be why so many organisation indicate their in principle support for the purpose and intent of part when the bill be first introduce will the minister give way will make some progress as beccy speight the chief executive of rspb put it at the time with bold leadership collaboration and smart planning through initiative like the nature restoration fund we can build future where nature climate people and the economy thrive together welcome the enhanced environmental protection in the nature restoration fund my constituency of bournemouth west have some unique heathland habitat many of which be protect as site of special scientific interest they hold deep value for the local community so can the minister reassure that these unique habitat will be protect as well under this bill thank my hon friend for that intervention we must make distinction between irreplaceable habitat where the model do not remove the strong protection that exist for they such as ancient woodland in the national planning policy framework and habitat where natural england will be allow to take view as to whether conservation measure that apply to they meet the overall improvement test in the bill and any intervention in those circumstance will be drive by what be in the environmental good interest of the relevant feature there be therefore protection in place that address my hon friend concern in recent week there have be not inconsiderable amount of spurious commentary attempt to convey false impression of what the nature restoration fund do on that specific point will the minister give way if the hon lady will let develop my argument little be more than happy to give way to she in due course as such feel obliged to tackle number of the most flagrant misconception head on first some have claim that the nature restoration fund be drive by belief that development must come at the expense of the environment and that the government be create licence for developer to pay to pollute cash to trash model as some have dub it in reality the nature restoration fund will do the precise opposite have be consistently clear that build new home and critical infrastructure should not and need not come at the expense of the environment it be plainly nonsense to suggest that the nature restoration fund would allow developer simply to pay government and then wantonly harm nature instead it take payment from developer and hand they to natural england public body with regulatory duty to conserve and enhance our natural environment to develop environmental delivery plan set out how various conservation measure will not only address the impact of development but go far to demonstrate how they will improve the conservation status of the environmental feature the minister be make strong case for the legislation on which he have work very hard however do he accept that many concern be raise in committee on which we both serve about natural england ability to undertake the duty that he be ask it to undertake and that he be unable to give an answer about the extra funding that may be need for that to happen will he elaborate on that the shadow minister memory be different from mine do provide those assurance we have already allocate million in the budget to support the delivery of the nature restoration fund and through measure set out in the bill we will move to system of full cost recovery so that natural england have the resource it need to carry out those function rise know lot of members wish to contribute to the debate but will make some progress if may finish the argument be try develop about take on those misconception will give way to the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns very shortly we have be perfectly clear that the new approach be not means of make unacceptable development acceptable which be why the bill give natural england the ability to request planning condition to ensure that appropriate action be take by developer as part of use an edp thank the minister warmly for give way he dismiss spurious criticism of part of the bill but would he use that phrase to dismiss the very expert criticism of the office for environmental protection in complete contrast to the secretary of the state claim that the bill do not reduce environmental protection in its independent expert advice the oep say that it do and that the bill constitute regression in environmental protection the simple answer be no would not characterise the oep advice as spurious but be characterise some of the argument that have be make over recent day and week as such the oep be not say that the bill be cash to trash model but some people out there in the public discourse be make that claim rise will not give way again we have to make this argument to take on the critic of the bill who be intentionally try to malign the objective on that point will the minister give way will not have just be very clear that be not go to give way again as want to make some progress rise the hon member for north herefordshire be more than welcome to have another go at intervene in due course know that she will be put forward her view later the government view be that the bill be not regressive as have say environmental delivery plan will secure improve environmental outcome that go far than simply offset harm as require under current legislation as the hon lady know because we have extensive debate in committee we be give very serious consideration to the oep technical advice on how the bill might be strengthen in various area another claim that have be put forward have be that the bill strip protection from our protect site and specie allow for untrammelled development across the country again that amount to nothing less than wanton misrepresentation the very strong protection for important site set out in national planning policy be untouched by the legislation it be only when an edp be in place follow consultation and approval by the secretary of state that developer can avail themselves of it to discharge the relevant obligation in the same way that developer can build only once they have meet exist requirement development support by the nature restoration fund will only be able to come forward when there be credible and robust edp in place that will deliver well environmental outcome the chair of the environmental audit committee my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins have rightly flag the importance of these plan rely on robust scientific evidence which be why they will only ever be put in place where they can be show to deliver well environmental outcome finally there have be suggestion by some that the new approach provide for by the bill would allow for the destruction of irreplaceable habitat or for irrecoverable harm again that be patently false not only do all exist protection for irreplaceable habitat remain in place but the overall improvement test in clause simply could not be meet if an edp propose to allow irrecoverable harm natural england would not propose such measure and the secretary of state could not sign they off if it do if any secretary of state sign they off they would be open to judicial review on the basis of that decision in short the nature restoration fund will do exactly as its name suggest it will restore not harm nature it be smart planning reform design to unlock and accelerate housing and infrastructure delivery while improve the state of nature across the country by shift to strategic approach leverage economy of scale and reduce the need for costly project level assessment it will deliver win win for development and the environment while the government have no time for spurious and misleading attack on the nature restoration fund be acutely conscious of the view express both within and beyond this house from those who be supportive of the purpose and intent of part of the bill those who be not call for it to be scrap but be not yet convince that the safeguard within it be sufficiently robust or that there be the require certainty that it will deliver in practice the potential environmental benefit it offer find it remarkable that the minister repeatedly accuse the over lead environmental group include the royal society for the protection of birds which have describe the bill as cash to trash model as make spurious remark give that he quote the chief executive of the rspb beccy speight to try to shore up his own argument however the quote that he take be from much early comment make before the debate in committee more recently she have say the evidence clearly show nature be blocker to growth the government have identify the wrong obstacle to the problem it try to overcome she go on to say that with no possibility for improve the bill through amendment the complete removal of part of the bill be the only responsible option leave it be for the chief executive of the rspb to justify why she have change her view on the bill when the bill have not change if anything as will come on to explain quite lot of amendment that the government make order the list of member wish to speak be extensive so hope that the minister will be come to conclusion shortly be not plan to madam deputy speaker because need to set out some important change that the government have make and the amendment that we be propose however on the basis of your stricture will not take any further intervention the bill have not change if anything it have be strengthen in committee in way that will set out to assuage what be entirely reasonable question in respect of an approach that be novel we have already make some target improvement to part in committee include require environmental delivery plan to demonstrate how conservation measure will be maintain and over what period strengthen the overall improvement test by clarify that the secretary of state must be satisfied that it will be pass by the end date of the environmental delivery plan clarify that the negative effect the secretary of state must consider relate to the maximum amount of development cover by the environmental delivery plan and ensure that natural england have sufficient power of entry use only when absolutely necessary to survey or investigate land alongside appropriate constraint include notice requirement and introduce further protection in respect of natural england use of compulsory purchase power those change significantly strengthen the nature restoration fund and hope will be welcome across the house however as be at pain to make clear in committee and will more than happily restate once again today continue to reflect on the reasonable point make by hon member and the advice of the office for environmental protection with view to deliberate on what more might be do to ensure everyone be confident that the outcome for nature provide for by this part of the bill will be positive for the purpose of clarity that include give serious consideration to way in which we might instil further confidence in respect of the rigour of the overall improvement test provide for great certainty in respect of the delivery of edp and ensure that there be more clarity about the evidential basis and environmental rationale for strategic network level conservation measure as we do so put on record my thank to all those who have continue to engage constructively with the government with view to provide reassurance that the nature restoration fund will operate as intend as ever will listen carefully to the contribution make by hon member in respect of part of the bill and look forward to constructive debate on these clause in committee we discuss the need to do more to rapidly increase the coverage of swift brick across the country as an important mean of arrest the long term decline in breed swift population in respond to the debate intend to cover some of the way forward that the government intend to take before close must turn to number of substantive amendment that the government propose to the bill start with further change to the nsip regime we have already include an ambitious package of reform in the bill that will deliver fast and more certain consenting process for critical infrastructure as part of our mission to speed up the process overall it be critical that examination be focused and efficient and that examine authority continue to report to the secretary of state within the regime statutory timeframe follow feedback from stakeholder and review of recent examination we be make an amendment with view to reinforce good practice in examination already adopt by some examine authority at the start of the examination process the examine authority be require to make an initial assessment of the principal issue an iapi for each application which will detail the key matter specific to an application although the planning act require that an initial assessment of the principal issue be make at the start of the examination there be no requirement for it to be use for or to influence anything in the subsequent examination process we believe that that initial assessment stage could be work hard to set the foundation for effective and streamlined examination that be why we be amend the bill to ensure that the initial assessment of principal issue be meaningful step that ensure that more focused examination can occur through the amendment examine authority will be require to make procedural decision about how they intend to examine an application in the light of the iapi that will support their ability to ensure that examination be focus with time prioritise on the issue that be most critical to the project as set out in the iapi the change will also give more certainty up front to all those involve in examination so that they have more clarity about what to expect during the examination process turn to an important propose change relate to transport infrastructure as hon member will be aware the bill contain important reform to the highways act and the transport and works act that will streamline and improve the efficiency of deliver road infrastructure scheme and ensure that process within the regime in the act be fit for purpose and proportionate deliver fast and more certain consenting process for transport infrastructure project build connectivity and tackle congestion and overcrowding follow engagement with the department for transport and the welsh government we be make small number of technical amendment to these reform the amendment clarify beyond doubt that the responsibility for consent marine licence in welsh offshore area remain with the welsh ministers they also ensure that part of clause do not apply to instrument make by welsh ministers under the highways act that demonstrate our commitment to devolution and to work with all party constructively to achieve mutually beneficial outcome finally we propose two further technical change to the nature restoration fund the provision in part of the bill have always allow for the nature restoration fund to operate in english water out to nautical mile however give the different regulatory requirement and protect site at sea we be make amendment to ensure the effective operation of the nature restoration fund in the marine environment in particular to enable marine licensable activity in english water out to nautical mile to be cover by an environment delivery plan to support the development of new harbour and port in line with the provision for terrestrial edp any such plan in the marine space will need to take into account the relevant marine plan marine policy statement and uk marine strategy as appropriate that will ensure that edp support the government marine priority in bring forward the nature restoration fund it be also necessary to ensure that the provision work effectively to support development deliver through different consenting regime to achieve that we be make amendment relate to the harbours act and the marine and coastal access act that will ensure that the strategic benefit of environmental delivery plan can help to unlock the delivery of transport project and well support nature recovery in those area reiterate that we will continue to consider whether element of the new nature restoration fund model could be strengthen to give great confidence that positive environmental outcome will be achieve look forward to continue to engage with stakeholder and parliamentarian on this important issue commend the government amendment to the house thank hon member for their effort to improve the bill and for the scrutiny and challenge that the bill have receive so far and look forward to listen to the remainder of the debate call the shadow minister think just speak once at the end you just wish to speak at the end marvellous interruption actually will say few word why resist the temptation to say few thing thank the minister for his hard work in lead the planning and infrastructure public bill committee and all member who serve on that committee over the past few week he spend long time in committee say that he would reflect on number of really important point that hon member across the political divide have make but he have do no such thing he say that he have reflect and that he will also reflect after the event of today and tomorrow but he have make no substantive change to the bill base on the real and genuine environmental concern of many member across the house do not intend to detain the house too long because know that have wind up speech but we be worried about the centralising zeal of this government when it come to planning as say on second reading we be worried about the erosion of the power of locally elect democratic politician to make decision about their local area serve their local people agree with the hon gentleman that local community should have much more control over what happen to the housing stock in their area will he reflect on his party opposition so far to the proposal from the liberal democrats for different category of planning use for both short term let and second home give that community such as mine be ravage by so many home be unavailable to local people will he change his party position and show that if the minister be not listen he be the conservative party have always believe in the right of locally elect councillor and plan committee to make decision for the people they serve we have say that consistently through the passage of this bill the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos have table new clause to ensure that planning committee have their current power reinstate under the government proposal the minister be say this afternoon as he will say tomorrow that he do not trust any planning committee or any labour control council to make decision base on the wish of the constituent in their local area we think that that be disgrace do my hon friend agree that our constituent expect to have their voice hear on local planning committee provide that council be well train the system that we have be work quite well oh be it the hon gentleman say be it from sedentary position but absolutely agree with my right hon friend very few planning application be refuse by plan committee and very few planning application do not go through because of the action of plan committee we on the opposition benches happen to trust our locally elect councillor and local leader to make decision for our constituent it be quite clear that government member do not trust they as they be vest more power into the hand of the minister and the secretary of state obviously the hon gentleman be member of the party that be in power for the last year the result of that year period be that we be nation with housing crisis and huge number of people in inadequate accommodation or no accommodation at all and that we be the most nature deplete nation on earth so the system clearly be not work do he have any real sense that there need to be change or be he say that we can carry on with the system that we have would have more truck with the hon gentleman argument if anything that his government propose have the intention that he have outline just this morning savills have indicate know what the propose legislation will do that the target of million home will not be meet and that only house will be build by the end of this parliament when it come to the environmental protection that the minister have outline it be quite clear that many of the concern of member across this house should be listen to the environmental proposal make by the minister will have detrimental impact on local area by ship the problem elsewhere do the hon member have any proposal the hon gentleman ask whether have any proposal the last government build the large number of house in history there be many thing that we agree need to be do and there be some area of this bill that we agree with but the hon gentleman need to realise that take power away from locally elect councillor be disgrace the minister be say to the hon gentleman and his councillor that they should not be trust to make decision on behalf of their local community be sure he will not be happy with that when he get to his annual general meeting in few month time to be reselecte as parliamentary candidate there be other concern about this legislation as we have say the government have consistently say that they want to build million home but the independent office for budget responsibility body that labour hold in high regard when it be in opposition have forecast that the government will fail to deliver on their manifesto commitment and will fall short of that figure as have say that be echo today by savills which estimate that the government will build just over half the number of house that the deputy prime minister have promise even after come out of her very testing meeting with the chancellor the government proposal to reduce the number of legal challenge available to opponent of major infrastructure development from three to two and in some case just one should alarm anyone who believe in check and balance legal scrutiny be not an inconvenience it be the backbone of our democratic system infrastructure project often have far reach environmental social and economic consequence and by curtail legal recourse we be not remove red tape but remove the public right to hold power to account in the name of speed the government be undermine the legal mechanism that protect we from government overreach as have say the clear implication of the minister proposal today be that power will be remove from locally elect plan committee that be disgrace and it be in addition to gerrymandering housing algorithm that punish rural area and reward labour councillor in urban centre for failure we be tell that the bill will speed up planning decision but at what cost local planning authority be indeed struggle under resource and overburden but grant they fee raise power without guarantee central support be like ask drown man to swim hard more alarmingly the shift of decision make power from elect councillor to unelected planning officer under the guise of efficiency diminish local democracy it take key decision out of the hand of public representative and place they in the hand of bureaucracy increasingly dictate by central policy we be also tell that the bill will make plan more strategic that be noble aim but let we not forget that the strategic failure of recent year have be due not to too much local input but to too little co ordination the requirement for regional spatial strategy be scrap by this government predecessor now the pendulum swing once again with combined authority be tell to draft regional plan however those same authority be be starve of the funding and staff require to do so we risk repeat history only this time with few safety net and weakened capacity to challenge flawed strategy chair the all party parliamentary group on flooding and flooded community which be concerned that there be million property currently at risk of flooding figure that be forecast to rise to million by because of climate change however the bill do not really address climate change or any kind of flood resilience will the hon gentleman join in urge the minister to consider the amendment table by and other that deal with building property in area that be at risk of flooding and lack flood resilience of course we discuss this topic at great length in committee and many good amendment be table however as understand it and as think the hon lady agree have reflect consistently the minister have not strengthen the environmental protection or the measure to deal with flood risk to housing that will be build in future in fact would argue that those protection have be weaken hope the minister will go away and look at these issue again turn to environmental protection we in the conservative party say that they be under threat the creation of environmental delivery plan sound suitably wishy washy but this new centralised model turn bespoke ecological assessment into bureaucratic chequebook exercise while developer may cheer the ability to pay into nature restoration fund instead of take direct responsibility for mitigation we should ask whether this be really restoration or whether it be greenwashe on natural england remind the minister once again that the bill committee hold huge evidence session he consistently say that he have confidence in natural england ability to undertake the responsibility he be seek to impose on it but time and time again he have outline that he have allocate what would argue be mediocre sum of money to natural england he be ask that organisation to make decision and improve environmental protection for people across this country but he still have not outline what funding model will be in place the chief executive of natural england herself state in very generic term that she be not entirely sure that she or her organisation would be able to undertake those operation go forward the minister should listen to the huge concern across this house that natural england be not the right organisation to undertake those responsibility rather it should be local council and local mayor they should be the one who represent their constituent and speak for local people and who can make the change they need on environmental protection the conservative party have table two amendment that hope rather fruitlessly suspect the minister will look kindly on he do not look favourably on many opposition amendment in committee he say that he have strengthen the bill but that be just through labour amendment however hope that he will look seriously at new clause and table by my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds new clause would prohibit solar power development on high quality agricultural land that be vital safeguard for the future of british farming and national food security at time when global food supply chain be increasingly fragile it be essential that we protect our most productive agricultural land from irreversible development this clause will ensure that the uk good farmland be preserve for grow food which be what it be intend for rather than be cover in solar panel the clause do not oppose renewable energy rather it call for smart more balanced approach that direct solar project to brownfield site rooftop and low grade land so that we do not undermine our capacity to feed ourselves do the hon member recognise that only up to of agricultural land could actually be dedicate to solar panel do he also recognise that former president of the national farmers union have say that solar help farmer to generate income the hon gentleman say only up to but give the international situation this country should be produce its own food and that land should be protect he may need to catch up because understand that the nfu now want the bill to go far and completely ban solar panel on high quality land suggest that he speak to the nfu again and then come back to this house and back new clause the nfu speak up for our farmer so we should listen if it be not happy with what be in the bill instead of give quote from former nfu employee the hon gentleman should listen to the nfu current leadership and then maybe change his comment do the hon member believe that farmer be able to choose how good to use their land of course believe that farmer know how to make good use of their land but this government be take power away from farmer whether by increase the power to issue compulsory purchase order for land that farmer want to use to produce food or by reduce the money that they will get from the cpo that the government be advocate for farmer see more and more agricultural land be take out of use suggest that the hon gentleman read the bill and the measure that the minister be bring forward which undermine our farmer and stop they from be able to do the job that they want to do will the hon member give way will move on to another clause because madam deputy speaker probably want to sit down soon as might many other member hon member hear hear know would get universal acclaim eventually new clause be also table by my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner village across our country need to be protect and the bill simply do not do that it eradicate the relevance of local plan and power of local people to make decision to protect the strategic gap around our village hope that the minister will look favourably on the new clause which would provide village with protection equivalent to those provide to town under the national planning policy framework it be vital measure for protect the character identity and heritage of england village before they be lose to unchecked sprawl for too long plan policy have prioritise urban growth without give equal attention to the unique pressure face by rural community new clause seek to correct that imbalance by require the secretary of state to issue or update guidance that grant village equivalent protection to those afford to town under the nppf in order to safeguard village from be swallow up by neighbouring development preserve green buffer between settlement and protect the historic fabric and rural character that define these community thank my hon friend the member for castle point rebecca harris for her work in bring about the amendment follow truly baffle plan appeal decision on green belt in her constituency that decision would result in the merging of two settlement with completely different character and identity simply because one be class as village and one be class as town many member will have have such problem the minister need to go away and look at the protection of village and green belt in the bill because it be not deliver that number of amendment have be table that opposition member think would make the bill well new clause table by the hon member for bournemouth east tom hayes relate to play area many development be not deliver with play area and those should be bring forward amendment table by the hon member for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff would require environmental delivery plan to set out timetable for and to report on conservation measure and it would require improvement of the conservation status of specified feature before development take place we opposition member believe that there need to be change to planning policy but the minister have squander chance he have not listen to member who genuinely want to strengthen the bill by make planning policy fast while protect our environment and enhance the role of our locally elect councillor as result he have leave we unable to strengthen the bill by work together this be waste opportunity he will not deliver his housing number he will take power away from local community and stifle the planning process we opposition members will always stand up for our locally elect councillor it be shame that this government simply have not do that rise more than back benchers hope to contribute and colleague know what time this debate have to end it be unlikely that everybody will get in so colleague may want to reconsider and submit to speak tomorrow instead of today call the chair of the select committee be mindful of what you say madam deputy speaker and will try to keep my remark short rise to speak to the amendment in my name in this report stage will briefly touch on why the bill be so vital it be fair to say that we all as constituency mps have our frustration with the planning system but ultimately we must remember why this bill matter we be in the middle of housing crisis generation of young people be spend more and more of their income on unaffordable private rent while the dream of home ownership fade even far we have million household on local authority waiting list for social housing and more than child grow up in temporary accommodation that figure have rise by in the last year alone be the chair of the housing communities and local government committee and our first report look at the life of some of the child in temporary accommodation what we find be truly shameful family be live in damp cold and mouse infest home baby be not able to crawl or learn to walk because of lack of floor space most shockingly we find that temporary accommodation have be contribute factor in the death of at least child in the past five year as fellow london member of parliament recognise everything that my hon friend have describe be she surprised as be to hear from the shadow minister that the planning system be fine and should not change as outline in my opening comment the planning system do not work it be break just as we have broken housing market and housing crisis mention the child who die in the past five year be under the age of one as member of parliament represent different part of the country we might disagree with aspect of development in our constituency and we must not let developer off the hook when they often fail to deliver quality in new housing my hon friend be make powerful speech and she touch on developer my new clause focus on developer obligation when they have commit at the planning application stage to deliver certain number of affordable home under my new clause they would have to stick to that they should not be give scope to use issue around viability or profitability to reduce the number of affordable home that they deliver do she agree that that option should not be open to developer if they want to build home thank my constituency neighbour for that important point we have to be honest the market face developer be challenging their cost have increase but we see waiting list across our borough increase daily more and more people face an acute housing shortage it be therefore important that when developer consult and go to plan committee with their development plan they stick to what they have commit to developer must build the infrastructure that our community need and we must ensure that home be build to the high safety standard we must be in no doubt that unacceptably we have for decade fail to build the home that we need if we want to give young people home stop family face the scourge of homelessness and ensure that every child have the good start in life we must say yes to build more home in particular not enough new social home have be build that be why table new clause completely agree that not enough social home be be build do the hon lady think we should have target for social home in the bill thank the hon member for that point and be come to some of the point on target essentially this subject be why table new clause and be grateful for the support of colleague from all part of the house social rent as we know be the most affordable housing tenure as the rent be calculate through national formula usually the rent be set at around of local market rent that be exactly the kind of housing we need if we want to make progress towards end homelessness during this parliament the minister tell the select committee that the government want to prioritise the building of new social rent home as part of their social housing ambition my new clause would require the government to set national target for the number of social rent home that they want to deliver per year the target would not be bind on the government or the sector but it would demonstrate the scale of the government ambition target be important to how our planning system work in england local and national housing target make sure that our planner developer and housing association know how many home the government intend to deliver and they allow community to plan effectively the government have be clear on their overall national housing target but the select committee believe that the government must set out how they intend to hit that million target and we want to ensure that include target by tenure in the absence of specific housing target the number of new social rent home have plummet from hundred of thousand in the to consistently below in the past decade my hon friend be make powerful point which we have discuss on the select committee do she agree that to reach the target of social home year we must set clear target now otherwise we will not be able to get grip on the housing crisis when it come to deliver socially rent home thank my fellow committee member for make that point as the shadow minister outline number of key sector have make claim and be worried about the target that the government have set it be an ambitious target and we want the government to hit it but without urgent action that might be difficult for they to do in the absence of such target far few family be get off the waiting list out of homelessness and into secure and safe affordable home as the new select committee have not endorse specific number of social rent home my new clause do not hold the government to target rather we want the government to consider what be need and most important what be possible within the financial constraint and the sector capacity in recent year several organisation have call for social rent target at different level as we have just hear from my hon friend the member for gillingham and rainham naushabah khan the most common figure be social rent home per year which have be endorse by shelter crisis the national housing federation the affordable housing commission and the predecessor of my committee in the last parliament the hon member have make some excellent point about the need to set target for social home believe that the destruction of council house stock be one of the most regressive action that the country have ever take and that we need to replenish that stock as matter of urgency however fear that year be not enough do she agree that we need to aim for the hon member make really important point what we be ask the government to do in the new clause and what many other member across the house be ask they to do be ensure that within that million target there be clear ambition in relation to how many of those home will be social housing we need to take step first before we start increase that target but agree that be drop in the ocean give the number of people across the country who be on the social housing waiting list when he be in office the former secretary of state now lord gove say that he want to see at least social rent home year which he call stretching but achievable target my new clause would give the government six month after the passing of the bill to set their own target by that time we expect the government to have publish detail of new affordable home programme and long term housing strategy the minister have tell the select committee that the long term housing strategy will set out how the government will meet their million target and we hope that will include breakdown of the figure by tenure and target for social rent housing my amendment and be technical amendment to the bill planning fee ringfence we know that local planning authority be badly under resource accord to the royal town planning institute one quarter of planner have leave the public sector between and the sector have therefore welcome the bill plan to ringfence the revenue from planning fee so that local authority must invest those revenue in planning department however in evidence to the committee plan representative tell we that the current ringfence in the bill be too restrictive as it would not allow planning department to spend the money on develop their local plan the minister be up to date with local plan and as he know local plan coverage be vital if the government planning reform be to succeed the fact be however that only third of local authority have an up to date local plan in place it therefore seem to be miss opportunity that the ringfence as currently draft would not allow local authority to invest in plan make use revenue from fee the government wish to see universal coverage of local plan so hope that the minister might consider make this modest change in the other place to extend the fee ringfence with those local plan in place and with the government wide planning reform bed in hopefully we will start to see real progress towards build the home we so desperately need but even then we must face the reality that plan reform alone will not to be enough to deliver million home during the current parliament the private sector will need to take time to adjust to the new regime and developer will need year of lead in time to bring forward those application the private sector will build home only at the rate at which they sell without need to reduce price whereas with social housing family can receive the key to secure home as soon as it be build we must remember that the last time england be build home year more than of they be social housing the government have promise to deliver the big wave of social and affordable housing for generation and that will require the big boost in social housing investment for generation in truth the spending review will make or break the million target it be now time for the government to be bold and to deliver on their housing ambition if they do so they will find council across the country ready to match their ambition particularly welcome southwark council work and the work of its outgoing leader councillor kieron williams in spearhead the secure the future of council housing campaign in just under year southwark have join other council across england in send the clear message that it be there to get more home deliver and to fix the broken housing system urge the government to match that goal back up their stated ambition and set social housing target follow the spending review we must ensure that social rent housing the most affordable tenure form substantial part of the new housing that result from the bill rise order may remind member that we be push for time after the next front bench speech shall be impose an immediate five minute time limit now call the liberal democrat spokesperson let start by thank all the member of the bill committee the clerks and the official whose joy at receive our amendment can only imagine to have be unbounded the house will be pleased to hear that will now be focus only on those that we have prioritise for this debate on second reading the liberal democrats and plaid cymru be the only party to vote against the bill all the other be content to support it labour and green party member nod it through while the conservatives the official opposition abstain hope that they will all consider their position more seriously on this occasion and reconsider support some of the measure in the bill but if today the liberal democrats be again the only party to vote against the bill tomorrow tomorrow as the hon gentleman have remind if tomorrow the liberal democrats be the only party to vote against the bill because of the harm that it do to the right of community and local people to fairness and to nature all three of which be cornerstone of what liberal believe in we shall bear that standard proudly and we shall do so again have table new clause which would require housing development application to include provision for green space within minute of new home support nature and help people to lead happy healthy life do my hon friend agree that the government have miss an opportunity to require new housing development to be design in way that would be not only good for nature and the environment but good for the health and wellbeing of resident agree with my hon friend who be great champion of green space in development in our contribution we be show how the protection of nature could be strengthen in the bill without entire chunk of it be delete shall say more about that later as we hear from the chair of the select committee the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi when it come to right for individual real freedom often depend on decent home that people can afford and where they can bring up their family when home be genuinely affordable for local people they will command real community consent and support in the planning process unless we give commitment to massive increase in the number of social and council rent home we will not be respond to the need of those people and we will fail to meet head on the criticism that housing development today be more about profit than about people my constituency contain less than the national average proportion of social rent housing at do my hon friend agree that it be shocking that the new government have be asleep at the wheel and have lack the ambition to deal with the desperate need for more social rent housing during their first month in power thank my hon friend for champion the need for social and council rent home which be exactly what the liberal democrats be do we welcome the billion commitment that the government have make to social housing and we be listen carefully to what they be say about the spending review but there be still no target for new social home in either this bill or any of the relevant government policy that absence need to be put right we agree with many of the amendment that the hon gentleman party have put forward he outline target for new social home how would he afford that and where would the money come from the hon gentleman lead on to the next part of my speech our amendment which would support the delivery of new social home per year would be fund by the taxation proposal set out in our costed manifesto that would provide an extra billion per year on top of the exist affordable housing programme and section contribution accord to the centre for economics and business research that would be enough to enable we to deliver social home per year by the end of the parliament on the right of community more people engage with their local council on planning than on almost any other area but far too often that engagement become dawn recognition that all the key power and lever on planning have be take away from local area by successive government leave local community and the elect councillor who represent they increasingly powerless over the development that take place around they housing number be set by formula make in whitehall and dictate not by population but by demand and supply ratio even though study show that that have never yet reduce the price of single house private builder will quite reasonably act to sustain the price of their product and add consent in this context be only likely to unleash development in inappropriate area do my hon friend agree that we see in the recent westminster hall debate that the standard method for calculate the number of home not only do not reduce price but inevitably ratchet they up and increase they my hon friend be very perceptive and hard work on this issue he raise significant problem with the current standard method and pay tribute to he it be not just the standard method that be dictate from whitehall so too be rule on second home and short term let so community can not stem the loss of family home for local people something that our new clause would put right rule on transport and highway capacity be also set by whitehall so local authority such as my own cheddon fitzpaine parish council can not question they in the battle between underfunded local authority and developer with big profit to make whitehall rule also mean that commitment to deliver affordable housing and infrastructure can all too often be evade on ground of viability something that our new clause would tackle by require an absolute minimum of social housing in any development no wonder trust in local politic be at such low that have only be make bad by the chaos of the previous conservative government with one rule for they and another for everyone else basic fairness go out the window the uk may rightly be rank among the top country in the world by transparency international but nothing undermine fairness more than foul play even if it be as we know very rare our new clause would ensure that never again can ministers favour planning application from donor without that be expose in the public record it can not ever be right for planning decision to be take by those who will financially benefit from it trust in the fairness of local democracy be so often shape by how much trust people have in the local planning process our amendment would remove from this bill the power it give whitehall to control the running of council and the right of councillor to make decision on planning application the power in this bill mean that for the first time even unanimous decision by every single councillor will not be enough to enable they to change decision that their officer or planning consultant make on their behalf give employee and consultant power over the head of the elect representative who employ they be dangerous step and no parliament should endorse it it be not just elect councillor who will lose their vote on planning member of this house will lose their vote when it come to change to national policy statement that set the rule for the large national infrastructure project from hinkley and swansea tidal lagoon to the world big offshore and onshore wind and solar farm our amendment would allow the government to change national policy statement to reflect change in the law but it would preserve this house right to decide whether national policy on massive project should be change people be not the problem ordinary people be not blocker and they should not be sweep out of the way as have say they and we want to see new home and development but these particular change which so damage right and trust in damage system will not deliver any significant growth or development because council planning committee already approve over of the planning application that come before they lib dem run somerset council have consent to thousand of new home and be build hundred of new council house include for the first time in generation in part of the county and it want to build more just as people and community should have right we need to stand up for the right of nature people want to see our river and waterway clean up and our environment protect river such as the tone in taunton where community by achieve new designation have uncover poor water quality and desperate need for investment precious chalk stream across the country have no protection at all and our amendment would give they the protection they require people want to see development that tread lightly on the land and reduce harmful emission agree with some of the thing that the hon member be say but we all want to build fast under the local district plan in stroud we have be wait four year for our housing plan and this bill will free we from the quagmire that be our current planning system last friday meet representative of the gloucestershire wildlife trust and the severn rivers trust who have serious concern about part of the bill do the hon member agree that we should have short pause on part and keep some of it certainly agree that part require amend our amendment seek to do that as will come to shortly people want to see development that tread lightly on the land and reduce harmful emission our new clause would enforce the zero carbon standard for all new home on which the liberal democrats and labour ministers work so hard before the conservatives cancel the whole zero carbon home programme in net zero standard cut bill as well as carbon emission so do my hon friend share my incredulity that government who have be force to turn on winter fuel payment be refuse to back new clause which would cut bill for people of all age it be absolutely right to say that we should be move to zero carbon home in fact one study show that have they be introduce in new homeowner would have save billion our new clause table by my hon friend the member for chichester jess brown fuller would give key national landscape partnership such as in the mellow and beautiful blackdown hill in my constituency seat at the planning table as we see specie become extinct before our eye people want to see new home and nature thrive together crucially our new clause would put back the pre eminent principle in all this wherever possible we must first do no harm to the environment on the site that be be impact of course there be circumstance such as phosphate mitigation where off site measure can deal with the problem but by completely remove from edp the hierarchy of mitigate impact first and foremost on site the bill provide what the national trust have call licence to kill nature do the hon member agree that the problem with the bill be misdiagnosis the problem be not nature hold up house building or local authority which have be starve of cash for the last year hold up housing but developer that be sit on million home with planning permission because they be land banking and profiteering that be the problem that the bill be not get to we do not have to destroy nature and we do not have to undermine our future environmental protection the hon gentleman be absolutely right to draw attention to the thousand of home that have plan permission and have not be build include the we have in somerset while welcome what the government have say about bring those forward real use it or lose it power be miss from the bill the liberal democrats have table new clause so that unless those home be build the local authority would have power to take over the land and to build the house that would ensure real use it or lose it penalty for those that do not build out the permission that they have pit community and nature as the enemy of progress and development would be massive mistake take power away from councillor be take it away from local people and take power away from member of parliament be take it from the hand of the people who elect we to this place both be example of centralisation and whitehall know good thinking in which local view count for little and nature for even less there be another way to build the hundred of thousand of home we need it be to invest in social home per year to pump prime our industry give community the funding for the job transport green space and energy infrastructure that our constituent want build the new gp and healthcare facility before build the house and home our community will need and build they in way that will support rather than harm those community be grateful to my hon friend for give way particularly as it sound as though he be come to his conclusion but want to give he the well possible chance to talk about new clause my constituency of surrey heath be make up of small village divide by green belt land and ministry of defence property without the protection afford by new clause fear that the distinctiveness and sense of place of those village will be gradually lose can he comment on how new clause would protect the distinctiveness of place be grateful to my hon friend for the point he make it be vital to protect the character of exist place and community that be so value which be why we want more locally drive approach to assess housing number and local plan make finally if we build the gp surgery the healthcare and the other infrastructure before the home we will be build in the interest of our community not against they that be the kind of community lead development that liberal democrats want and that our amendment would help to bring about and humbly urge member to support they rise to set out the case for amendment and and new clause in my name be very pleased to hear what the minister have say so far the bill would tackle the long stand conundrum of how to deliver the ambitious house building target to which the government be rightly commit while protect the environment and enhance not reduce protection for nature before turn to my amendment want to speak briefly about the extent to which the bill achieve those aim absolutely share the government commitment to free up the planning system and ensure that few people be unable to get on to the housing ladder and few child grow up in unsuitable overcrowded and temporary accommodation see the impact of this country failure to build the home it need in my surgery every single week so support the government aim to speed up that process also agree that planning have too often be barrier to those ambition and the government be absolutely right to attempt to remove this blocker freeing up unnecessary restriction however must not mean allow further nature degradation nor do it have to the government have say that these ambition will be achieve alongside nature recovery wildlife population in england have fall to around of their level as say few moment ago britain be now one of the most nature deplete place on earth most of england rare and vulnerable habitat be in poor condition alongside build the home and infrastructure that our society need we must rebuild our natural capital the air water soil and biodiversity on which our society depend it sound as though the hon member like have deep passion for ensure that we maintain nature so do he agree that simple measure would be to accept new clause which would extend permit development right for pond of up to hectare provide vital freshwater habitat for up to two third of all freshwater specie exactly as he have be say thank the hon member very much for that intervention and look forward to hear her speech in support of her new clause do think that have merit and be worth consider and look forward to hear she make her case in more detail the environmental audit committee which chair initiate an inquiry into housing growth and environmental sustainability to scrutinise the government national planning policy proposal achieve growth and deliver for people climate and nature together be vital but challenging task there be many provision in this bill that welcome and thank the minister for his effort and his detailed engagement be grateful that he make time to meet recently to discuss my propose amendment overall support the government intention in part and think those party that wish to simply scrap the approach entirely be wrong it be right to introduce more strategic approach to satisfy developer environmental obligation if do well the environmental delivery plan and the nature restoration levy propose in part could simplify and accelerate the process of meet exist environmental requirement where development impact protect site or protect specie importantly see the merit of this strategic approach in deliver large scale and more effective nature conservation measure where development have unavoidable impact on protect site and protect specie however the strength of concern from knowledgeable stakeholder should give the government serious pause for thought the office for environmental protection which be mention early publish advice for the government state that the exist provision in the bill would amount to regression in environmental law so it be welcome that the minister continue to be open minded about make further amendment look forward to hear about the engagement in another place where be certain that further amendment will be bring forward the environmental audit committee have hear evidence that there must be strong safeguard for the propose nature restoration fund to genuinely deliver on its potential for nature my objective in table amendment to this bill be to engage constructively with the government approach to part and to strengthen it so that it deliver for nature and development at the same time to turn first to amendment very much welcome what the minister have to say about scientific safeguard and look forward to what he come forward with this amendment would ensure that environmental delivery plan be use only where there be scientific evidence that they will work in other word there must be robust evidence that particular negative effect on protect site or protect specie can be mitigate or compensate for at strategic level rather than on site by site basis although the strategic approach that will be deliver by edp can work well for some habitat and specie such as nutrient or newts they do not always work for other this amendment would safeguard against the edp approach be apply to inappropriate specie or habitat the government have recognise this principle and have commit to modular approach to expand edp with new plan apply feature by feature and exist protection remain in place for those not yet cover support this approach and encourage the government to enshrine this principle in legislation to give certainty that the scientific safeguard to which they have commit can not be alter by any future government without revisit this legislation on amendment order in view of the pressure on time will limit my remark to amendment in my name the bill as we have hear seek to do many thing but one of they be to accelerate the roll out of electric vehicle charge point around the country to facilitate the move to electric vehicle driver with disability and there be million of they will also be expect to move to electric vehicle but public charging point be often unsuitable for they to use the amendment be design to address that there be british standards institution standard pas which set out minimum standard by which charge point operator can ensure that electric vehicle driver with accessibility need be able to use public charging infrastructure both reliably and safely it be develop in conjunction with the motability foundation and the government and be publish in october it address common accessibility concern such as the placement of charge point minimum bay size and the height and weight of the charge cable the problem be that the standard be not mandatory and thus far nobody can find single public charging point that meet that standard that be fundamental question of equality which become more acute as the charge network become more extensive even without the additional impetus that the bill be intend to provide new charger be currently be instal every minute ensure those charger be accessible to people with disability be therefore both urgent and sensible not least because retrofit accessibility on to an already instal network will be much more expensive the amendment would ensure that if voluntary compliance with pas do not improve the government have power to enforce compliance progressively it would also allow local authority to monitor that compliance and oblige charge point operator to collect and report datum on the compatibility of individual charge point with key accessibility benchmark it do that by add to the regulation make power in the automated and electric vehicles act which currently seek to ensure that the charge network operate to the benefit of consumer with regard to acceptable method of payment maintenance and compatibility with different type of electric vehicle it be surely logical to add accessibility for people with disability to that list and to do so now while we have relatively rare legislative opportunity want to take the opportunity to thank the electric vehicle association england the motability foundation and other organisation for their work on these proposal and their support for they hope the government and the minister will look favourably on these relatively modest change which argue could have big impact on the ability of driver with disability to use the charge network that we be ask all motorist to use and which can therefore ensure we all make the journey to electric motoring together rise to speak in support of amendment and in my name declare an interest as the co chair of the local nature recovery all party parliamentary group and proud specie champion for the hen harrier be deeply committed to the protection and restoration of our natural world and have table the amendment to ensure there be adequate protection for protect specie recognise the need to take the housing crisis extremely seriously support numerous amendment on affordable home and social housing include new clause table by my hon friend the member for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff which would mandate that national and local housing plan incorporate and justify specific target for both affordable and social housing it be clear that we need to build more housing but we must ensure that that include enough social home because just society must care for both people and planet in defence of nature we must remember that nature be not luxury it be essential it sustain our health our economy our climate and the rich web of wildlife that make our planet thrive from the air we breathe to the food we eat and the water we drink nature underpin every aspect of our survival yet we be as have be say live in one of the most nature deplete country in the world and the consequence be become impossible to ignore our peatland woodland wetland and sea once vibrant with life be deteriorate these ecosystem be not just carbon store they be vital habitat for countless specie as they degrade they not only release more carbon than they absorb but drive wildlife into decline iconic specie be vanish pollinator be disappear and once common bird and mammal be become rare push many specie close to extinction without urgent action to restore these ecosystem we can not hope to meet our climate goal or halt the alarming loss of biodiversity every specie lose weaken the resilience of nature and our ability to adapt to change climate protect nature be not just an environmental imperative it be an economic social and moral one the loss of pollinator threaten our food supply the destruction of our coastal habitat increase our vulnerability to storm and flooding and the collapse of ecosystem put both human and animal live at risk my amendment require that if protect species be identify as an environmental feature the environmental delivery plan must include clear strategy for conservation measure to address the impact of the development on that specie within local recovery strategy area if natural england determine that that be not possible or there be an override public interest not to do that it must aim to conserve the same specie at different site recognise the realistic risk of local extinction and the threat face specific specie this approach reflect fundamental truth protect nature be not optional it be essential our ecosystem be interconnect and the loss of even single specie can have cascade effect on biodiversity climate resilience and human wellbeing by embed strong enforceable protection for specie into development planning we be not only safeguard wildlife but reinforce the natural system that sustain our economy our health and importantly our future give the really important point that the hon lady be make about the environment and how it be so strongly connect to our economy and public health do she agree with appreciate that this be on slight tangent but she will see where it be go that the planning rule for big digital billboard which themselves can emit home worth of energy not to mention the light pollution that seriously affect nature and human health be illogical and inconsistent the rule say that planning application can only be consider on highway safety and immunity ground and not on environmental impact or on the impact on human health would it not be well if local authority could make decision on those ground as well the hon lady make an interesting point and be sure the minister be listen in time of ecological crisis every action must contribute to halt and reverse nature loss because nature be not just part of the solution it be the solution hope the minister will sit down with to discuss these point far as the bill enter the other house rise to speak to new clause in my name which consider the impact of our planning system on our creative and cultural industry and infrastructure these space be the foundation of our world beat creative industry and be also very important for our local community they be the engine of an industry which be grow at twice the rate of the rest of the economy they be the lab of sector that be big than our automotive aerospace and life science industry combine yet the creatives industry be under threat include from our disruptive planning system and onerous licensing regime my culture media and sport committee have hear that live music venue will be back to shut at the rate of two week by the end of the year that be in addition to electronic music venue and club which have be shut at the rate of three week my amendment seek to help prevent those closure by put duty on planning decision maker to apply the agent of change principle which have exist since the national planning policy framework in they require developer to ensure that their development do not disrupt exist business in future as well as place of worship school transport infrastructure and so on first the new clause would be good for venue of the grassroot music venue that close in one in four shut for operational reason include noise abatement order neighbour dispute and intervention by the local council in the previous parliament the committee chair hold roundtable in manchester at the night and day café an iconic venue we be there to meet representative of live music venue from across the north yet the operator could not attend their own roundtable because they be instead attend court hearing with manchester city council to settle three year noise abatement dispute costly and pointless legal dispute at that as it start due to single complaint by tenant who have move out long before the issue be resolve secondly the new clause would be good for developer and new neighbour consistent application of the agent of change principle will de risk and speed up planning and development it will ensure that the need of an exist cultural venue be consider from the start and save developer from late stage objection and lengthy expensive legal dispute down the line it will require developer and decision maker to think about the presence of exist venue and will benefit future tenant and homeowner who should be less impact overall finally the new clause would help local authority it be council that have the duty to detect statutory nuisance and investigate noise complaint it be council that serve noise abatement order and it be council that get drag into expensive and often pointless bun fight with local venue as the night and day café example illustrate encourage council to consider at the planning stage how developer and venue can find nice equilibrium in their interest can only help to save they time and money which be surely more efficient than settle matter in court the new clause have widespread support it take forward the recommendation of the cms committee in the previous parliament and be support by the whole live music sector from the operator of our small club pub and venue to the big arena and stadium it will benefit the breadth of our cultural infrastructure from our historic theatre to our pulsate nightclub it be build on evidence give by live uk music creative uk the music venue trust the night time industries association and the national arenas association the new clause be not about venue versus developer instead it be about ensure we have the balance right between build enough good home and make sure the place we be build keep the thing that make life worth live everyone in westminster and our constituency agree that our high street have be in decline so it be vital that we protect the place that be special to we our constituent and our community the place that provide platform for our creator and our world beat creative industry where we can make memory celebrate and have fun hope the government will support my new clause and if not today commit to make this law as soon as possible live music be in crisis the government need to listen rise to speak to amendment in my name and the name of most select committee chairs certainly most of those who cover departments include the chair of the business and trade committee my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne the chair of the energy security and net zero committee my hon friend the member for sefton central bill esterson the chair of the environmental audit committee my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael the chair of the housing communities and local government committee my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi and the chair of the transport committee my hon friend the member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury the amendment relate to the government new approach to the consultation around national policy statement and in particular to the parliamentary scrutiny of those statement there be currently process by which select committees join force to examine national policy statement and provide recommendation to the government but the government be propose to introduce what they call new reflective amendment procedure where an amendment to planning policy reflect new legislation change to government policy or relevant court decision since the policy guidance be put in place we all know that the government aim be to speed up the planning process but we need to be clear that reduce parliamentary scrutiny can have long term consequence be therefore seek reassurance from the minister as to how this will be manage this proposal will remove the requirement to respond to either resolution of either house of parliament or recommendation from committee of either house of parliament on the propose change instead the government would write to the appropriate select committee at the start of the public consultation period which be typically six to week and the committee would then have the option of invite ministers to discuss the propose change during that time my fellow chairs and be concerned about this change reduce the committees influence and enshrine in law that the government do not need to respond to the scrutiny or recommendation of select committees rise give way to the hon gentleman who have table similar amendment be grateful to the hon lady and the other select committee chairs for take up an issue that we take up in committee and about which there have be concern across the house the government may wish to change npss in the light of legal judgment but do she agree that change to they for policy reason particularly when they affect massive project like hinkley point and sizewell should continue to come before the house if move on to what will happen think the hon gentleman will be reassure there be big point here which do not have time to elaborate on in this debate this change be part of trend of government not appreciate the role of thoughtful thorough scrutiny from outside the whitehall bubble this be disease affect government of all party and of scrutiny from mps with detailed knowledge of the subject matter the hon gentleman of course have strong track record on this issue outside this place from before he become member of this house those who scrutinise through select committees often understand the system and how change in policy or law can have different effect within policy guidance because of the interaction it will have the bad case scenario here would be that committee do not have time to examine proposal or if it do have time that the government ignore the recommendation be grateful to the minister and his official for the time they have spend engage with and the clerk of the liaison committee on behalf of the select committees to try to mitigate those bad case risk in theory these change could sound quite reasonable but in practice there be risk that the government could lose useful voice that also reflect the view of other body select committees also get the chance to question ministers in public which be important for transparency and accountability select committees can also give force to the view and expertise share in public very often orally of body with knowledge of the technical change that could be introduce and wrap into new or revised policy guidance we have all be there when at the dispatch box minister promise that another minister will attend committee and be question but we be talk about have as little as six week to work with we have all be in situation in which minister diary be so busy that it be difficult for they to attend and that would not be good enough in this case hope the minister will give some reassurance that he will through the normal channel in whitehall ensure that every department be aware of the requirement for relevant minister to attend within period that allow the committee to produce report or respond to the government which do not mean at the end of six or week consultation period hope the minister can give those reassurance would like he to be very clear on the record acknowledge the effort make in committee to talk about this and some of the pledge make then but it be important that these change and the minister view and pledge be make clear in this chamber in committee the minister say that minister will make themselves available to speak at the committee during that period in so far as that be practical he also say that not all select committee will respond in the relevant period therefore elongate the report planning and infrastructure public bill committee april can clarify for and reassure the minister that it be the intention of those on committee corridor to ensure that these thing be deal with in proper and timely fashion hope that the minister will ensure both that minister attend in timely fashion and that there be proper approach that ensure that committee get advance notice of new planning policy statement or revised statement so that they have time to plan and get their duck in row in order to enhance the work of government by give they if necessary critical friend comment scrutiny in whatever form be absolutely vital if as hope the minister will put that on the record today will not push my amendment to vote it be vital that parliamentary scrutiny be protect as much as possible it be clear that we be today debate methodology rather than value certainly do not dispute the minister value at all we all want to see growth need meet and the environment protect the question that we be debate today be the good methodology for achieve those outcome have submit number of amendment cover three area which will rattle through as quickly as can all of which support the theme that my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos advance today and indeed that he have pursue in committee in previous week amendment relate to housing target it propose allow local authority to adopt target that reduce housing need rather than simply target to build home house building target be in many area part of the problem rather than the solution to housing need for example since the cornwall housing stock have be among the fast growing in the united kingdom it have almost treble yet housing problem for local people have get significantly bad over that time simply set house building target result in massive hope value be attach to every single community around cornwall have work as chief executive of charity that try to build affordable home can say that establish house building target make it more difficult to address the housing need of local people target that be about reduce need would change the dynamic of the planning system in place that face these problem unfortunately the approach to house building target that have be adopt by party over the previous decade be build on the delusion that private developer will collude with government to drive down the price of their finished product we can no long carry on in that delusion we can not and should not pursue counter productive methodology amendment and new clause be consequential on the fundamental change propose in amendment my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington have speak about introduce use class order to address the prevalence of non permanent occupancy in some area the previous government be look at bring in use class for holiday let but that should be extend to second home and all home of non permanent occupancy new clause which be consequential on new clause propose introduce sunset clause for planning permission to ensure that there be not perverse incentive for people to apply to change property use in order to enhance the value of their property when they sell it this be not about the politic of envy but the politic of social justice think those who represent area or constituency with large number of second home properly understand how these thing operate finally table number of amendment relate to affordability include new clause on affordable development and new clause new clause would prohibit cross subsidy or at least open market development on rural exception site those site should not be call rural exception site they should be call rural norm site that should be the methodology for deliver affordable home in rural area it should be drive by want to have affordable home in such location my hon friend be make an excellent case in north norfolk people want house building that genuinely meet local need and help address the housing crisis which be affect everyone in my constituency on affordability do he agree that we need to empower local authority to define what affordable mean in their area my hon friend be right about that affordability be define for rented accommodation either of market rent or the local housing allowance whichever be low but it be not sufficiently define for the intermediate market in rural area which include share ownership and discount sale there be way that affordability can be achieve and that should be do within local planning we should give local authority the power to define for the purpose of their community what be and be not affordable and we should strengthen the role of neighbourhood development plan in that respect as well new clause would put cap on developer profit lot of people do not understand how planning authority make their viability assessment when development be bring forward there be an assumption of developer profit of but when developer ask for amendment to the way that their planning application be view they will often have undertake two different valuation and will come with both one they present to the planning authority and one they keep in their back pocket one of the valuation come with violin and sob story about how they will lose out because of the development and how they be do it only for the community the other valuation be the reality we know that they be make killing out of other people poverty be pleased to support this important bill and the government amendment to it which will deliver the housing infrastructure and environmental protection that my constituent need first welcome the government enhancement to the environmental delivery plan they provide great clarity legal safeguard and appropriate flexibility to ensure that the plan restore and enhance our precious natural habitat the current piecemeal approach to offset environmental harm be not work the government sensible approach maintain exist protection for nature and add to they with the ability to fund high impact strategic nature recovery project be very lucky that there be several significant nature recovery project in my constituency such as sulham wood and meadow which have the pleasure of visit last week this project be maximise biodiversity on hectare of marginal arable land and be plant tree km of new hedgerow and new walnut orchard we need more big project like this would like to highlight the opportunity the bill present for our country chalk stream be proud to represent constituency that boast many wonderful waterway include the entire length of the river pang beautiful wind chalk stream that be point of local pride it be say to be the inspiration for the wind in the willows and it be love by family dog walker and angler alike but the precious pang be in crisis in just few short year the water quality have plummet to poor citizen scientist and angler test the river such as professor mike wilson and pete devery consistently report sample with completely unacceptable level of phosphate and coli the phosphate pollution from thames water sewage work be so bad that luminous green from the resultant algae can be see in satellite image thank all the campaigner citizen scientist and volunteer with whom have be work throughout my campaign to restore the pang also thank the action for river kennet ark project the rivers trust the angling trust pang valley flood forum and berks bucks and oxon wildlife trust as well as all member of the pang flagship chalk stream partnership which support range of initiative to restore the pang they be all dedicated advocate whose restoration effort be make real difference chalk stream be rare and valuable habitat their mineral rich stable water be home to plethora of specie the hon member be talk about chalk stream which be the rainforest of the uk chalk stream in my constituency have have over hour of non stop sewage and it sound like the river pang have be victim of something similar amendment be so important to protect our chalk stream and local people say to as development come that this be actually groundwater would she support amendment thank the hon member for her contribution will come to my view on that amendment give that of the world chalk stream be in england it be right that we consider chalk stream england rainforest we have duty as their custodian to protect they for future generation while some chalk stream have protection such as site of special scientific interest status many include the pang lack even that the bill alongside our landmark water legislation be an opportunity to expand the protection for chalk stream be grateful for the conversation have have with the minister on this issue and know how committed he be to our chalk stream so ask if he will commit to strengthen the protection for our chalk stream as this bill progress the bill be an opportunity to build the home and infrastructure that this country need boost our economy and protect precious habitat like the pang look forward to continue to support it rise to speak to new clause in my name first thank all member from party across the house who sign up to my new clause also thank mr speaker and his team for the novel offer he make this morning on how we might have deal with new clause new clause be very simple it seek to ensure that promise make to all of we as mps by prospective developer when consider application for large scale housing development be honour have lose count of the number of developer who have make promise about so call flagship housing development gain the support of the mp and other local community stakeholder apply for outline planning permission and then be grant it on the basis of good mixture of home in one case that of lutterworth east pledge be make by the developer to build minimum of affordable home those developer give the pledge obtain the support and gain outline planning permission but then few month or year or two later they seek to renege completely on the pledge give lutterworth east be one such example that should be informative for all hon member it be cautionary tale that we ought to have at the forefront of our mind when developer come to we make pledge lutterworth east be the development where minimum be to be affordable housing but what have the developer do mere two year after be give planning permission that developer without have to seek new planning permission simply apply to amend the section legal agreement put gun to the head of the local planning authority which have no choice other than to accept it for fear of lose housing for its target to reduce the affordable housing not to or to it seek affordable housing that be disgraceful breach of trust the local planning authority whose local plan require minimum affordable home allow significant decrease they settle on which mean that in the case of lutterworth east over family will be deny an affordable house the minister be not currently in his place but say to the government that the bill wholly lack any suggest power to deal with that ask they to take on board the case of lutterworth east and examine why the developer be allow to renege wholly on its commitment in way that totally exclude the local community there be no public consultation because it be not an application for planning permission it be merely change be really move by what the hon gentleman be talk about many of we will have have similar experience we have be hear so much about the importance of local decision making can not help but think if only there have be the necessary investment in skill in the planning team who make the decision and determination and that they have have planning committee behind they who by all account could have say you need to bring the application back in do he agree that we need to invest in local planning team so that they can resist such totally inappropriate application from developer welcome the hon lady suggestion and would welcome more resource go into local planning team but what we have here be problem which she may well encounter in her own constituency hon member should be very careful indeed when developer promise and affordable social and accessible home even with legally bind section agreement because those agreement can be change at whim when local planning authority be put under pressure do the hon gentleman agree with the liberal democrats that give the unreliability of section agreement and developer live up to they as he demonstrate the good way to get affordable home for his constituent and mine be through an increase amount of social housing deliver by the local council would welcome that the government need to take into account lutterworth east and to ask themselves why labour parliamentarian and conservative parliamentarian have have to go beg to the government to look into the matter the government purport to want to see more social housing more affordable housing and more accessible housing but with lutterworth east they have have the opportunity to look into that and have choose not to rectify the issue in conclude be aware that other wish to speak simply ask the government whether they be willing to have meeting with and the labour parliamentarian in question to discuss what they could do on this matter give that the developer incredibly be none other than county council may we please start by acknowledge something that still have not be acknowledge enough the current planning system be break nowhere be that clear than in our environmental and habitat regulation which part of the bill be hop to fix and which many amendment amendment in particular would make significantly bad let we start with couple of clear example first we have the low thames crossing some million be spend on planning application span over page that be more than time the length of war and peace at cost that be more than norway pay to build the world long road tunnel fifteen year on not single spade be in the ground secondly we be currently build the most expensive nuclear power station in the history of the human race at hinkley point why for the last eight year edf have be stick in regulatory wrangling over kid you not fish disco an acoustic system design to guide fish away from water intake million spend and still not single resolution my personal favourite be the infamous bat tunnel where million of taxpayer money be waste on tunnel that might save handful of bat from nearby forest though many expert argue it will more likely put they in harm way that be not plan it be parody while we argue about newts and bat tunnel what be really happen in britain be that child or more be grow up in temporary accommodation with all the consequence mention by my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi my hon friend say we have not confront how the planning system be break do he agree that we have not hear enough about how many child be homeless this evening and will be in the month ahead because we be not grapple with the housing crisis and that we can not do that until we address the infrastructure crisis hundred of thousand of child will wake up tomorrow morning in temporary accommodation as consequence of this and million of family will continue pay some of the high energy bill in the western world when russian tank roll into europe we be dangerously reliant on foreign oil and gas because our planning system consistently block the clean home grow energy generation that we so desperately need see some liberal democrat members laugh note that in many case it be their council that block that energy infrastructure from be build will the hon member give way in one of the wet country in europe we could face summer water shortage because we have not build single major reservoir in over year here be the real kick in the tooth we have pay all those price for rule that have fail even on their own term we have create endless hoop to jump through and pour public money into bizarre mitigation scheme while britain have become one of the most nature deplete country on earth we have lose over half our ancient woodland and one in six specie be at risk of extinction we have get few bird few butterfly and few mammal and yet more paperwork than ever before we should ask this if these rule be not help people and they be not help nature who on earth be they for we throw money at scattergun mitigation fish discos and bat tunnel while fail to invest in strategic landscape scale restoration that actually work we force every project to fit every issue on site even when that be more expensive less effective and totally irrational that mean ten of thousand of individual site by site protection which be bureaucratic inconsistent and scientifically out of date and all despite the fact that modern ecological science be clear that nature recovery depend on scale and connectivity not isolate microproject when be build the second runway at manchester airport have similar rant to my hon friend come to hate great crested newts which be get in the way of build that second runway surely there have to be solution with balance one that do not cost quarter of billion pound for look at the land around the low thames crossing but allow government and local government to put thing such as swift brick into housing there have to be balance start by appreciate the description of rant will keep rant on this point until do not have to speak to my constituent wake up in temporary accommodation because of this country failure to build note that there be middle ground in fact it be even well than middle ground because through this bill and the change we be propose we can improve the situation for nature and improve the situation for building include incentivise developer for example through the biodiversity net gain process to put swift brick in place what we currently have be not conservation system but cargo cult mimic the symbol of protection while the reality on the ground get bad contrast that with what protect nature actually look like from this government strategic land use framework that support farmer to deliver climate and nature benefit across million hectare of land more than half the size of wales ban bee kill pesticide back transition to regenerative farming and planting forest on double the amount of land that will be need to build the million home will my hon friend give way on that point will make some progress now we have bill that will finally move we towards environmental delivery plan that take far more strategic approach to improve nature and increase the building that this country so desperately need want these change to go far we need to look at the culture within our regulator especially natural england which have become too much of blocker to building but this bill be step forward and the amendment propose would be step backwards end with this plea especially to hon member on my own benches who seem to find themselves defend this broken status quo before you vote tonight talk to the people who will still be here after you ve go home speak to the person clean your office this evening and ask they what it be like when rent swallow up over half your salary because we have fail to build our way out of this housing crisis speak to the person who cook your lunch in the tea room and ask what it be like to raise kid in country with sky high energy bill because we fail to build home grow energy generation ask yourself who you be here to serve the broken spreadsheet or the people who send we here if we keep put more and more barrier into our planning system it be hard work family across this country who will pay the price let we fix our planning system and get britain build again thank the minister and the member of the bill committee for their hard work on this legislation regret however that the minister have be so resistant to amendment from my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos and from other on the liberal democrat benches which now rise to support my constituent in bicester and woodstock want to see planning system that deliver decent affordable home for those exclude from housing that recognise that investment in infrastructure must come before housing development and that do not create false distinction between development and protect nature linda and gary live in my constituency gary have complex need and linda be his carer their property be not suitable gary can not shower or get to the garden by himself linda and gary have be bid to west oxfordshire district council for property suitable to meet gary need for more than year but they have be continually unsuccessful as many hon member have state we have crisis of social housing in this country that be why liberal democrats want to see an additional social home build every year through amendment and why new clause be so important prevent developer from duck the delivery of social home we also need developer to develop the building that have be consent in cherwell district council in my constituency more than home have be consent but not build that have lead to crisis with village such as ambrosden and launton at the mercy of opportunist developer who have hoover up site not contain in the local plan new clause would put an end to the land banking of consented site force developer to use they or lose they on second reading highlight to the secretary of state that there be three nationally significant infrastructure project propose in my constituency these mega scheme relate to energy and transport they may bring local benefit but my constituent be deeply concerned by the way decision be take out of the hand of local representative they be especially concerned that these nsips sit outside local plan so that their cumulative impact be not consider when other decision be take amendment would ensure oversight of national policy statement and allow member of this house to scrutinise the government approach to national project local infrastructure be also critical in my constituency bicester kidlington and number of village anticipate rapid housing growth in the come year yet our physical and social infrastructure be already struggle to cope my constituent want assurance that housing growth will be precede by sufficient investment in gp surgery dentistry and school and college place as well as water infrastructure energy capacity and transport network new clause would require local infrastructure to be complete while new clause and would ensure that water and drainage infrastructure be sufficient for development the minister acknowledge in his speech that many organisation and leader devote to protect nature such as the berkshire buckinghamshire and oxfordshire wildlife trust and believe the chief executive of the rspb beccy speight be deeply concerned by the way minister have characterise measure to address the nature emergency as blocker to development the minister dispute that so it be disappointing that the government have not accept new clause which would have have the modest goal of encourage swift brick and other measure for wildlife in new development hope he will also reconsider new clause which set out the government principal commitment to take all reasonable step to avoid adverse environmental effect and urge the government to accept new clause which would ensure fair level of community benefit for new energy infrastructure project at the same time this bill miss an opportunity to raise the environmental standard of new home welcome the minister commitment at the weekend that new home will have solar panel by default and the tribute he pay to my hon friend the member for cheltenham max wilkinson for campaign on that issue however regret that the government have not accept new clause which would have set zero carbon standard for new home the minister and have frequently discuss the write ministerial statement of december under the previous administration which undermine the effort of west oxfordshire district council in my constituency to set low carbon standard for the development of salt cross appreciate that he may not accept new clause but will he at least agree today to withdraw that write ministerial statement and to release the development of high quality home that will be good for the environment and good for their new resident rise to speak in favour of the planning and infrastructure bill because it will build high quality housing reform energy grid connection and deliver critical energy infrastructure also rise to speak in favour of new clause table in my name and back by mp with cross party support to achieve happy healthy childhood we should bring forward statutory duty in england like those in scotland and wales to ensure inclusive and sufficient play opportunity the foreword to the first and only play strategy to be publish by labour government in state time and space to play safely be integral to our ambition to make england the good country in the world for child and young people to grow up that ambition remain but the strategy be scrap because few year after its publication with million budget the coalition government draw red line through everything we need to prioritise play in this parliament why because in the intervene year hundred of playground in our constituency have be board up and allow to rust this have be especially true in disadvantaged community our poor community have be the great casualty of austerity and we know the consequence screen time dominate and we have rise in social medium politician be very good at tell child to get off their screen without provide the alternative play opportunity with more play and less screen time we can have well mental health outcome for child we can have more safety in our street and we can have well social development opportunity play be prevention when we improve life quality and life chance we save the public purse significant sum in the long run because we reduce demand on the nhs on our council and on our social service my hon friend be make an excellent speech and he be clearly speak on the basis of great deal of experience as former senior councillor in oxford wonder if he would like to dwell on some other aspect of this because in many way play also benefit child social development and their ability to work and concentrate on learn at school do he agree that there be many other benefit to play and will he praise local authority such as reading that be actively promote play area my hon friend will know that have spend lot of time in read get to know his constituent and the community and do indeed praise the people that he be talk about agree that with time and space for play child will have the very good start in life but this be not just about child it be also about their family we be in an ongoing cost of living crisis with play and outdoor play in particular we have free opportunity for parent and guardian to give their child the support the social development and the leisure opportunity that they need and deserve my hon friend be make powerful speech in my constituency the scalby school playing field long serve the community as vital green space but that space be under threat as the council be seek to remove protection which could lead to its be sell do my hon friend agree that that be why this new clause be so necessary as it would ensure that the council either keep the field or make equivalent provision of land for child to play on make it habit to agree with my hon friend and will keep that tradition today do indeed agree and she rather anticipate the point that be about to make new clause be so important because it provide key thing that our child need it would require developer to deliver and fund adequate play in their community it would ensure no net loss without equivalent provision as consequence of development but let be clear this be not about require every development to have blanket requirement it be not about hold every development hostage because we know that development be important for growth in our community it be about ensure that council be well equipped and that planning authority be support to take view in the round of what play sufficiency would be in give area and indeed to use contribution from developer to fund adequate indeed excellent play provision know that my hon friend be passionate about this issue as be as signatory to this new clause in my constituency of stafford eccleshall and the village have be work with group of local parent on joint campaign for safe inclusive park for neurodiverse child those space benefit not just neurodiverse child but parent who also need somewhere safe to go with their child and young people in recognition of the cost of living crisis do my hon friend agree that these space should be provide for all child not just those who be neurotypical and that they should provide space for their parent too my hon friend and have talk many time about the importance of inclusive play and commend she as fantastic champion for child with special educational need and disability to access those play opportunity agree with she entirely and one thing that my new clause would do be to introduce requirement for planning authority to assess play sufficiency particularly inclusive play sufficiency that be critically important point in nutshell we need to have national policy framework and national planning action that will ensure that the voice of child and their family be properly listen to that they be consult on their need and that planning authority be require and support to introduce the outdoor play equipment and area that can so enhance their life chance in so do we would be build on the work of that last labour government that be just talk about if you ever want to enjoy beautiful photograph that sum up all of what the last labour government be do have look at ed balls and andy burnham on swing announce the national play strategy it be fantastic sight genuinely you can see in their face the joy that come from play and extend play opportunity you can see that they be ministers who be fantastically enjoy their job and that be because they be deliver for child that strategy be critical development in the world of play and the play sector respond so positively to it it come with million of investment to provide up to new or refurbish playground still get send photograph by people who have see those playground with the department for children schools and families logo on they with its beautiful rainbow and we should have more of that to conclude this bill be critical for child development this be also pro growth new clause because we have in our play sector small family business who contribute to our economy to the tune of million and be power employment and economic opportunity in our community our country feel like it need lick of paint at time we need pothole fill we need litter collect and we need playground repair in so do we can bring hope back to our community and in do that we can help people to feel positive about the potential for politic to make change it be pleasure to follow the hon member for bournemouth east tom hayes that be an important speech and concur entirely with his priority there it be really important that we invest in the social infrastructure of play for the benefit of child although not necessarily for the benefit of ed balls and andy burnham an appalling image be conjure by the hon gentleman there but concur with his general point want to speak in support of my new clause which would require the government to designate more chalk stream as protect site within six month of the bill pass we know that of the world chalk stream be in this country there be only of they so they be rare and very special habitat most of those chalk stream be in southern england and be glad to say that most of the most important one be in wiltshire morgan hill on the edge of my constituency be hydrological dividing line where drop of rain can end up in the river kennet and then the thames flow out to the north sea alternatively it can go down the hampshire avon into the english channel or it can go out west along the bristol avon and end up in the atlantic this be very significant place with water from wiltshire flow through the whole of southern england those chalk stream be million year old and they have flow clear and clean all that time until very recently in the modern era they be over abstracted too much water be be take out because of overdevelopment and bad house building they be contaminate with agricultural run off and of course sewage spill pay tribute and give my sincere congratulation to all the campaigner in my constituency we will all have similar organisation locally but action for the river kennet in particular be do great work to support that river and angler school and farmer in our area also pay tribute to the southern streams initiative that support farmer across wiltshire to restore the health of the soil and the water in our area the last government introduce some important new measure to restore and preserve the health of our chalk stream these include the water restoration fund which ensure that the fine levy on water company for sewage spill go to restore nature in the area that have be harm we introduce storm overflow discharge reduction plan stewardship scheme that address the question of agricultural run off and in the levelling up and regeneration act we ensure that chalk stream be consider as part of environmental assessment for new development we also introduce the chalk stream recovery plan which be sadly halt by the labour government when they come into power last year they keep some of our legacy be glad to say but they have pause the sustainable farming incentive and be afraid to say that we expect cut to stewardship scheme in the spending review this week crucially they scrap the water restoration fund itself thames water be fin over million last month because of sewage spill in our area that money should have go to support natural restoration in the thames valley area include in wiltshire it have be take by the treasury we do not know where that money will go the government have also scrap the chalk stream recovery plan my concern about the bill and why table the amendment be that it will put additional pressure on our chalk stream yes we need new building absolutely that priority be right and what we need and build in our backyard but the backyard of wiltshire be swindon we need to see more intense development in urban area where the real demand for housing be that will be great blessing to swindon and wiltshire if we can make that happen the new clause in my name would protect more chalk stream as protect site be glad to say that the kennet and the hampshire avon be already sssi but we need to see more stream designate in that way it be not enough to protect only of the chalk stream in this country the more designation the well that would create genuine momentum behind the preservation of chalk stream so that when development be be consider we can be sure that these vital national natural asset be properly protect for the future the bill before the house have the potential to be one of the most pro growth piece of legislation pass by this place for decade and to transform our country for the well but the amendment propose will blunt its impact and make we all bad off we should reject they for the prosperity of our constituent and the future of our country every day in this place have to be about our constituent and the life they lead in chipping barnet time and again see the impact of our failure to build home take maryam victim of domestic violence and mother of seven year old work zero hour contract she find herself with nowhere suitable to live to the point that she be live in car or take hayley wheelchair user live in property that be not accessible for she due to lack of available housing that be appropriate for she she be often housebound because she simply can not leave she home without support these be the story of britain today but it do not need to be like this this bill give we once in generation opportunity to fix many of the thing hold our country back for too long we have not build enough in this country and we be pay huge price for that under investment in our home and infrastructure have make we all bad off both financially and socially live in home that skewer the prospect of good life that be why do not support the opposition amendment also do not support amendment propose by my hon friend the member for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff which sadly miss the mark labour be elect on manifesto that seek to prioritise growth and make people well off the bill demonstrate how that be possible alongside improve protection for nature the nature restoration fund be genuine win win but its successful and timely implementation be put at risk by the amendment will the hon member give way will make bit more progress let we take the example of nutrient neutrality it be estimate that no few than home across the country have be block by natural england on that basis that be because on site mitigation on site by site basis be often virtually impossible and those home remain stalled the environmental delivery plan that natural england will produce will mean that rather than home be hold up by those rule the very issue cause nutrient neutrality challenge can be address in strategic way well for building for nature and for people edp take the challenge of nutrient neutrality seriously and mean that builder can get stall site build provide much need new home my hon friend may have slightly confuse the point of amendment which be merely to address the concern raise by the office for environmental protection and to ensure that the nature restoration fund work to deliver exactly the point that he describe with the right nature protection will come to the point my hon friend raise in second if the amendment be adopt the home that have be block to date would continue to be block and vast number would face unacceptable delay or indeed never be build what would happen under the amendment as we can interpret it be that we would first have to wait for the edp to be draft for the relevant funding to be secure and for the funding to be distribute to the relevant farmer or other who can help with the mitigation the work would then have to take place the impact of the mitigation would have to be monitor and the monitoring would then have to conclude that it have be success before any new home in an area could be build where nutrient neutrality be concern do the hon member agree that what he have just describe would lead to more delay in the system which would mean that more planning permission be hold up something that opposition member have complain about if the amendment be pass the requirement would also add lot more expense to the system which would mean more viability problem and few social home be build agree with those point it would also make it virtually impossible to meet our manifesto commitment on which we be elect to build the million home that we need over this parliament the hon member know that be big fan of his he make speech about our and other amendment block the delivery of home will he therefore criticise his government who have reduce the number of home require in his constituency through reduce the number of house be build in london under his mayor expect the hon member know that the housing target have be reduce in london because of the additional premium that be put on by the previous government just to make life more difficult for the mayor of london which we all know conservative love to do we be try to be reasonable and proportionate in the location of the new home as be say it be important for we to do all we can to ensure that we can hit our target of million new home as much as respect my hon friend the member for north east hertfordshire and his work in this space hope his amendment will not command the support of the house today know my hon friend and members on both side of the house be strong supporter of social housing but without the unamended change in the bill we will not get the social home that we need to be build people have speak movingly about those live in temporary accommodation spend four year or so as child live in emergency and temporary accommodation be homeless for number of year back or year ago there be not that many young child who be homeless and in temporary accommodation there be now child one in child in london one in every single class in temporary accommodation we can not allow system that fail both nature and those child to persist implore any colleague think of vote for the amendment to think of those child and the vital home that could be build and build quickly and at pace will my hon friend give way should make progress so that other can speak my hon friend and will have to talk later this bill and this government be all about the economic growth that ultimately be the route to more job more opportunity and high living standard well life for all of we in every part of the country that be the potential of this bill and we must match the scale of the problem with the scale of our ambition britain economic decline have go on for too long family be suffer with crippling cost of live crisis drive by high housing cost in many part of the country and high energy bill everywhere we just do not invest as country we do not build and year after year we find ourselves surprised that we be bad off and that we be stick in doom loop from which no politician in recent decade if we be honest have have the gut to pull we out we finally have government elect on promise to wrest we from this decline and legislation that take step in the right direction to do just that of course there be more to do much more but this be strong legislative start for the prosperity of all our constituent hope the bill pass unamended today rise to speak in support of new clause and if have time mid bedfordshire be fast grow area and have accommodate more than its fair share of new home in the past decade since the two district that my constituency cover have deliver over new home include the new town of wixams yet this government would have we believe that those people in my constituency who have see housing growth outpace service who be still wait for the long promise gp surgery for train station and for other infrastructure and who fear that the character of their historic ends village be be lose be all blocker because they be concerned about what more badly plan development would mean for the overstretch amenity and service in their area the bill be an opportunity to lead it be an opportunity not to pit blocker against builder but to deliver system that turn blocker into builder regrettably as it stand the bill will fail but it do not have to fail my new clause would create fairer way of manage new town by reform the new town programme which seem expressly design to make local community resent the town foist upon they it would replace that new town model with one that do not involve double whammy of house building currently community that want to do the right thing and build the house that people need find every patch of countryside be hoover up because the government have add new town on top of the developable area in their district my new clause would close the loophole that allow planning authority to grant development on floodplain that be perfectly sensible and pragmatic position people in maulden in my constituency know all too well how bad development compound the risk of flooding they be honest hard work people who want to enjoy the warm and dry home that their hard work have pay for but the government be back big box developer not they the new clause would prevent developer from get away high and dry with their profit while our constituent pay the price in flooded home new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds would do the same by ensure that where development do happen developer must deliver and maintain sustainable urban drainage infrastructure the current guidance be too vague and the current rule too lax to ensure that our resident be protect my mid bedfordshire constituency have lot of beautiful village but they be under threat from the creep spread of urban sprawl that threaten to merge they into conglomerate mass of development which fly in the face of the historically gentle and natural evolution of our beautiful estate village therefore endorse new clause for its effort to stop our beautiful village from be lose to future generation to put it more simply the sense of urban sprawl be about the green belt not just between specific village but between community we see that between streetly and pheasey in my constituency on the edge of birmingham do he agree that it would help to tackle the problem if the government adopt truly brownfield first approach by develop the million home that it be estimate be available on brownfield site absolutely agree with my right hon friend those green space on the edge of and between town be at risk it be not just the field that be at risk but people access to green space which be vital for mental health and wellbeing in relation to new clause which my hon friend support do he agree that the government could very easily accept it because it enable and encompass an exist piece of legislation and could make vast difference to many of the development propose why do he think the minister will not accept it the shadow minister make the case for so do not think need to absolutely support new clause will make final point so that we can hear from another speaker be proud to support new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for mid leicestershire mr bedford community such as wixams in mid bedfordshire too often find that the housing first infrastructure second approach that our planning system prefer mean that they get all of the housing but none of the infrastructure that be just not right it be not right that nearly two decade on from the first shovel go into the ground it be still not clear when wixams will get its long promise gp surgery while more and more house be plan around it we must end that cycle and ensure that where infrastructure be promise infrastructure be deliver that be what the new clause will do we have once in generation opportunity to build planning system that turn blocker into builder we must do well than this bill which fear will only build more blocker rise order give members notice that will take the time limit down to four minute after the next speaker rise to speak in favour of the amendment in my name particularly amendment which have supporter from across the house every family stick on housing waiting list and every child suffer the insecurity of temporary accommodation represent moral stain on our country welcome ministers urgency in seek to address those corrosive failure which for million underpin lingering sense that our country be deeply break however fear that the government have misdiagnose the root cause of the housing crisis which be fundamentally that private capital will never deliver the public good that we need the evidence be clear that process that uphold democracy and nature be not the problem profit maximisation be the planning system consistently approve more home than the private sector deliver and when home be build they be too often unaffordable for those at the sharp end of the housing crisis last year less than of home deliver through section be for social rent after year of deregulation hop that just one more wave will finally make the market deliver be simply not credible it certainly do not justify strip away the few protection that we have leave for our natural environment especially when the government own assessment could provide no concrete evidence that it would work we be already one of the most nature deplete nation in the world and we can spend what little remain of our natural inheritance only once if the government press ahead with their proposal the national account will soon be empty there be the kernel of good idea in nature restoration fund but the weight of evidence against the way that it have be draft be overwhelming nature organisation academic ecologist and the office for environmental protection have all raise serious concern welcome the tone of early commitment from government front benchers but amendment give ministers the opportunity to rescue something positive from the wreckage of this legislation by ensure that environmental delivery plan serve their purpose without allow developer to pay cash to destroy nature and that conservation take place before damage so that endangered specie be not push close to extinction before replacement habitat be establish the amendment outline that conservation must result in improvement to the specific feature harm that will protect irreplaceable habitat such as chalk stream our natural capital which underpin all prosperity in this country decline by third from to this be chance to reverse that trend give that letchworth garden city in my constituency spring into life without single mature tree be fell we can build the home that we desperately need to clear our housing waiting list in harmony with nature to conclude the primary value to which our politic have seek to appeal have for decade be self serve ambition but as the party of change and of the people labour have duty to serve high virtue hope be talk about hope for future in which our nation no long imagine housing as an ever appreciate financial asset and instead build home that provide the secure and healthy environment essential for our physical and mental wellbeing and that allow everyone to put down the root necessary to grow and fulfil their true potential hope for future in which we create connected community of friendship and co operation rather than have the grey and miserable utilitarianism of commuter dormitory hope for future in which we take every possible opportunity to restore the glory of british nature and can meaningfully say for the first time in generation that we have leave the nation rich than we find it in short hope that we choose by design to surround every man woman and child in these island with constant proof that life be beautiful declare my interest as co chair of the all party group on local nature recovery when the government first introduce this bill they brand it win win they say that we could build the home and infrastructure that this country desperately need and protect and restore nature we have see in my constituency one of the fast grow area of the country with liberal democrat run local planning authority that it be indeed possible to demand from developer both ambitious house building and high environmental standard that restore nature we liberal democrats believe that healthy childhood for all child include home that be energy efficient and warm not cold and damp access to green space for mental and physical health and infrastructure include public transport gps and school when do well nature be partner to the healthy home and green energy that our country need however through this bill the government risk take wreck ball to good quality development nature be not blocker to development we be point the figure at the wrong culprit and this be cheap false rhetoric nature be not to blame the government own watchdog the office for environmental protection have publicly warn that the bill in its current form will be regression from current environmental protection rather than increase the number of home help nature and help we to meet our bind climate and nature pledge instead it will remove vital safeguard and put protect site and specie at risk over lead environmental organisation include the rspb the wildlife trust and the national trust have raise the alarm about part of the bill with its very worrying plan to move to cash to trash model for the nature restoration fund know the minister have reject that characterisation but in the environmental audit committee we hear robust evidence from expert witness that we could call it pay some amount later for something somewhere fund do my hon friend share my dismay that the government be not receptive to amendment to part that would restore the mitigation hierarchy and protection for irreplaceable specie and ancient woodland completely concur we appreciate the work do by my hon friend and other in the bill committee and by table numerous amendment at this stage to help the government improve the bill why do we need more stringent regulation and demand on developer rather than less why do we need evidence and mitigation approve prior to development rather than pay later for something somewhere nature restoration fund it be because we have the evidence to show what happen without much need investment in enforcement capacity for local council on the environmental audit committee we hear the conclusion of the lost nature report for nearly home across development only half of the environmental pledge be keep the other be miss in action staggering of hedgehog highway of bug box and of both bat and bird box we need more that be why be speak to the target amendment my hon friend have mention to make sure we can have this win win his ew clause would reinstate the mitigation hierarchy as legal duty simply put the duty be first avoid harm then mitigate if that be not possible and only compensate and offset as last resort this principle have underpin environmental planning for decade and can not be cast aside amendment to and new clause and aim to address the office for environmental protection concern and strengthen the overall improvement test for environmental delivery plan support new clause which require local plan to have due consideration to the local nature recovery strategy which be currently silent in the planning system amendment and would give protection to england globally rare chalk stream our rainforest and our groundwater we have of the world chalk stream many of they in lib dem constituency include mine yet they remain unprotected hope the government will consider amendment to the bill because we face choice pass this nature wreck bill as it stand or fix it by adopt amendment to protect chalk stream restore wildlife and create planning system that work with nature not against it know what the liberal democrats will be vote for rise to speak as member of the housing communities and local government committee and in support of new clause for too long affordable housing have become catch all term that mean anything but shared ownership and discount market scheme be product that may work for some but for many they offer no real housing security what those people need be not the option of get foot on the property ladder in the distant future but roof over their head now they need security stability and home that be truly affordable and that mean social rent if we be serious about tackle the housing emergency then clear national target for delivery of social rent home be essential that be why support new clause which would bring forward the accountability and direction that we need to get building and start deliver for those who have be let down for too long as housing charity shelter identifie build more social rent home be the only last solution to the housing emergency those home be genuinely affordable because their rent be link to local income there be secure tenancy and any rent increase be more predictable in my constituency know colleague from across the house will recognise this from their inboxe family be trap in substandard housing or temporary accommodation for year on end many of we have fear become desensitise to the story of family with no kitchen to cook in no quiet space for child to learn and no peace in which to rest that be the daily reality for far too many family in the uk this be national scandal let we be honest it do not appear overnight for over decade the previous government fail to build the home that this country desperately need they dismantle council house building slash local authority budget and leave the private rent sector unchecked those failure have leave this government with an inheritance of hollow out system that respond to homelessness after the fact instead of prevent it at root welcome the fact that this labour government be change this reality for family in my constituency through significant policy change and by allocate million to the affordable home programme and be proud that significant proportion of those home will be for social rent but we need to go far publishing or update planning guidance on how local and national decision maker can contribute to the delivery of social rent home can make significant difference that would align planning investment and delivery with share goal we know the scale of the challenge as many have note we need to build social rent home each year not just for the remainder of this parliament but for the next decade to meet current demand and get on top of the deep backlog we must equip council and delivery partner with the resource plan power and clarity of mission that they need new clause support that clarity make sure that every local and regional planning decision be pull in the same direction agree with the minister on the need for strategic planning the potential that spatial development strategy have to unlock large scale regional housing solution and the power of land value uplift to fund affordable home these be important tool but they would be well support by clear target set national target for social rent home be not about whitehall dictate number from above it be about say that we be serious about tackle homelessness echo the word of this government this country need builder not blocker central to that sentiment must be set clear social housing strategy so that we know not just that we must build but how much we must build and hold ourselves accountable for deliver those home will be brief as many colleague be wait to contribute will speak only to new clause which call for review of the standard method of assess local housing need couple of colleague have already mention aspect of it but will talk about it for three reason it put too many housing development requirement on rural area rather than city in area like mine there be physical constraint such as national park which can cause difficulty and as specify in the new clause the system need to take account of different type of housing and their affordability first the new formula mean that too much housing be be put into rural area away from urban area as we have hear in some part of london and birmingham target be be reduce but there have be uplift in housing number nationally and uplift in my constituency this be not north south issue it be repeat in rural area throughout the country include in the far north west and the far north east it do not correct what some people may think of as an historical imbalance where all the development be in town and not in the country because over the past couple of decade development have be disproportionately in predominantly rural area rather than predominantly urban area this be also bad for the government growth agenda because as the resolution foundation and other have point out skew development towards city and town be well for growth because of connectivity secondly be concerned about physical constraint such as national park development in constituency such as mine where over half the land area be inside national park create particular issue in the area just outside the national park the minister and his official have be listen and they have be very helpful hope that they will continue to give the issue full consideration and that there will be change thirdly big thing that be include in the text of the new clause be about the mix in housing new clause state that the secretary of state should review the standard method for assess local housing need and should consider different type of property look at the price per square metre rather than price per unit in area such as mine and in many constituency across the country we want more affordable house to be build but that be not what the formula deliver because often not exclusively but disproportionately it be more attractive to developer to build large five bedroom executive house that combine with the fact that overall new build home trade at premium to the exist housing stock mean that the unaffordability of an area get bad as result of the formula not well the formula then react upon itself to say you be now more unaffordable area now give we more of these executive home do not think that be what minister want so the new clause be helpful proposal from the opposition hope that ministers will give it serious consideration to ensure that the housing formula create incentive for high quality but low price housing the new clause do not prejudge exactly how that should be do but call upon the government to look again at the system know the minister be reflective minister and hope he will do just that rise to speak to my amendment which seek to address long stand and deeply entrench failure in our planning system the chronic undersupply of gypsy and traveller site across england my amendment seek to increase fairness in the system and to enable rather than hinder the provision of adequate culturally appropriate accommodation for gypsy and traveller community for too long the accommodation need of gypsies and travellers have be overlook by the planning system research by friends families and travellers and dr simon ruston look at local planning authority and find that site provision have barely change since the legal duty to provide they be scrap in of the public site in those area be build before mean that just have be develop in the past year that be only new site across all local authority in three decade decision on gypsy and traveller site have frequently be underpin by prejudice whether overt or institutional too often propose development be block or delay by local opposition that be not meet with political will or leadership site delivery also suffer from lack of inclusion at the strategic planning level where gypsy and traveller site provision can be absent from local plan and exclude from land allocation this absence be not an accident it be the result of year of structural marginalisation that the bill must now correct acknowledge the positive step that the government take in which work toward address some of those failure however we must go far if we intend to support provision and address inequality in the planning system we have see an increase in private site which be welcome but we often hear about the long draw out difficult and expensive process that individual family go through to achieve planning permission it be crucial to acknowledge that just as with other community home and land ownership be not within reach of many and social provision be much need we be still see troubling trend the number of socially rent pitch be decline accord to the traveller caravan count live table the number of socially rent pitch have fall in the past five year with reduction of pitch my amendment would ensure that gypsy and traveller accommodation need be explicitly include in strategic planning which mean embed the site provision in the spatial development strategy under propose new section to the planning and compulsory purchase act those new strategy would help to shape housing across whole region leave out gypsy and traveller site would repeat the mistake of the past other key planning change need to be address in this bill but will speak with the all party parliamentary group for gypsies travellers and roma in due course finally remind the house that the government have commit to deliver million new home by if that ambition be to be truly inclusive it must include everyone that mean make space literally and politically for community that have be move on fence off and forget urge the government to consider these amendment at later stage not just for the sake of legislative clarity but for the future of gypsies and travellers across the country rise to speak to new clause on the issue of cable ploughing specifically on the plan put forward by green gen cymru it propose km power line much of which would be suspend on pylon across the breathtake twyi valley and an additional kilometre of power line across the equally beautiful teifi valley this be not just any landscape it be the heart of rural wales these be not just two valley across rural wales they be treasure by community that have live and work there for generation from the beginning resident and farmer make one thing clear we support green energy but it do not have to come at the cost of our countryside we have call persistently for cable to be place underground so that we can embrace sustainable future while preserve wales natural beauty and agricultural land unfortunately our voice have go unheard surveyor have come on to the land without proper respect disregard the right of landowner and in some case people have feel intimidate and pressure into sign away land that have be in their family for century welcome the hon member contribution as she be speak to my new clause this be huge issue in suffolk coastal where we have national grid and scottishpower renewables make landfall and farmer in my constituency have similar experience to farmer in her constituency after this debate perhaps we can request meeting with the minister and share these example in person would love to have that opportunity thank the hon lady for put forward her new clause it be pleasure to sign up to it we should not expect the behaviour that mention from those who claim to be build green future let we be honest if green gen cymru have choose to place the cable underground from the start as the new clause propose it would have save itself significant trouble it argue that that be too expensive but what about the cost of delay and the legal cost of take landowner to court which be what have be happen there be another cost the cost of resilience just look at what happen over the last winter during storm darragh and storm éowyn overhead line fail power be lose in my area for up to seven day and compensation from the national grid have to be pay if those cable have be place underground the impact would have be minimal long term thinking be not just the right thing but the practical thing to do remind the chamber that wales have the well being of future generation wales act which be commitment to development that be truly sustainable and do not compromise the ability of our child and grandchild to thrive just to cut cost today let we ensure that the transition to clean energy serve the need of both the present and the generation yet to come let we ensure that it be not do to our community but do with they let we deliver future that be both green and ground rise to speak to amendment on allotment and community garden and to new clause on landfill site both of which stand in my name the uk currently have shortage of allotment with nearly people on english local authority waiting list we need more space to grow for the million people in the uk who have no garden at home share space such as community garden be vital lifeline to nature be proud that my amendment be support by the royal horticultural society the horticultural trades association member of the national network for community gardening and the national allotment society as well as by member across the house without be overly prescriptive my amendment aim to tackle the erratic provision of allotment and community garden across the country make they an essential part of all spatial development strategy in her correspondence with the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government my hon friend the member for bethnal green and stepney rushanara ali say that because there be nothing prevent local authority from include those green space in their strategy amendment such as mine be not need would like to refute that that be precisely the problem person space to grow should not be dependent on their postcode or the whim of their council that be especially the case give that the loss of allotment land over the past be eight time great in deprive community such as mine in his annual report sir chris whitty say make access to green space easy and more equitable would go long way toward remove barrier to improve physical activity level and could significantly improve the health of england increasingly urban population these small but mighty green space be about more than just vegetable they be essential to support health nature recovery and food security they also supercharge biodiversity because the quality of soil on allotment create unique environment in which life can thrive in the midst of nature crisis gardener and amateur horticulturist be our secret weapon what be more allotment create space for education and social project with so many on waiting list or block from turn an unloved patch of land into community garden and with desperate need for nature recovery my campaign represent win win for the government now turn to my new clause which come in direct response to gross injustice for my own constituent droppingwell tip in rotherham be close in the follow determined campaign by local resident it be subsequently cap and return to natural state two decade later in permit variation be grant by the environment agency allow landfill operation to resume without any notice to resident while the environment agency have the power to conduct public consultation it choose not to do so its argument be that as planning permission have be grant in the no further scrutiny be require vital issue such as traffic noise pollution and the impact on neighbouring property be give no consideration whatsoever it can not be right that landfill operator can so easily evade public scrutiny simply by reopen long dormant site nor can it be right that my constituent view have be totally ignore while my new clause come too late for rotherham it would prevent the right of other community from be trample by ensure that planning permission for landfill site would automatically lapse after year of dormancy any proposal to resume landfill operation would be require to be subject to full scrutiny through the planning system my amendment can make real difference and hope government front benchers will support they have always be very clear that my top priority be the protection of the buckinghamshire countryside and all of our farmland for the production of food not for development it be through that lens that rise to speak to number of amendment that think will make this horror show of bill that tiny bit well first will speak to new clause which deal with sustainable drainage and new clause which would stop development on floodplain can think of so many example in my constituency where development have either happen directly on the floodplain or cause horrendous flooding concern in community in ickford the developer expert say that flooding would be once in year eventuality in an area that flood six time in six month stand with the water lap at the top of my wellie before that development be build to try to make point and now those home be build guess what on worminghall road in ickford the house that be there before be regularly flood likewise the construction of have have an impact on flooding in calvert green calvert green simply do not flood before pour concrete into the field next door and now guess what it do also support new clause which would stop plan permission in case where illegal development take place can think of example in my constituency such as between the village of askett and longwick where illegal development take place yet the planning inspector have perversely now reward that bad behaviour by give planning permission bad behaviour should not be reward and that new clause would stop it other have speak about chalk stream which be incredibly important in buckinghamshire and new clause which would designate chalk stream as protect site be incredibly important want to spend couple of minute focus on the big new clause new clause be about the protection of village mid buckinghamshire be make up of many village some of which can no long be recognise as village haddenham which be not really village any more have grow exponentially and be now struggle for infrastructure and now see the threat of another home on top stoke mandeville have more home propose which would see it essentially merge with wendover this be unsustainable and challenge the rural identity of buckinghamshire strongly believe that those new protection should be put in place new clause would stop all solar development and battery storage development on any grade of agricultural land this inefficient technology will not solve the problem we face as country the world bank itself have say that only one country anywhere in the world be less suited to solar than the united kingdom and that be ireland it be simply not an efficient technology to solve our energy crisis small modular reactor and nuclear power be the answer not trash our countryside with solar and battery storage finally new clause be an appeal on the basis of fairness my constituency have already suffer at the hand of big infrastructure predominantly high speed but other project too it be about fairness where community against their will have be force to take these huge massive infrastructure project my constituent will live for more than two decade in construction site they should be let off some of the other housing target that be come along they should be let off that further unwanted development because they have already take enough there have be many reference to the housing crisis and impassioned speech which have welcome like every other constituency in london we have housing crisis on scale not see before and it have largely be cause by council house be sell off and not replace what have happen in my area be salutary lesson about infrastructure development crossrail be go through and the elizabeth line have now go through so land value price have go through the roof in central hayes have more than property be build we have no lack of planning permission in fact we have plan permission come out of our ear but most local people can not even think of afford what be be build many have try to become leaseholder and now they be be hit by huge increase in service charge and some can not even sell on their property as result with new clause which no one have mention so far we be ask the government to look at how we can capture land value there be discussion to be have about land value tax and think its time be come many of those property be describe as affordable but they be not affordable to local people that be why new clause be so important because we do not want affordable property we want social rent property in fact would like simply to give our local authority the resource and to let they start build again so that we can have place of decent standard with rent that people can afford some year ago be on the greater london council planning committee and be chair of finance too by the way we should have some confidence in local government be able to undertake infrastructure project because be it not for the glc and as well actually build the thames barrier most member here would be swim that show what local government can do we decry local government too often deal with developer throughout that process and can say that have deal with some good developer and also some atrocious one often they do not deliver and often they do let we down and that be why new clause be so important it merely ask for measure to be put in place during the planning process before development be properly allow to go ahead in other word the mitigation be there deal have be do in my constituency such as section deal that have not really stand up and the developer have walk away leave we to clear up the mess new clause table by the hon member for south leicestershire alberto costa who be not in the chamber at present draw attention to classic example of what almost constitute betrayal on the part of developer who come along develop the site take the profit and walk away in many instance our local council do not even have the financial resource to challenge they legally for that reason be also attract to new clause which say if developer have let you down in that way do not give they any more planning permission it give the authority the responsibility of say no more you be not go to do that to we ever again in our area we will if we be serious have to go for compulsory purchase order amendment would take hope value out of the cpo calculation which be significant because in the past too many compulsory purchase have fail because developer have apply hope value which have escalate the cost and prevent we from acquire property wish to speak about my new clause to the bill concentrate entirely on remove perceive barrier to development unfortunately in the government view those turn out to be nature and the general public and to that end the bill propose huge reduction in the ability of local resident and councillor to make their voice hear or to have any meaningful influence over outcome that be such pity because gain consent be not an impossibility neighbourhood plan be introduce under the coalition government do well they represent the good version of local knowledge and local wish but there be not so much as single mention of they in the entire bill nothing could reveal more effectively how far the government focus be from the view of local resident who be to be treat as hostile who must on no account be allow to have their say for that reason have table new clause which would require neighbourhood plan to be take into account in decision making otherwise be not sure why they exist at all have also table new clause and which be direct at the need for local infrastructure new housing development come with two key promise that it will bring affordable home for local people and that the extra fund it bring will mean more civic amenity both these promise be routinely break for the last decade the pace of house building have be rapid in my constituency resident have be ask to support large scale development because they have be tell it will bring new school and clinic along with it in reality they have see the house build but not the service why do that keep happen people usually blame greedy developer but the real fault usually lie with the government incredibly although school may in good faith be write into local plan sign and seal via section agreement that guarantee nothing when the time come to build the school the department for education will often withdraw its support and no dfe support mean no school similarly an apparently solid commitment to build new gp surgery be so many empty word if the integrate care board later decide that it do not want to staff it as budget pressure increase year on year government body will decide that it be cheap to cram more child into exist school and more patient into exist clinic than it be to add new one unfortunately the bill do little to fix those problem every time the government mention support infrastructure it turn out that they mean big national infrastructure that be important too but it do not solve local problem the government be view this problem through urban eye urban centre usually already have sufficient infrastructure in place but in rural area such as horsham settlement be literally double in size but with the same level of service as former local councillor have experience at first hand how hard it be to shape development to meet local need when plan authority lack control over so many of the essential factor no wonder resident object to new housing when all they see be more strain on service that be already at break point hope the minister will support my amendment they be intend to improve this bill not to sabotage it local participation be not something to be fear rather it should be embrace be pleased to be member of the public bill committee and welcome the opportunity to speak in favour of the bill will also speak to clause and and to new clause and amendment which worry will far frustrate the planning process the opposite of what the bill try to achieve as the member of parliament for barking see and hear at first hand the impact of the housing crisis as other do in their constituency every week meet constituent who share with their personal and desperate story about overcrowding year spend in temporary accommodation poor quality housing and sky high rent let say this about hope hope be demonstrate through the action of government who be commit to deliver million home and who will tackle the housing crisis challenge that have be absolutely ignore for decade after decade supply be one of the fundamental reason why community like mine be face housing crisis our planning system be hinder supply in housing market that be already experience huge demand it be planning system that too often block or delay the necessary infrastructure that would support new home be build particularly as overall business case for house building be intrinsically link to infrastructure delivery on second reading speak about the pre application consultation requirement for nsip like other have previously highlight the low thames crossing so will not repeat that example but it be really important that member keep in mind the amount of money that be waste through such process that be why be pleased that my hon friend the minister consider representation make by and other in respect of reform the pre application procedure specifically welcome clause alongside government amendment and and new clause and which remove the statutory requirement to consult as part of the pre application stage for nsip application the change will mean that delay be reduce and essential infrastructure be consent to fast that will save up to month from the pre application stage and million if not billion of pound it could make the difference between whether an infrastructure proposal be viable or not and between whether home be build in an area or not to be clear that do not mean that applicant will avoid duty to consult as the minister outline in his statement to the house on april local community and local authority will still be able to object to application provide evidence of any adverse impact and have their say as part of the post submission nsip process as vice president of the local government association and former council leader understand all too well how important it be that local people have voice but also understand that national housing crisis need national solution and this bill be an important step in try to achieve that at the heart of the debate be recognition that the housing crisis can not be solve by individual local politician seek to gain political favour by campaign against new home in their area know how difficult it be for local authority to develop and agree local plan but we can not have situation in which even though of planning decision be currently make by planning officer key project that would see infrastructure deliver in this country be hold up as be the thousand if not million of home that we need to deliver absolutely support this important bill and look forward order rise to speak to number of the amendment before we spend lot of time with colleague on the public bill committee and some of the amendment be very good and some be not so good will try to rattle through as many as can support new clause which stand in the name of my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds our village should have the same protection as our town village have unique character across all our constituency and be privileged to represent six of they brickendon hertford heath great amwell stanstead abbotts st margarets and goffs oak have see local council that have build probably too much development in village and have see that change the fundamental character of goffs oak we should be try to protect that character because when people move to village they do so for the rural way of life and their unique character and identity we should stop urban sprawl and we should stop village link together support new clause because we should not be put solar farm on all our agricultural land across the country do mind about that even if it be only as the minister and number of labour members have make be too much of course support solar panel but why not put they on the roof of new house and factory hon member we be they be not do not see the government come forward to support the sunshine bill the new homes solar generation bill which be private member bill about put solar panel on new house so we will not take any lecture from the labour party on that fully support amendment and be surprised that the government be not support it they have make number of announcement about brownfield first so why have they not put that in legislation why do they not accept this amendment and put that in the bill if they be so determined to protect our green belt be hesitant about say that because do not think they be determined to protect it do not think the government care about the green belt in this country because if they do they would amend the bill to safeguard the green belt and make development brownfield first also support new clause and have speak number of time about development particular in my constituency of broxbourne as several member have say development come forward particularly under outline planning permission paint in gold as have say before there be to be new school new gp surgery new road park lot of community facility and lot of community money but they be change completely in the full planning application because the developer have take away all the infrastructure and there be no new gp surgery no new school no new infrastructure and no new community facility new clause would go some way to make the infrastructure first which be what our resident want when planning permission be grant it be easy for we as politician to support it and to get our resident more in favour of it if the infrastructure be go to come first if our constituent see hundred of new home build with no infrastructure particular no new gp surgery that be when they get really feed up would also like to support new clause which be about plant tree along highway think plant tree next to the highway make street beautiful and make place where people want to live this government be focus only on build million home which do not think they will do they be not focus on design make the community of the future and make community liveable my hon friend be make wonderful point about the new clause have table do he agree with that this be about improve our environment and reduce pollution and we need to think about all of that when we consider this bill thank my hon friend for that intervention and of course agree she make an important point and fully support her new clause know she be keen advocate for this provision in her constituency it be about create community as have say this government be interested only in hit national target which and lot of expert in the industry do not think they will meet the government need to think about how they be go to create the community of the future and the place where people want to live that mean design they to be really nice get developer around the table and agree design code and make sure developer really put their money where their mouth be we should ensure we have tree line street because when we go out in our constituency as be sure you do in yours madam deputy speaker tree line street be absolutely beautiful to walk down it be so much well for the people live there and everybody in the constituency if we make that reality for lot of our resident rather than just focus on build set number of house we should focus on create the community of the future and the place where our constituent want to live rise to speak in favour of amendment and new clause which be both table by my hon friend the member for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff commend he for his work on the bill believe the government have get it wrong with their change to nature protection appreciate that ministers will say that they come from genuine desire to address the housing crisis but the bill remove the foundation of our nature law include the mitigation hierarchy that require developer to avoid harm nearly every major conservation group oppose the bill and the government watchdog the office for environmental protection say that it degrade nature protection amendment offer practical improvement ensure that environmental delivery plan achieve their stated purpose of make developer pay to offset damage to nature it ensure that plan result in an improvement to the specific feature be harm so that the bill do not give green light to degrade irreplaceable habitat the wild justice lost nature report which be produce by team include my excellent constituent sarah postlethwaite reveal that housing developer be frequently fail on their legally bind ecological commitment its survey of new housing development include two in my constituency show that only half the ecological enhancement promise include hedgehog highway bird box bat box and plant tree be actually be deliver do my hon friend agree that while trust developer promise we must take up front step to empower and expand natural england and other authority to hold they to account yes wholeheartedly agree amendment also mandate that improvement be deliver before harm occur without that we risk specie be push close to extinction before their habitat be replace bad of all the bill still will not deliver the affordable home we desperately need the explanatory statement to amendment state this amendment would require environmental delivery plan to set out timetable for and thereafter report on conservation measure and require improvement of the status before development take place in area where natural england think there could be harm how long do my hon friend think that that would take in the case of nutrient neutrality and developer who want to build new social home do not have specific answer to that point can not give my hon friend an answer to that the government own impact assessment provide no datum that environmental protection be blocker nature in the bill be be scapegoate to distract from break developer lead model we have hear lot about the failure of developer to build infrastructure protect nature and provide enough social housing do that not just show that the status quo be break and why the bill be so important and head in the right direction the current system be break absolutely but do not think that hard press planning officer be the problem think developer be the problem and that be the point that be come on to make last year less than of new home be social rent deliver through the planning system private developer prioritise maximum profit with high end luxury build particularly in constituency such as mine at the current rate we would need to build over million home to deliver just social rent property yet there be over million people on waiting list that be why sign new clause to introduce bind quota for affordable and social rent home if we be serious as believe labour be about get family out of temporary accommodation and off waiting list local authority need the power and funding to lead new generation of council house building we also can not ignore the fact that the developer lead model create conflict with nature as under resource council be force to accept whatever site developer propose regardless of how suitable or unsuitable they be for sustainable development there be no amount of kill badger or red tape bonfire that will fix that it be too simplistic to argue that this be debate of builder versus blocker the overwhelming majority of planning application be approve which be why we have more than million planning permission approve in the past decade that have yet to be build developer continue to drip feed development into the system prioritise property that maximise profit and be far from affordable for local people it be time therefore to move away from the fail market dogma and believe to return to labour value the post war labour government build million of home support by the planning system our party create and it be time we do it again rise to speak to new clause in my name and to add my support for new clause on solar and battery energy storage system and new clause on solar new clause seek to prohibit the development of battery energy storage system on high quality agricultural land in debate on this topic in this chamber just last week we hear from my hon friend the member for south northamptonshire sarah bool that there be gw of battery capacity that be either operational await construction have receive planning permission or await consideration which be equal to supply million time the number of house we actually have this be ludicrous there be numerous question over safety fire risk accessibility and proximity to home and community yet these storage system be replace land that could be use for crop and graze for animal with metal container eat into our national food security at time that we should be increase food security and strengthen our food chain farmland as we all know in this place be irreplaceable when it be go it be go we be see far too many planning application come forward that would risk green belt land be trash with the term grey belt use to create grey area that planning inspector will take advantage of hope the government be listen to this point and those make by other on solar as well in the time have want to support number of other new clause and amendment that know matter to my constituent such as new clause on the duty to co operate it be not that we do not expect to have target in constituency such as mine we just do not expect to do all the heavy lifting we do not expect to have to pick up the can and let fail authority such as labour lead birmingham off the hook the council certainly can not manage birmingham bin and it can not manage its housing either three year on none of the property in the commonwealth village in perry barr have be let it can not be right that housing target in area like birmingham and london be be place on authority such as walsall where our target be be hike up not least when evidence point to more people want to live in town and centre surely what we should be do be regenerate these area and building on our brownfield if we do it sensibly it will protect the green belt protect our environment and protect the green and open space that we all love and enjoy will also speak in support of new clause on intentional unauthorised development something that really irk some of my constituent they write to and come to see about developer or individual who flagrantly breach or ignore planning regulation or permission create misery for their neighbour how can someone simply get away with do that sort of thing without repercussion when other abide by the rule and be leave pick up the piece have already speak of my support for new clause on prevent the merging of village that be crucial to constituency like mine which be on the edge of birmingham and have community that be at risk of be consume into its urban sprawl finally there be so much could say on natural england worry that the government be give more power over plan to an unelected quango while take power away from local authority and councillor rise to speak to new clause in my name it would place clear environmental and climate duty on forestry england and its parent body the forestry commission that be simple but crucial step that be long overdue forestry england manage over hectare of land across england and with that come huge untapped potential estimate suggest that around hectare of ancient woodland and open habitat such as lowland heath could be restore restoration at that scale could deliver fifth of the government legally bind target to create or restore hectare of wildlife rich habitat as set out in the environment act that be massive opportunity that we can not afford to waste wonder whether my hon friend agree that new clause in my name would also enhance biodiversity simple act such as provide bird box and swift brick can enhance the environment in the way that my hon friend suggest absolutely we have see huge loss in biodiversity in this country as lord goldsmith minister in the former government say in the other place we be one of the most nature deplete country in the world make small change in planning law will increase biodiversity the duty on forestry england be simply too weak its only exist nature duty be the biodiversity duty update in the act but it be ineffective it require forestry england only to consider biodiversity not contribute to nature recovery that be not good enough it lack clarity enforceability and crucially any tie to our legally bind nature target as result economic interest too often take precedence forestry england continue in many case to prioritise commercial forestry over restore biodiverse habitat include area of ancient woodland there be no legal climate duty on it either its climate work while good be entirely at the whim of political feeling at any time this imbalance be root in history the forestry commission be set up in to promote timber production and that economic priority still dominate it be reinforce by the growth duty in the deregulation act which require the forestry commission and forestry england to have regard to economic growth however as the nature and climate crisis have worsen the law have fail to catch up the result be miss opportunity poor outcome and action that directly undermine government policy such as grant funding of invasive specie and the approval of development on deep peat let we look at the fact the target for restore damage ancient woodland be hectare year yet under the last government in just six hectare be restore that be indefensible new clause be straightforward cost effective fix it would rebalance the scale and give forestry england proper legal duty to contribute to nature recovery and climate goal in way that be in line with the government target that mean no more miss change just clear accountability well outcome and well value for public money urge the minister to look at new clause and consider give forestry england the clear mandate that it need in order to deliver for people nature and the climate rise to support new clause build large scale solar farm on productive agricultural land be short sighted the propose maen hir project class as nationally significant infrastructure project will cover over acre of agricultural land on ynys môn this be not just any land it be land that sustain rural livelihood and underpin the economic and cultural identity of the island let we not forget why ynys môn be know as môn mam cymru the mother of wales our island have long be the breadbasket of the nation play key role in food production this land be not just soil it be security replace it with solar panel serve developer not community the climate crisis will make suitable agricultural land scarcer which make protect what we have now even more important once such land be lose to development we will not get it back that be not sustainability but short term gain at long term cost we see serious inconsistency in how planning policy be apply in wales under the planning process good quality agricultural land be consider for small scale development but when it come to large scale nsips such as maen hir those protection seem to vanish the contradiction between welsh and uk government policy be unacceptable there must be level playing field regardless of the scale of proposal we have already feel the impact of energy insecurity in recent year let we not repeat the same mistake with food security ask the government to rethink their approach to protect our agricultural land our economy and our community and to support new clause rise to speak in support of new clause in my name it seek to encourage great focus on the delivery of affordable housing through rural exception site table it to prompt further consideration of the role that this policy can play in address the urgent need for affordable home in rural community as many who represent area with significant rural population will know we have serious housing problem waiting list grow fast in rural area than anywhere else and young people be force out of village and town by the lack of affordable housing parent face old age without the comfort of their child nearby pub post office and shop start to struggle for lack of customer those business close and small village and the whole community feel the damage rural exception site which be usually find on the outskirt of small settlement offer modest but vital solution develop for the provision of affordable housing to those with connection to the area they help sustain local economy retain local people and skill and keep family together because they adjoin village development take place on gently human scale house radiate out from historical core respect the historical and rural situation these be not soulless disconnected housing estate this be development on scale that ensure that affordable housing be weave into the fabric of our community not add on it preserve and recreate the social mix once typical of our town where as nye bevan remember the doctor the grocer the butcher and farm labourer all live in the same report march vol that sort of community be now an exception but let we reform rural exception site and offer route back to that ideal despite the potential the rural exception site regime be alarmingly underuse out of local authority in the country only use rural exception site to deliver affordable home in thank the hon member for st ives andrew george who be not in his place although he be here for most of the afternoon for his support for my new clause cornwall lead the country by example of what be deliver on rural exception site across the whole of england be in cornwall and to of housing deliver in cornwall be through rural exception why do we not equip other area across the country include my county of suffolk to do the same increase awareness and engagement will double the output of affordable housing on such site so let we encourage officer and local authority across the country to take much close look at the guidance that will give we new engagement strategy for delivery partner who will work with the local community and landowner which will be crucial by give rural exception site the prominence they deserve in planning we increase the supply of affordable home but maintain the unique character and spirit of our rural community be hearten to read in the government response to the consultation on the revise national planning policy framework that further consideration be indeed be give to exception as means of support rural affordable house that be welcome and be optimistic about the potential for rural exception site to be bring forward in much great number deliver small scale affordable housing that be crucial to ensure that the english countryside have vibrant and inclusive community for generation to come let we put the life back into the heart of rural england love tree which be why rise to support new clause table in my name be sure that all of we in this house recognise the value of tree not just their ecological importance but the character and beauty that they bring to our community and high street hope that can demonstrate why amend the rule to allow for sensible guidance on planting tree can help to liberate local authority from their default over cautious position and kick start tree plant revolution new clause seek to remove some of the ambiguity and misconception surround the regulation of tree plant along highway the highways act include provision for local authority to maintain free flow road but those provision can and have be misinterpret to block tree planting in particular the licensing rule establish in section of the act should be relax to make it easy for local resident to plant tree too often even well mean council impose unrealistic demand in windsor and maidenhead for example individual plant tree must pay between and in administrative fee and secure million in public liability insurance hardly encouraging hampshire county council strict interpretation of section have lead to one metre buffer around utility block many ideal planting site despite minimal risk to those service let briefly touch on the environmental case woodland trust report the benefit to people of tree outside wood find that roadside tree be highly effective at capture pollutant especially important give that traffic be major source of air pollution in the uk study by lancaster university even show that plant silver birch on terrace street reduce harmful particulate matter inside nearby home by more than tree also play critical role in support biodiversity common roadside specie such as lime and flower cherry tree be not only beautiful but vital for pollinator help to maintain healthy ecosystem cheshire be proud dairy and beef farming county we have some of the most carbon efficient cow in the world and we should be proud of that record but if we can far improve our environmental impact that can only be good thing in rural area have tree line road can help to reduce ammonium level and impact on habitat and the surround environment again placement of tree matter have more tree near semi natural habitat that need protection have great impact than have more tree in establish woodland of course safety must remain priority and not every road be suitable for tree planting but where space and condition allow tree can improve road safety study have show that tree line street feel narrow naturally encourage driver to reduce their speed there be many more benefit that could speak to such as improve soil quality but time be short so will finish by touch on the aesthetic benefit of tree near highway they really do make difference they stand the test of time they add character to the area they take on cultural significance and they improve our mental health our perception and our appreciation of the area in which we live by amend this bill through new clause hope we can empower local authority to plant the right tree in the right area where there be local support and be confident that we will notice the benefit of do so be privileged to be member of the bill committee start the committee as supporter of this legislation and rise to speak now as an equally strong supporter of it many of my constituent in dartford be also extremely strong supporter of change their town be regularly paralyse by overspill traffic from the overloaded dartford crossing that have be an issue for decade the need for new crossing be first suggest as long ago as the yet despite route have be agree in development consent be grant only this year hundred of million have be spend on the process so far strongly support the measure to streamline the nsip regime and give more certainty on large and much need project such as the low thames crossing mention by my hon friend the member for milton keynes north chris curtis this bill will make change to dramatically improve the situation and that fact must not be lose as we debate the amendment today want to speak briefly to three of the new clause that feel strongly about cover net zero sustainability and the social content of new development number of proposal have be table include new clause by my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner and other on the issue of swift brick that be another issue that be discuss at some length in committee and member across the house recognise that we must do more to support vital specie such as swift welcome the step that have already be take by the house building industry on this issue with voluntary standard sign up to by home builder account for home year commit to bird nesting brick or box be instal for every new home build as well as hedgehog highway as standard for every new development hope that ministers will monitor the effectiveness of this voluntary measure and look at what further step might be take in future also support the sentiment in new clause table by the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos that would require new home to be build to net zero carbon building standard and include provision for the generation of solar power hope however that he will welcome the announcement by the secretary of state for energy security and net zero on friday that the future home standard when publish later this year will require all new home with small number of exception to include solar panel not everything we want to see happen need to be include on the face of the bill want to finish by speak in favour of new clause table by my hon friend the member for bournemouth east tom hayes this would require local authority to assess local play provision and to take reasonable step to improve play sufficiency as other member have mention hundred of playground have be lose over the past decade and half speak to any young parent and they will tell you the value of play especially outdoor play where their child can meet and play safely with other young child hope that ministers will see the strength of feeling on this issue and whether they accept this new clause or not do more to help create space to play for family across the country notwithstanding the amendment and new clause that have be discuss tonight be proud to have help move this vital piece of legislation nearer the statute book and look forward to the bill help to get britain build again will get straight to the point there be two big problem with this bill first there be no social housing target which mean that it do not do anything to secure delivery of the fit for the future social rent housing that we so desperately need as colleague across the house have say tonight secondly it roll back vital nature protection effectively give developer carte blanche to bulldoze nature to build luxury home that be accessible only to the rich green mp give the bill chance on second reading will the hon lady give way be sorry will not give way because there be so many colleague who still want to speak and we be short of time green mp give the bill chance on second reading because secure home be out of reach for too many people rent be spiral over child be live in temporary accommodation and over million people be stick on housing waiting list it be scandalous that just of the housing build in the last decade be for social rent and there be now wait of more than year for family sized social home serve on the bill committee for the past six plus week and work hard to persuade the government to fix the serious flaw in the bill but unfortunately those call have so far be ignore be profoundly concerned that in the glare absence of social rent housing target this government be write charter for developer greed that be why green party mp have table new clause to push for safe warm home in the community we love at truly affordable price it would require housing plan to set target for build zero carbon social rent housing base on local need because without an explicit social housing commitment big developer will be able to line their pocket even far while ordinary people be still lock out of afford decent home be hugely concerned as be so many people and the nature organisation that we all trust by the way the bill roll back nature protection that be why have propose amendment to which would delete part of the bill entirely because the government repeatedly block cross party effort in committee to amend part to reduce its harmful impact on nature part be harmful for three key reason first it weaken and undermine the requirement for nature protection to be achieve to high level of scientific certainty secondly it create pay to pollute system allow developer to skip straight to offset trash the long establish principle of the mitigation hierarchy that is that development should first seek to avoid harm thirdly it upend the requirement for compensation to be deliver up front and create wiggle room for developer to avoid pay the true cost of the harm they do the government know the nature crisis in our country be severe yet they repeatedly vote in committee to reject raft of constructive amendment to improve part and ensure win win for housing and nature remind the house that the labour party manifesto point out that the conservatives have leave britain one of the most nature deplete country in the world but part will make that terrible situation bad it be not just the nature organisation that tell we that it be the independent expert advice of the office for environmental protection which say that the bill constitute regression in environmental law directly contradict the assertion of the secretary of state if minister insist on bulldoze ahead on part urge they at the very least to accept my new clause with cross party support and wide backing it seek to match the current degree of certainty for environmental protection also strongly support amendment in the name of the hon member for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff which would ensure that improvement be deliver before the damage they be compensate for we can and must both protect nature and build warm affordable zero carbon social rent home the government say it be what they want sadly it be not what the bill deliver without urgent change order call alex brewer the planning system certainly need change but local people know their area which be why local planning authority must retain their current power as outline in amendment as we have hear each area be different in my constituency we be fortunate to have the loddon and whitewater chalk stream river nurture ecosystem and sustain biodiversity the labour manifesto promise more high quality well design and sustainable home create place that increase climate resilience and promote nature recovery chalk stream in this country be at risk third be over abstract third fail their phosphorus target and third fail their fish and plant assessment only have any form of protection we can not rely on the local nature recovery strategy or the national planning policy framework to protect those ecosystem these river need bespoke national protection write into primary legislation in this house as outline in amendment we can not make reparation after the fact once chalk aquifer be destroy they can not be replace when we say irreplaceable we mean it the government also say they want to make the uk clean energy superpower my colleague and be thrilled that the liberal democrats call for solar panel on new home be finally be implement solar power be key way to harness the power of the natural environment as we develop infrastructure for our community support new clause and put solar panel on all new car park would be the natural next step in the right direction electric vehicle be key to achieve energy independence but charge inequality be simply hold we back undermine net zero and energy security do my hon friend agree that local authority must be empower to approve safe cross pavement charging solution without expensive and time consume street work licence or planning application absolutely agree with my hon friend on those policy solar panel do not just soak up the sun and create clean energy they also provide shade protect vehicle and frankly over car park they look quite good while they be do it we should be prioritise solar panel on the hectare of rooftop and car park across the country not on our precious green space car park be often locate in energy intensive area near hospital shopping centre and office building so it make perfect sense to generate the power right next to where it be need do the hon lady agree that car park and rooftop might be good place for solar but this country prime agricultural land be not we must find the right balance between agriculture and renewable energy france have already take the lead by mandate that all car park with more than space must be cover with solar panel the bill be the right place for we to implement similar clause solar photovoltaic produce about time more energy per square kilometre than biomass solar be efficient clean and ready to go be highly concerned that the bill be overcommitte to biomass which be not form of renewable energy in britain we have the knowledge and expertise to develop new housing energy and infrastructure with nature in mind the government be treat this issue as an either or but we could and should be much more ambitious and have both rise to speak in support of my new clause and amendment to which aim to tackle the grow electric vehicle charge divide an issue that be not only about infrastructure but about fairness affordability and climate action nearly four out of every household in the uk do not have driveway for many of they the transition to evs remain challenge because bureaucratic barrier mean that they face charge cost that be time more expensive compare with those who can charge their car at home today someone with driveway can charge their ev overnight for as little as per kilowatt hour but driver without one may be force to pay up to at public charger that mean over more per year and renter resident of terrace home and low income family bear the brunt my amendment would cut unnecessary red tape and enable local authority to approve safe cross pavement charging solution without expensive and time consume street work licence or planning application they would give council control while empower resident to take part in the ev transition that be vital step in close the gap between those who can charge affordably at home and those who can not it would help to reduce reliance on overstretch public charger support grid resilience and build confidence in the ev transition while unlock green job and cut emission this be also an issue of energy security sky high energy and fuel bill be hurt family and business fuel the cost of living crisis russia assault on ukraine have reinforce the need to significantly reduce the uk dependence on fossil fuel and to invest in renewable both to cut energy bill and to deliver energy security electric vehicle can help million of family to avoid petrol premium save on travel cost and strengthen our national security and independence if we be serious about hit net zero clean our air and reduce the cost of living we must make ev adoption genuinely accessible and affordable option for everyone not just for those with driveway urge member to support my common sense future face amendment and new clause rise to speak to my amendment to and to highlight the importance of new clause and if have my amendment seek to correct clear oversight in the legislation by extend the energy bill discount to those who live near energy generation site rather than simply to those who live near energy transmission site why be it that those who have pylon build near their home be compensate while those who have solar farm such as the propose green hill development near grendon easton maudit and bozeat in my constituency be not that arbitrary distinction expose the government proposal as not only inconsistent but fundamentally unfair such disparity understandably rile resident who must live cheek by jowl with solar farm by simply extend the energy bill discount the government would at least put an arm around those who bear the burden and would encourage community to embrace renewable encourage the minister to take that forward but will not hold my breath new clause and be essential the number of propose battery energy storage system be if member will pardon the pun explode they should not be build on high quality agricultural land the government say repeatedly that food security be national security but any plan that take agricultural land out of produce food lead the government and this country down very dangerous path we must encourage and incentivise farmer to do exactly that farm the government be create an either or situation by allow battery energy storage system and solar on high quality agricultural land urge member to support these new clause new clause propose by my hon friend the member for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson would prevent local planning authority from allow development on functional floodplain visit far too many home in my constituency last year that be devastate by flooding by develop on these know site we be sleepwalk into crisis home will be devastate with homeowner find their home uninsurable and there will be risk to life the government be exacerbate the problem of flooding under this bill on point of order madam deputy speaker my understanding be that it be hop that new clause have be select to be call for separate decision of the house my concern be that the house will be deny the ability to have that separate decision thank the right hon member for his point of order he will know that the member who put forward the amendment have the right to withdraw it and have indicate that they will do so it be at the chair discretion whether separate decision be call for and in this case it be my understanding that the amendment be not go to be move far to that point of order madam deputy speaker my understanding be that the member should shout and make it clear on the floor of the house that he do not wish the amendment to be put to the vote so that member can voice their opinion thank the right hon member for his further point of order if do not call the member to move his amendment and it be not my intention to do so there will be no separate decision far to that point of order madam deputy speaker interruption be entitle to raise point of order appreciate your ruling on this matter madam deputy speaker but ask for clarification because it be my understanding that if we have be inform that an amendment be for separate decision the chair ask the member whose amendment it be whether they want to withdraw it with the leave of the house and have never see that question not be put on the floor of the house thank the hon member for that point of order it be simply not the case that it have to be withdraw on the floor of the house this have happen on numerous occasion call the minister it be pleasure to rise to respond to what have be very comprehensive debate interruption significant number of amendment have be speak to in the course of the order the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson should not be shout at the clerks in that way have make my point call the minister significant number of amendment have be speak to in the course of the debate and the house will appreciate that do not have the time to address the vast majority of they will therefore focus on address as many of the key amendment and point of contention as can have be extremely generous in give way in open the debate but hope that hon member will now appreciate that to get through as many point as possible will not be take further intervention the debate this evening have evidence support from across the house for nature and for ensure we get the nature restoration fund right speak in detail about the government position in open the debate as repeatedly make clear in the bill committee and will reiterate this evening we be listen to the concern raise by hon member and stakeholder we be clear that this be the right model to take we forward we be of course open to way to improve the legislation however and on that basis and to emphasise the point make early in the debate we be give serious consideration to way in which we might instil further confidence that part will deliver the outcome we believe it will such as provide great confidence in the rigour of the overall improvement test as raise by the oep and the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos we be also give due consideration to how we can provide for great certainty in the timescale for deliver conservation measure as raise by my hon friend the member for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff as well as seek to clarify the evidential basis and environmental rationale for strategic conservation measure as raise by my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins the status quo be not work the case for move to more strategic approach be compelling and look forward to further consideration of part in the other place turn to the important issue of child play area and play field thank the hon member for taunton and wellington for table new clause and my hon friend the member for bournemouth east tom hayes for table new clause particularly commend my hon friend on all that he be do to make the case for high quality accessible and inclusive area for play the government agree that access to play space be vital which be why strong protection be already in place the national planning policy framework be clear that local planning policy should be base on robust and up to date assessment of the need for open space sport and recreation facility and opportunity for new provision include place for child play in december we strengthen the strong protection already in place in the nppf by add explicit reference to safeguard formal play space that mean that those facility can be lose only where they be no long need or where there be justified and appropriate alternative give the exist policy expectation safeguard and source of support we do not believe that it be necessary to add the sort of legislative requirement the amendment would entail however recognise the importance of what the amendment seek to achieve and the provision of play space be one of the area we be consider as we prepare new set of national planning policy for decision making on which we will consult this year commit to my hon friend the member for bournemouth east to write to my counterpart at the department for education and at the department for culture media and sport to ensure that we be act across government to increase space for play will work with he to broker the necessary ministerial meeting that he seek with those assurance hope that he and the hon member for taunton and wellington will feel able to withdraw their amendment turn to swift brick which be mention several time during the debate we recognise that they be vital mean of arrest the long term decline of the breeding swift population while swift brick coverage be increase with nearly house builder have make voluntary commitment to install one for every new home build the government want to do more to drive up swift brick installation however there be principled difference of opinion as to the good way to achieve that objective although understand why many be attract to the argument that the only way to make significant difference to swift number and other red list specie be to mandate the incorporation of swift brick into all new build property through building regulation or free stand legislation take different view in all sincerity do not believe that amend building regulation be the most appropriate way to secure the outcome that the house as whole seek as building regulation be mandatory go down that route would compel developer to install swift brick in all new building irrespective of what they be or where they be locate on that point will the minister give way no will not contrary to what hon member might assume amend building regulation be not quick fix it can take year for change to feed through into building design and we do not think that swift can afford to wait that long for those and other reason remain of the view that change national planning policy be the more effective route to secure swift brick as standard feature of the vast majority of new building as the house will be aware the revise nppf publish in december expect development to incorporate feature that support priority or threaten specie such as swift bat and hedgehog however as have make clear to many hon member over recent month we have always intend to go far we be specifically give consideration to use new suite of national policy for decision make to require swift brick to be incorporate into new building unless there be compelling reason that preclude their use or that would make they ineffective that would significantly strengthen the planning policy expectation already in place so that for example we would expect to see at least one swift brick in all new brick build house believe that be the good way we can achieve the objective of see swift brick use as widely as possible as the use and placement of swift brick can be integrate into the planning process and become standard expectation in the design of new development we will be consult on new set of national policy for decision making later this year so that no one can be in any doubt about our intention here the government have today publish new planning practice guidance set out how swift brick be expect to be use in new development as an interim step ahead of the plan consultation we also hear from several hon member who want to see strong protection put in place for chalk stream the measure in the bill will not weaken exist protection for those valuable area for nature but the government continue to give careful consideration to this matter in the context of ongoing reform to national planning policy and be more than happy to engage with hon member from across the house on it turn to new clause table by the hon member for taunton and wellington which would have the effect of prevent the government from implement national scheme of delegation for plan committee put simply it be wreck amendment and the government can not accept it for the follow reason planning be principally local activity and the government recognise the vital role that plan committee play however we must ensure that they operate as effectively as possible at present every council have its own scheme of delegation and of planning decision in england be already make by planning officer however there be significant variation across the country which create risk and uncertainty in the system as such we believe that there be robust case for introduce national scheme of delegation since committee stage when we debate these issue at length the government have publish technical consultation set out our detailed plan for reform in this area encourage hon member to read that consultation in which we propose splitting planning application into two tier provide certainty about what decision will be delegate to expert officer and at the same time ensure that councillor can continue to focus on the most significant proposal for housing and commercial development to allow for effective local and democratic oversight of the most controversial application where warrant believe that if member engage with the detail of that conversation they will recognise that what be be propose be not an attempt to ride roughshod over local democracy but sensible and proportionate change design to improve certainty and decision making in the planning system however on the fundamental point of whether we should introduce national scheme of delegation the government position be an unequivocal yes for that reason can not accept the new clause in question turn briefly to the amendment table by my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier and the hon member for taunton and wellington relate to the bill new reflective amendment procedure for national policy statement reassure the house that our change be not about erode parliamentary scrutiny but about ensure that scrutiny be proportionate to the change be make and we absolutely recognise the value that such scrutiny bring to get important change right as have discuss with my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch several safeguard be in place that will ensure parliamentary oversight be protect will happily restate they for the record where we intend to make reflective amendment statement will be lay in parliament announce review and we will write to the relevant select committee minister will make themselves available to speak to that committee as far as be practicable and we will take into account the view of any select committee report publish during the consultation period let be very clear in response the government recognise the importance of ministers attend committee to explain the propose change and be happy to tell my hon friend that the deputy prime minister and will write to colleague to ensure that be fully and clearly understand importantly the npps as amend must be lay in parliament for day during which time this house may resolve that the amendment should not be proceed with parliament retain the ultimate say over whether change should be enact hope that clarify the process and reassure my hon friend and the house more widely finally will address some of the amendment about provision of affordable and social housing include new clause and table by my hon friend the members for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff and for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi the government be commit to the big generational uplift in social and affordable housing and in our first month in office we have put our money where our mouth be we have announce new million in year funding to top up the affordable home programme and we announce in the spring statement an immediate injection of billion in new capital investment to act as bridge to the future grant programme which be to be announce this week in the spending review to date we have not choose to define target for social and affordable housing and there be good reason why that be the case include the fact that the sector have face significant financial constraint and need regulatory certainty that be make bad by many of the completely irresponsible and unacceptable decision make by the opposition when they be in government over the past year it would not be appropriate to set target until after the sector be stabilise know what be require and importantly be clear on what investment will be available to support delivery which will become apparent only after the spending review range of complex factor contribute to the number of affordable house come forward in this country and impact on the sector ability to build more home but we will of course keep that matter under review will very briefly mention the green belt and the protection of village as the house will be aware we recently publish guidance in relation to the green belt none of the long stand green belt purpose be touch by those change include the purpose of preclude the merging of town the guidance do not remove those appropriate and relevant protection from land around village and any green belt land include land in or near village that conflict with the relevant purpose would not be identify as grey belt to conclude once again thank all hon member who have participate in today debate for their contribution the government will continue to reflect on the argument that have be make urge the house to support the target amendment to this bill that the government have propose to ensure we can realise its full potential question put and agree to new clause accordingly read second time debate interrupt programme order this day the deputy speaker put forthwith the questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be conclude at that time standing order no new clause add to the bill new clause prohibition of solar development on high quality agricultural land no permission may be grant for the building or installation of provision for solar power generation where the development would involve the building on or development of agricultural land at grade or and building or installation at ground level paul holmes this new clause would prohibit the development of solar power generation on high quality agricultural land bring up question put that the clause be add to the bill shockat adam jim

east tom hayes whom will call my hon friend because he be my county neighbour would not move new clause to which be signatory mr speaker have say that the new clause would be subject to separate

description of breast cancer date back to beyond bc hippocrate describe the progressive stage of breast cancer in bc when he outline his theory for its cause although breast cancer mortality rate have be decrease since the approximately woman and man die of breast cancer every year that be death from breast cancer every single day of the week we all know someone who have be impact by breast cancer mother sister granny daughter colleague or friend for that be my nan the matriarch of the family character fit and healthy who go out daily to clean other people house we lose she when be year old she be too embarrassed to show her breast to her doctor and explain away her lump as an injury cause by fall off window ledge when clean window by the time she finally go to the doctor it be too late and she die month later we lose she too soon perhaps it be also fear that keep she away two of her sister be also take by breast cancer that be such familiar story so many woman be treat for breast cancer tell of family member aunt sister mother grandmother who have be through the same experience my nan be of jewish descent it be now know that jewish people of ashkenazi heritage have one in chance of carry the brca gene mutation which mean much high chance of develop breast cancer one in two chance before the age of for the sake of my family be currently have genetic screening to check that if it be the familial cause it have not be pass down urge every woman of jewish heritage to do the same screening be provide free by the nhs and can be do in the home medical testing of the gene be effective but polygenic risk factor mean that if someone have combination of gene they might be more at risk of breast cancer do my hon friend think we should be roll out polygenic risk testing so that with well understanding of their gene woman know how often they should have their breast check my hon friend make valuable point and hope that the minister have take heed of it be diagnose and go through the journey of early stage breast cancer during the covid pandemic do my hon friend agree that it be important that the system understand that breast cancer can present in young woman not just in old woman thank my hon friend for that point have sympathy for her experience and hope that she be now fully recover yes we must be conscious that woman of all age could have breast cancer and awareness must be raise so that woman continue to check their breast for it what do know be this breast cancer screening and early detection save life the early that breast cancer be detect the simple and more effective the treatment be likely to be between the age of and on three year cycle woman will get letter in the post invite they in for screen chance conversation last autumn with local gp alert to his concern that the number of woman attend bassetlaw hospital for screen appointment have drop dramatically ask the chief executive of our local hospital trust to investigate that and he quickly come back with some worrying figure show that attendance have drop in recent time to below of woman invite for screening this be either due to an appointment cancellation or no show on the day nhs england datum show that prior to the coronavirus pandemic of woman in bassetlaw and doncaster be go for screening the decline be dramatic and be not unique to bassetlaw commend the hon lady for bring this debate forward speak to she before the debate and her concern be those of we all and that be why we be here to try to make life well across england wales and northern ireland breast screen coverage remain relatively steady over time until at an average of but follow covid in breast screening coverage have decrease to by the covid impact on breast screening be entirely worrying as be the fact that most trust be not back to pre covid screen test rate do the hon lady agree that we need co ordinate approach throughout the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to enhance screening rate we look forward to hear the minister response thank the hon gentleman for his contribution and agree that it be worry that only half of the trust in england be meet the national target of of eligible woman go for their screening but next year we hit milestone in that it be estimate that almost million woman will be invite for screening welcome the fact that nhs england be actively encourage more woman to book and attend their screening will the minister provide more detail on that to be honest in bassetlaw can not wait for national operation to kick in last month launch the bassetlaw love your boob get they check campaign support local woman and encourage woman to go for their breast screening pay tribute to the wonderful bassetlaw woman who have be active in the campaign woman such as liz rew and maria charlesworth who find lump in their breast and go for their screening barbara baldwin and claire previn join my campaign as they have have friend take too soon by breast cancer do not want anyone else to have to go through that lynn dixon from bassetlaw have breast cancer in her family and be first diagnose at the age of after find lump and she have just recently find another lump and be screen this week she be face further treatment for breast cancer my thought and love be with lynn right now hon member hear hear jenny bailey be former nhs nurse and midwife in bassetlaw who have her breast cancer identify follow routine screening the woman from bassetlaw be amazing use their life experience to join the fighting spirit encourage their friend family and neighbour to get screen thank the hon lady very much for introduce this debate because it be so important could not agree more that screening be incredibly important but we also need to make sure that modern radiotherapy treatment be available for those whose breast cancer have be detect nhs england have degrade the availability of radiotherapy treatment in many region over the last year understand that breast cancer patient from bassetlaw have to travel over an hour as they do in my area to receive the radiotherapy that they need what might the hon lady say about the government new cancer plan hope it go long way to resolve the problem of get access to radiotherapy which be so effective welcome the hon member contribution woman in bassetlaw have to travel all the way to sheffield once they have be diagnose to have treatment and radiotherapy that be long journey and it would be well if the cancer could be treat in bassetlaw wait to hear how that can be achieve in future year because it be so important for people to be treat close to home thank my hon friend for introduce this debate she have mention several woman whom know personally have work with they and she be absolutely right that they be incredible particularly send my sympathy to lynn and her family we know that barrier to improve breast cancer screening rate include not only awareness but accessibility it be about people live in rural area be able to get to where treatment and screening can take place do my hon friend agree that the government need to think not only about treatment but about the way in which people access that treatment when they be in rural area like mine and hers thank my hon friend for his contribution and agree with he in bassetlaw we have single unit but there be mobile unit in rural area that might encourage well take up rate the misconception that only woman can get breast cancer be far too common almost man get breast cancer every year include my constituent danny emmerson from worksop who find some lump in his armpit while he be sit watch tv he go to his gp to get check and be quickly diagnose with breast cancer thank danny for join my campaign to raise awareness that man get breast cancer too my ask today be that everyone in the chamber man or woman check themselves and encourage their wife partner daughter granddaughter sister and all the woman in their life to attend their breast cancer screening appointment this debate be not the end of my campaign on june will be run the race for life in my constituency and visit the bassetlaw princess diana mammography unit to help tell the story of how easy it be for people to get their breast screen welcome the fact that my hon friend the members for doncaster central sally jameson and for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher be in their place the datum for doncaster and bassetlaw hospital cover all of our constituency while understand that we can presume that there be low attendance level by those who live in our more deprived ward will the minister provide advice on what more the department can do to ensure that we can get hospital specific datum for breast cancer screening uptake do my hon friend agree that be critical that we get datum at that level so that our doncaster and bassetlaw teaching hospital nhs foundation trust can target the area and perhaps even the age group in which woman take up be low agree with my hon friend we have datum but we remain unsure where the low uptake be would like to go to the ward in my area where uptake be low and knock on door to encourage woman to go to their screening so it would helpful to have precise datum from the two hospital in the doncaster and bassetlaw hospital trust several organisation across bassetlaw support people with cancer and wish to highlight the work of aurora in worksop which offer support to people during and after cancer treatment from exercise space to beauty treatment emotional support or even just cup of tea with friendly face and listening ear organisation like aurora in our constituency be the unsung hero for people go through the challenge that be cancer treatment congratulate my hon friend and neighbour on secure this important debate and on the campaign that she be lead on woman and man be screen for breast cancer early uptake be very low nationally which be problem in doncaster east and the isle of axholme incredible work be do by organisation like visit bawtry in october last year over organisation turn the town pink during breast cancer awareness month raise for breast cancer charity and most importantly amplify the message that it be important to get early detection to save life do my hon friend agree that effort by grassroots organisation be vital and that the government must support they as well as support improve screening access and public health messaging thank my hon friend for his comment and agree with he bawtry be just across the border from my constituency and it have very strong community when go to through these town see how many people come out on to the street to support one another so be sure that the campaign he mention be very strong have come across many charity and organisation work on this issue in my constituency they often involve people who have have breast cancer and who want to educate other woman and encourage they to be screen they be very important to the work that we be do since the beginning of breast screening check in there have be cut off age of my campaign include woman who be above the age threshold for be invite in for screening my nan be over when she be diagnose with breast cancer why do woman over have to rely on memory and phone call to get their screening appointment all woman can get breast cancer it do not discriminate by age or background thank bassetlaw woman sue shaw and barbara baldwin who be both over and be now miss out they argue that the cost of treatment for breast cancer far outweigh the cost of screening early prevention not only save life but save the nhs money they be call for the threshold to be eradicate that be their ask and mine of the minister as we have hear early diagnosis of breast cancer can save life and be do everything that can locally to encourage woman to attend their screening when they be invite my bassetlaw message be love your boob and get they check thank my hon friend the member for bassetlaw jo white for bring forward this debate on really important topic that be close to my heart and know the heart of so many other hon member it be really important to ensure that as many woman as possible take up the offer of screening they should not feel embarrassed to seek help if they feel something untoward when check their breast my hon friend have speak really eloquently and have be support by other colleague as she have do on other occasion she have highlight her family experience of lose love one due to the fear of seek medical advice and she be right to raise the issue of the downturn in woman choose to be screen in her constituency and sadly across the country survival rate for breast cancer can be good if breast cancer be find early at stage one the five year survival rate can be as high as but the five year survival rate plummet to when breast cancer be not find until stage four the early breast cancer be catch the early it can be treat and the more likely it be that the patient will recover everyone be encourage to check their breast for lump there have be some excellent public health campaign over the year from various charity explain what to look for be it lump discharge or dimpling of the skin on the breast if change be find it be essential that no time be waste before contact gp that be why screen be an essential tool in our arsenal when try to prevent this disease mammogram can identify breast cancer before it be large enough to be feel the nhs national breast cancer screen programme invite all woman age to to attend screening appointment once every three year mammograms can be uncomfortable as those of we who have have they know and many woman have anxiety about have to get undressed in front of stranger but that short discomfort could save life it be important that we encourage all woman not to put off their scan the nhs breast screening programme be badly affect by the pandemic as we have hear this evening screen for breast cancer be pause and when it restart the number of woman take up the offer do not recover to pre pandemic level even after the backlog of miss appointment have be clear the take up of invitation be low and datum indicate that lot of woman be still not come forward to start their screening journey the nhs be do more to help to drive up engagement and we can all do more to help as my hon friend be do the most recent nhs datum show that breast cancer screen uptake in the area include my hon friend constituency be report at with an achievable standard of that be high than the national average of but it be short of that achievable high standard also the percentage of woman screen within month of their previous screen be report at versus the acceptable standard of and the achievable standard of while more can clearly be do to increase uptake hope that those figure for the entire patch that include my hon friend constituency provide some reassurance that woman be come forward to be screen however absolutely take the point make by she and her colleague that the datum need to be understand at more granular local level particularly datum on the woman come forward in area of high deprivation will ensure that my hon friend have access to that information follow this debate be pleased that the doncaster and bassetlaw teaching hospital breast screening service have make significant improvement over the past year to improve attendance at appointment really commend my hon friend love your boob campaign and the work that she have highlight with local woman like as liz maria barbara claire and lynn and with man such as danny which make the point that be important that man also check the service have recently expand availability by offer more appointment outside traditional hour it have extend its clinic hour and have regular saturday appointment the invitation method have also be change from open appointment to time and date appointment which have be show to help increase engagement and the service have meet with the cancer alliance and commissioner to review way of increase uptake understand
