be unable to be present today because he be attend his father funeral have the privilege of serve with doug hoyle in this house from until and he be an exemplar for back bench activity during that time our sympathy be very much with mr speaker turn to the amendment and particularly new clause thank the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend the member for keighley robbie moore and my right hon friend the minister for food farming and fisheries with whom be privileged to have meeting last week to discuss my amendment they will have well understanding of the way work than quite lot of other colleague be pleased that as result of that meeting there be essentially an agreement an acceptance that we must try to link communication about the appalling incident of pet abduction or theft to the need for people to microchip their loved animal particularly dog and cat in the course of that discussion it be point out by the minister of state that before the bill be to become law it will be necessary for guidance to be discuss with the crown prosecution service regard exactly what the enforcement provision would be hope that in respond to this debate my right hon friend will expand on that point follow that discussion think would table new clause about guidance so that any reference in the debate could include reference to the specific issue of guidance that would be issue follow the enactment of the bill would like that guidance to set out clearly the position for people who do not microchip their cat and dog microchipping of dog be mandatory and have be since but we know that something between and of the million dog in this country be not microchippe in early june it will be mandatory for all cat to be microchippe and probably about have be microchippe by now hope that we can send out message in discuss this important legislation that if someone do not have their cat or dog microchippe they should not expect the law to rush to their assistance in the event of their cat or dog be abduct apart from anything else if they complain to the police that their dog or cat have be abduct and it have not be microchippe it be all the more difficult to identify it search for it and so on on that great principle of english equity it seem to that if someone seek the protection of the law they should come with clean hand in this context that mean they should be able to say that they have comply with the law in respect of the pet for which they have responsibility and have microchippe they hope people will realise that if they do not hope that the government will point this out in the guidance have their pet microchippe they will not be able to take advantage of the benefit and special provision in this legislation my hon friend be make fair point that if people want help when their dog have be steal they should have they properly chip in accordance with the regulation do not think puppy be include in that it be important that we think about the pet owner for whom we be try to get this bill through know that he be not seek in any way to block it but these people would almost certainly have comply with the law and understand that the amendment would make it far more difficult for the police while understand the sentiment hope he will not press this to division will hold my counsel on that until hear the minister response if say now that agree with the minister before he have even say anything would be close off an important option despite the temptation from my right hon friend will not do that she herself have say to in private that she think there be lot to be say for what be try to achieve on microchipping have specific amendment link microchippe to the text of the bill the guidance be perhaps another way of achieve the same objective my right hon friend remind that when the bill come out of committee it be originally put on the list of bills to be consider without debate on friday on the basis that everything that could have be say about it have already be say and it should now proceed directly to the statute book it be with wry amusement that see that my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth the promotor of the bill have now take advantage of the opportunity provide by have debate on report to put down her own amendment to the bill she could not have do that if her original intention of have the bill go through all remain stage on the nod have be implement hope she will thank for that since the bill be first produce the government have bring forward some important new measure relate to microchippe to deal with the problem of the conflicting or complementary microchipping database the pet theft taskforce be commission to look into these issue of pet abduction and it strongly recommend that something be do to ensure that there be one consistent database for microchipping that be accessible to vet the police and local authority be pleased to see that the government have issue guidance and that there will potentially be new regulation on that when we meet the minister tell that that will come into force before the end of this year hopefully that will make the use of the microchip database easier and reduce the cost of enforcement obviously the priority that bill or an issue have in the house depend largely on the view of right hon and hon member the government obviously believe that pet abduction be an important issue as indeed it be but we need to keep it in context with the burden on the enforcement authority of bring in new law and with that new penalty and essentially new pressure for prosecution that be why the guidance will be important the late figure that have show that in with million dog in the country there be only report of dog theft by contrast the late figure show that in england and wales in motor vehicle theft be report one every five minute we therefore need to keep the issue in context there seem to be an exponential increase in the incidence of motor vehicle theft and an inability of the police and the prosecute authority to investigate thoroughly and prosecute the perpetrator the number of motor vehicle theft be resolve by the prosecution and enforcement authority seem to be derisorily low therefore do not think we should have guidance that essentially say to the police that deal with the potential prosecution or investigation of theft of an unmicrochipped dog or cat should take precedence over try to find the perpetrator often gang who be steal motor vehicle to order off the street and in some case even from people garage or drive my hon friend be be generous in give way perhaps he might consider that the instance of motor vehicle be steal to order be symptom of organised crime just as we recognise that pet theft be now key contributor to organise crime accept that behind the incidence of pet theft there be organised crime but in the late figure that we have that organise crime have result in only some incident of dog theft compare with more than incident of motor vehicle theft many of which have be steal to order accept that some of the pet theft we be experience be because pet of increase value be be steal to order so be not say that we should not deal with that be say that we should ensure that the guidance issue reflect the public priority and do not divert too much police resource away to concentrate on pet theft rather than other crime such as motor vehicle theft that be the background to new clause which would require the secretary of state to publish guidance on the enforcement of the provision of the act hope that in respond my hon friend the minister will say that he will do that anyway so there will be no need to include this provision in the bill in our discussion one of the point make by my right hon friend the minister of state be that he would prefer the bill to go through the house totally unamended suspect however that that aspiration have be abandon because the promoter of the bill my hon friend the member for southend west have table her own amendment they seem perfectly reasonable but that would mean the bill would be amend in this place if the bill be to be amend one or two of her amendment could be complement by other amendment should they be necessary in that respect there have be development since our meeting when nobody declare need for the bill to be amend my hon friend will speak in due course will speak briefly to some of my other point the bill as draft state person commit the offence of dog abduction if they take dog so as to remove it from the lawful control of any person or detain dog so as to keep it from the lawful control of any person who be entitle to it it be only after have be arrest for that offence that person could take advantage of the defence under clause that before the allege abduction the pet be live in the same household as that person on point of order madam deputy speaker as the house will be aware very serious event have take place overnight in the middle east with israel apparently strike target in iran that could lead to far very serious escalation as former armed force minister and now member of the defence committee may take this opportunity to say that it be important as the house be fortuitously sit today that minister from either the foreign commonwealth and development office or the ministry of defence come to the house as soon as possible to make statement on exactly what we know about the attack and what the government believe the implication might be madam deputy speaker have you or the speaker office have any indication that the government intend to make such statement and if so at what time thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order as he say he be an ex armed force minister there have be no indication either to myself or to the speaker office so far as be aware that the government intend to make statement certainly at the conference meeting this morning there be no indication that the government intend to make statement but government front benchers will have hear his point far to that point of order madam deputy speaker do not for one moment wish to push my luck but under the circumstance believe that statement be very important as you know the government can interrupt business at any time to make statement such be the importance of these event and notify the office of the leader of the house that would make this point of order that believe before the house rise this afternoon minister should come to the house to tell we everything that the government know about what be go on will leave it at that thank the right hon gentleman for his further point of order note that he have inform the leader of the house of his strong view on the matter so think he be right that at this stage we leave that there take it from the ruling you have just make madam deputy speaker that unfortunately there be no application for an urgent question on the matter that my right hon friend raise if there have be such an application in the circumstance it be likely to have be grant perhaps the government when think about whether they will make statement should take into account that so far they have be very lucky that there be not an application for an urgent question in the require timescale they be probably prepare for such an eventuality so it would be reasonable for the government to come along and volunteer statement as my right hon friend have request the hon gentleman be rather push his luck could he return to his speech on the bill you be quite right madam deputy speaker to emphasise the importance of the bill we be discuss this be not the only occasion when compare with what be happen in the rest of the world the legislation we be discuss seem to many people to be relatively unimportant but pet abduction be very important subject for those who be directly affect by it before the point of order be seek to make the point that people should not be charge or arrest for dog abduction if it be clear at the time of the initial investigation that at the time of the taking or detention of the dog the person who take or detain the dog the person from whom lawful control be take and the dog all live together in the same household why should household in that situation be face with have to defend themselves against arrest and prosecution by use this defence surely it would be well and fair to require that someone only commit an offence if they abduct dog without lawful authority or reasonable excuse that be the background to my put forward new clause we increasingly put the cart before the horse in accuse people of crime and then force they to defend themselves against the allegation instead of require the prosecute authority to look into possible defence or excuse before make an arrest or institute prosecution amendment be design to test out whether an offence be commit if dog be not permanently remove from someone lawful control look forward to hear the minister comment in response to that amendment be design to ensure that an offence be commit only where dog be remove from the lawful control of its register keeper rather than where it be take from any other person know it will be say that if someone be dog walker or run some kennel and be not the registered keeper the offence of pet abduction should equally apply but in those circumstance the more serious offence of theft should be apply under the theft act again that would emphasise the distinction between somebody who be registered keeper and whose detail be set out on the microchip database and another person to whom the dog have be give for safe keeping for whatever reason amendment would test out the distinction between the requirement of permanence where someone be deprive an owner of their dog which in essence come under the theft act and the less stringent requirement under this bill amendment be similar amendment to ensure that only where dog be detain so as to keep it from its registered owner would there be an offence amendment be consequential on amendment and amendment be consequential on amendment that bring to amendment which deal with the key point that cause to get engage on report because we have great opportunity to link this new offence of pet abduction to the microchippe requirement as understand it there be very few prosecution for people keep dog or cat without comply with the microchippe requirement the microchippe requirement in respect of cat do not become law until early june but that law be already well in place in respect of dog as with all these thing there be danger that the government make regulation or legislate and then no proper enforcement take place why after plus year be probably the good part of million dog that should be microchippe still not what be be do about that why be nothing be do about it my amendment provide an opportunity to get the government to explain why microchipping be good idea but only for not of dog owner amendment would give the word keeper the same meaning in the bill as it have under the microchipping of cats and dogs england regulations again that be sensible and modest amendment amendment be probe amendment to tease out from the government what be happen in deal with cat abduction when they set up their taskforce it recommend that dog abduction should become the subject of the pet abduction legislation and that at some future stage reference to cat and other pet could be make when think of other pet think particularly of our old next door neighbour sadly she have die who be great lover of tortoise and have lot of they she be the subject of cruel theft of her tortoise and hop that in due course tortoise would come within the scope of this legislation as they can do under the provision of clause declare an interest as cat owner my cat be call hetty part of the reason that cat have be provide for specifically in the bill move support be the excellent campaign run by cats protection the briefing have receive from battersea show that there be pet cat theft in be not sure of the equivalent figure for tortoise but suspect it be lot small suspect that the incidence of theft of tortoise be much high if we look at the percentage of theft in the relative population my hon friend say there be only case of cat theft and my understanding be that there be million cat so if we work out the percentage of cat owner who find that they have be deprive of their cat suspect that it be much low than the percentage of tortoise owner who find that their tortoise have be abduct however think what my hon friend point show be that in the context of million cat theft be hardly really serious issue he be cat owner be not my family be dog lover but the two be not necessarily incompatible recognise the importance of microchippe cat obviously this legislation will not get on to the statute book until after the microchipping of cat have become mandatory and until there be criminal penalty if that be not comply with be proud to have visit the premise of the cats protection league in my constituency in ferndown which be very important centre for the rehoming of cat and that be one of the great task that that important charity undertake be not against cat but table this amendment to test the government thinking the original taskforce set up to look into these issue reach the conclusion that dog should take precedence but the government subsequently give way because of behind the scene lobby by interest group not as result of public consultation and support the extension of the legislation to cat the taskforce advice be to start off with dog and then extend the measure to cat all be do be in sense repeat what the taskforce say the essence of my amendment and so on be that they would enable cat to be include at later stage under the provision of clause thereby bring the bill into conformity with the recommendation of the pet abduction taskforce if the government do not want to do that understand why they may not then so be it but still think that be worth explore in debate that be why table the amendment include amendment which be consequential on the removal of clause as be amendment and the next amendment on the amendment paper be amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for southend west who promote the bill she say this be technical amendment to ensure that it be clear how the commencement of clause and operate in so far as those clause extend to england and wales rather than just in relation to england who could possibly object to that however when back benchers bring forward legislation and do not get it draft by government lawyer there be always something faulty with it and ministers delight in say at the dispatch box we agree with the intent but the wording be inadequate the question throw out for debate and discussion be this why do the government lawyer who draft the bill for my hon friend not get it right in the first place why do they leave it until so late in the day before insist that this amendment and amendment be include in the bill when she address her amendment hope that she can explain the background to that situation it show that instead of be all know and beyond criticism government drafter have some of the same frailty as member of the house when try to draft legislation even with all the expertise that the public bill office be able to bring to bear when assist we in that task amendment link back to my new clause which would make the commencement of the legislation contingent on the necessary guidance have be issue from discussion have with the ministerial team it seem that be the intent but the amendment would put that in the bill amendment be consequential and have already refer to amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for southend west that be quick run through of the amendment hope it will generate proper debate and discussion and enable people who take an interest in the matter to become more familiar with the issue around microchipping include the importance of ensure that cat and dog be microchippe the burden on the enforcement authority and the deterrence that microchippe provide against those who be minded to engage in the theft of pet hope those issue can be share more widely across the country there be lot more detail behind the bill but there be no need for to go into any more of that at the moment if the government can not accept new clause hope they will be able to provide undertaking that its measure will be implement voluntarily thank the hon gentleman for pass on his condolence to mr speaker as he say doug hoyle be great parliamentarian and very kind person who be always there with ready smile and good advice to all of we pass on our condolence to mr speaker from the whole house be delighted to have another opportunity to speak about this important bill and to speak to amendment and which be minor technical amendment in my name thank my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope for his interest in the matter hope he will forgive when say that his amendment seem to fall into two broad group laudable concern about microchipping and legal issue about the offence as draft will start with my hon friend amendment concern microchippe it be very clear that he have great passion for ensure that keeper microchip their pet be sure that we can all get behind that as general point that be very responsible way for dog and cat owner to behave microchipping be safe and reliable way of identify animal whether they be find as stray or whether in keep with the topic of this debate they be recover have be abduct the microchip should be lifeline to help they get home that be obviously good for the animal and good for the keeper agree wholeheartedly with my hon friend wish to ensure that we be more responsible and that we encourage microchippe although do not agree with his try to lever those principle into the bill the microchipping of dog have be compulsory in england since nine year ago it have also be compulsory in northern ireland since as he rightly point out microchipping have be success story around of dog in the uk be already microchippe there be also good evidence that microchippe work the government recent post implementation review of the microchipping of dogs england regulations conclude that the introduction of the regulation have increase microchipping and reunification rate with obvious benefit for animal welfare and pet owner be delighted that these benefit be soon to be extend to cat through the microchipping of cats and dogs england regulations agree with my hon friend when he say that all cat over week in england will need to be microchippe from june of this year in couple of month time before this be the key point the bill come into effect indeed already more than of cat in the uk be microchippe the level be similar in england and northern ireland the amendment that my hon friend seek to make today be totally unnecessary because we will be overtake by event in relation to the microchipping of cat the effectiveness of microchippe relie on keeper ensure that the information on the microchip be up to date that be what the police and the rescue centre need accurate information to enable they to reunite the keeper with their animal swiftly and efficiently as keep say could not agree with my hon friend more on the importance of that but do not think that it have anything to do with the bill be sure that my hon friend the minister will want to go into more detail about way in which he intend to encourage more microchipping understand my hon friend motivation for his amendment and to to far incentivise compliance with microchipping but as have already make clear there be high level of compliance already and further legislation be come down the track shortly there be also an effective enforcement mechanism where dog in england be find not to have microchip police in local authority have the power to issue notice that notice will require the keeper to get that dog microchippe within day that will apply unless the dog have be certify as exempt from the microchipping perhaps by reason relate to health and it be an offence to fail to comply with that notice person would be liable for fine of up to and the same regulatory regime will soon come into force and apply to cat as have say these amendment be not necessary because we will soon be overtake by event however far more importantly amendment and to would restrict the scope of this bill considerably amendment to would remove cat from the pet abduction bill entirely as well as remove certain dog from the scope of the offence regard that as very retrograde step indeed and one that would oppose entirely this legislation have be long time come it have be very carefully consider by the pet theft taskforce involve three government departments and to seek to undermine it in this way be entirely wrong will my hon friend give way no will not give way my hon friend have very long time to speak and would like to get through my remark cat be among the most beloved pet in the uk there be around million pet cat across the country and quarter of household have they must declare an immediate interest here as have two wonderful cat merlin and marmalade who be appal by these amendment which would take they entirely out of the protection of the bill we hear impassioned story on second read about the importance of cat to people and the heartache it would cause they if they be lose we hear about mrs landingham the cat of my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland and liesl von cat the cat of my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central jo gideon we hear from my hon friend the member for dover mrs elphicke about her beloved ragdoll cat and we have of course hear about cats protections today the cat theft report from pet theft awareness show that cat theft increase by in and more than quadruple between and this be grow problem cat deserve the same protection as dog will my hon friend give way have already say to my hon friend that will not give way at this point at all oh will give way be grateful to my hon friend for give way it be debate and wonder if instead of give percentage increase she could give put figure on the number of cat theft my hon friend be right to suggest that it be small it be matter of hundred not thousand the point that be make be that it be increase do not believe that cat deserve less protection as we hear on second reading from the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy who be not in her place bengal cat which have value of thousand of pound be among the cat be steal we can check hansard but from memory they might be worth as much as the number of cat may be small but the value of the cat both to the owner and in actual fact be significant my hon friend be make very good point it be about not just number but the emotional impact on family declare an interest as lose kitten at the age of four it still come into my mind when think about this bill and how important it be it have an emotional impact on my whole family number do not give the full flavour of the impact on the community across the united kingdom who be cat lover as well as dog lover be grateful to my hon friend for that point she be absolutely right whether someone cat be mongrel rescue cat or stray cat that they have rightly adopt and look after or have just check hansard bengal cat to the owner they be member of the family and they deserve the same protection merlin and marmalade deserve exactly the same protection as my precious cavapoochon lottie the house of commons library helpfully prepare brief for these debate and it refer to pet theft awareness which conduct freedom of information request across number of force some of the big force include greater manchester and other do not respond but take the figure from the metropolitan police and apply they at the same percentage rate we get figure of around cat theft year rather than the or so that be refer to be grateful to my hon friend for bring that more accurate information to the chamber and illustrate that we be talk about figure in the thousand for cat just as for dog if we be to remove cat abduction from the bill as per the amendment from my hon friend the member for christchurch we would be send clear message that cat do not matter as much as dog that would be wholly wrong it would certainly be meet with great deal of resistance from my constituent in southend west while be on the subject of cat would like to correct the record it have come to my attention that in committee on wednesday january respond to question from my hon friend the member for dover about indoor pedigree cat such as ragdoll inadvertently misspoke when speak about extend some of the dog provision to hold indoor cat say that clause should enable further provision to be make but that be not the case the enable power in the clause relate only to the abduction of animal commonly keep as pet other than dog and cat want to make that clear however as say clearly in committee and as assure hon member then and now clause already apply in relation to the taking of ragdoll cat the amendment would exclude certain category of dog although amendment acknowledge that dog can temporarily be exempt from microchippe requirement for medical reason it do not recognise that puppy do not have to be microchippe until they be eight week old be the amendment to be accept person take or detain puppy would be entirely exempt from the offence of dog abduction yet we know that high value puppy may be the subject of organised crime yesterday consult the police and crime commissioner for essex roger hirst about the bill and he remind as an essex mp you may recall this case madam deputy speaker that litter of blue merle french bulldog puppy value at in nearby basildon be steal in its entirety in clear case of organised crime to exclude puppy from the bill would be another extremely retrograde step the amendment would have the same effect in relation to dog that have be import into england by their keeper for holiday of less than day as the regulation do not require they to be microchippe it would also exclude certain work dog such as police and army dog that do not have to be microchippe until they be three month old they would be unprotected before then in addition there be risk in rely on definition lay down in secondary legislation that be crucial to the interpretation of the bill there be risk of unintended consequence in the application of the offence be the secondary legislation to be amend furthermore the microchipping of cats and dogs england regulations do not apply in northern ireland which have its own microchipping legislation as result if the amendment be make the abduction of most dog in northern ireland would be exclude from the scope of the dog abduction offence another backward step it be important to recognise that the abduction offence in the bill be deliberately frame around the broad concept of lawful control by not use term like keeper or owner the bill recognise that different people have lawful control of our dog at different time by change the wording as propose in amendment and person take dog so as to remove it from the lawful control of dog walker for example would not be commit an offence do not believe it be right for dog to be afford different level of protection in law accord to the individual the dog happen to be with at any give time we know that dog be commonly abduct from park or garden when they may well be under the lawful control of dog sitter dog walker or another member of the family why should dog that be steal or abduct in those circumstance be deal with differently do not believe that it should be and think most people in this country would agree in summary believe that abduct dog be an abhorrent crime think we can all get behind that idea regardless of whom the dog be take from and exactly the same be true for cat although be of course sympathetic to the underlie intention of amendment and to they move the bill far away from its intended spirit we simply can not create two tier system in which only microchipped animal be in scope of the legislation give that the legislation implicitly recognise that cat and dog be sentient being it be absolutely not right for only those that be microchippe to be protect so urge my hon friend the member for christchurch not to press those amendment will leave it to the minister to address my hon friend new clause and amendment let address swiftly my hon friend amendment and which fall into the broad basket of legal amendment the explanatory statement to the amendment suggest that he be seek to ensure that the person allege to have commit an offence be not require to prove their innocence if they have reasonable excuse or lawful authority for the act constitute the alleged offence be pleased to say again that he and agree in principle the burden in criminal case should always rest on the prosecution that be well and long establish principle of our english law but in my opinion the bill do just that its drafting be such that the prosecution do bear as usual the burden of proof what he be refer to be the fact that the bill place an evidential burden on the defendant in relation to the defence of reasonable excuse or lawful authority in that they need to produce sufficient evidence to raise that issue but the burden of prove the offence remain fairly and squarely on the prosecution my worry with the wording of the amendment be that they could introduce more uncertainty about the kind of burden that might be impose and could impose more of burden on the defendant for those reason urge he not to press amendment and turn now to amendment and which be also legal amendment they seek to restrict the offence to situation where dog be remove or detain permanently from person lawful control the pet theft taskforce suggest an offence of pet abduction in order to move away from the formal ingredient need to prove theft one of which be the intention to permanently deprive because that be more difficult to prove in relation to pet put that back into the bill take we back to place we want to move away from again urge my hon friend the member for christchurch to withdraw those amendment finally let turn to my two minor technical amendment and to clause you will recall madam deputy speaker that my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey table in committee an amendment relate to the commencement which be agree to so the original bill be change slightly that be the main driver for my two minor technical amendment which be practically stylistic in content they intend to clarify the bill draft in respect of the commencement of clause and which introduce the new offence of cat and dog abduction the amendment confirm that those clause so far as they extend to england and wales will come into force three month after the bill receive royal assent they also confirm that clause and so far as they extend to northern ireland will come into force on date appoint in an order by the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs of northern ireland for clarity the amendment be stylistic and do not in any way change the policy of the bill urge hon member to support those minor clarification of the bill rise to support the bill of my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth and the amendment in her name and to thank my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope for all the effort thought and consideration he have put into the work he have do as mention lose my kitten when be age four when microchippe be not thing it be one of my most prominent childhood memory it still stay with but if microchipping have be possible then we might have find that kitten and come back together as family it be such an issue for young girl lose my very first pet so thank my hon friend for all of his consideration microchipping be extremely important as he say and be very glad that the government will bring forward legislation in the near future wish to speak briefly about role that have over the past few year until recently that of chair of the all party parliamentary dog advisory welfare group praise and thank my hon friend the member for southend west for take this bill through parliament during my time as chair of that group we be able to bring lucy law into legislation and it make such huge difference to animal lover right across the united kingdom have chair number of all party parliamentary group and that be one of the most popular that ever chair during the pandemic up to member attend the meeting online and well over people would attend every single meeting in parliament itself we must recognise that the uk be most definitely country of dog lover also pay tribute to the local animal welfare sanctuary in bothwell just next to my constituency which visit very regularly it cover the whole of south lanarkshire include my constituency and thank it for its work when chair the dog advisory welfare appg pet theft be huge issue not only because as my hon friend the member for southend west say some of the dog steal be extremely highly pedigreed and valuable but because the fate of some of the dog be heinous often people be take the dog as bait for dog fight purpose the horrendous story that we hear in that appg underscore how vital it be that this legislation move forward it be an excellent step forward and think it send message to those who would try to abduct pet particularly dog and cat that it be not acceptable we wish to underscore that and this government have mandate to do so before close wish to give my condolence to mr speaker for his loss do not have the privilege of personally know his father but from my understanding he have be great servant to politic across both houses want to pass on my condolence today madam deputy speaker let begin by say that labour strongly support the measure to tackle pet theft and abduction and thank the hon member for southend west anna firth again for introduce the bill let also echo the comment about doug hoyle and the condolence to mr speaker much of the discussion in committee be about timing subject that have come up again this morning but will start by address amendment that have already be discuss particularly amendment which would effectively remove cat from the scope of the bill the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope seem to play an important role in this place on fridays along with some of my colleague have feel frustrated on occasion by the degree of challenge that he present but think it important for legislation to be properly challenge so thank he for the point that he have raise this morning especially in relation to the amendment relate to dog which open up range of wide issue will not go through the amendment in detail one by one because the hon member for southend west deal very effectively with many of those point and find myself in agreement with she on all of they but there be big issue involve in the way in which we register and track dog all this be complicated and know from talk to vet in my shadow ministerial role that they worry about be drag into ownership dispute as consequence think it be part of wide discussion and be certainly not oppose to our have that discussion but agree with the hon lady that there be danger of our be draw into delay and also into diminish the scope of the bill which think would be disappointing labour will therefore not support the amendment table by the hon member for christchurch amendment which relate to cat strike as something much more fundamental and we oppose it strongly as my colleague and have argue throughout the long saga of this bill and its predecessor cat theft be real issue note the discussion about number but suspect that there be degree of under reporting the offence do not currently exist so why would anyone report it those who advocate for cat be unsurprisingly appal by the prospect of the bill be savage in this way cats protection tell that with million own cat in the uk we know how much cat mean to family and how devastating their theft be both to the human who love they and the cat themselves it say in just few week of run some supporter action we have over cat lover get involve in campaign for cat to be include in any pet theft legislation include over letter to mps it be imperative that cat be include in the bill be sure the hon member for christchurch will say that campaign organisation make the case effectively do not necessarily lead to good law but think the point we can take from what it have say be that there be considerable public interest in the issue and an expectation that action will be take as for the microchippe issue that have be raise genuinely believe that they can be resolve after all we do not look at other theft offence and say that we will not tackle they because what be steal could not be microchippe there be particular irony in the discussion in committee about time and whether the bill could be implement within three month think conservative member know exactly what be go to say this could have be do fully two year ago we need not have be here today this be yet another private member bill that have appear as result of the government abandonment of the animal welfare kept animals bill it seem to that the real question about this pet abduction bill be who abduct the keep animal bill and for what purpose have ask that question repeatedly but have never be give an answer and be certain that will not be give one today it be just another of those defra mystery like the mystery of how the secretary of state come to override the advice of his permanent secretary but that be one for another day the government decision to ditch that major piece of animal welfare legislation have cause enormous disappointment to the animal welfare charity that have work so hard on it for year to pet owner and to member of the public all of whom care deeply about protect animal against cruelty most importantly of course it have allow the mistreatment of animal to continue we will never know how many animal might not have be abduct have this legislation be pass early be not the only person to have say that the same point be make powerfully early this month in report by the environment food and rural affairs committee the government withdrawal of the animal welfare kept animals bill stall progress on key animal welfare issue these delay have allow the continuation of poor animal welfare practice the department must ensure that every provision from the animal welfare kept animals bill be bring into force during the current parliament we welcome the introduction of private members bill that will take forward vital animal welfare measure but note that the government be rely heavily on member who be successful in the private members bill ballot be willing to take on its handout bill to deliver its manifesto promise rather than commit to bring forward the legislation itself while on this occasion it may prove successful it be nonetheless risky strategy that be why we be here today discuss this issue with piece of legislation that frankly be at risk because of the process we be go through there be no guarantee give political uncertainty and the febrile nature of politic at the moment that there will be time for the bill to reach the statute book the environment food and rural affairs committee be right to make those observation and it be deeply regrettable that contrary to what the government promise in their may action plan for animal they have fail to take leadership in crack down on the rise rate of pet abduction labour will not be support the amendment table by the hon member for christchurch but hope that the bill can proceed intact to third reading and beyond first may from the government benches send our condolence to mr speaker who be unable to be here today because he be attend his father funeral we send our sympathy to he it be pleasure to speak about this bill which be so important to many people thank my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope for his consider attention to the bill not only today but previously and in the meeting that and my right hon friend the minister of state hold with he in consideration of the point he have bring to the house also thank he for his support of some of the measure that we be bring forward in the bill thank my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth for her consider response and her contribution on report let start by address amendment and as be eloquently outline by my hon friend the member for southend west the bill already make it clear that prosecutor bear the burden of proof we want to create suitable offence that will crack down on case of dog and cat abduction and agree with my hon friend assessment that amendment and would undermine the scope for prosecution to be bring for the offence of dog and cat abduction too urge my hon friend the member for christchurch to withdraw amendment and on the basis of the point that have make and the contribution from my hon friend the member for southend west new clause and amendment and have already be discuss commend the dedication of my hon friend the member for christchurch to microchippe know he have branch of cats protection in his constituency as do my hon friend the member for north west norfolk james wild who rightly contribute to this debate state that cats protection have be instrumental in support the extension of the compulsory microchippe requirement to cat be pleased about both the extension and its support for this issue from the first moment that an offence of dog abduction be introduce in this place mp and stakeholder alike have ask for it to be extend to cat the department have receive significant number of letter from the public and parliamentary question from right hon and hon member in support of this proposal agree with my hon friend the member for southend west that the government can not support remove cat from the scope of the bill however understand that the desire of my hon friend the member for christchurch to remove cat from the scope of the bill be guide by the laudable intention of incentivising microchipping be pleased that we very much agree on the importance of microchipping which be the good way to reunite people with lose and abducted animal the government make microchippe compulsory for dog in england in and we be now extend the benefit of that legislation to cat from june all own cat in england over the age of week must be microchippe and register on compliant database microchipping be safe simple and effective procedure the average cost be plus an average registration over the lifetime of the animal microchipping undeniably help to bring displace pet home in the uk around of dog have be microchippe in more than of cat have already be voluntarily microchippe our post implementation review of the microchipping of dogs england regulations the predecessor to the regulation show that this legislation have have positive effect on reunification rate stray dog that have be microchippe and have up to date database record be more than twice as likely to be reunite with their keeper than stray dog without microchip police and local authority can and do issue notice require dog to be microchippe where it be not already that have be demonstrate to be an effective mechanism to support compliance since we introduce the english compulsory cat microchipping legislation we have be work closely with number of animal welfare stakeholder to develop co ordinate communication campaign to explain to cat owner the benefit of microchipping and the new legal requirement last summer we even enlist the support of our chief mouser larry the cat who himself be once an un microchippe stray before be take in and rehome by battersea dogs and cats home larry tweet on international cat day explain the importance of microchippe for reunite pet with their owner receive half million impression be also grateful to stakeholder who have help to spread the message at the start of our day countdown campaign to the introduction of these measure with just over day to go before the june deadline we be ramp up our communication strategy with stakeholder for that final push urge anyone who have not yet microchippe their cat to do so as quickly as possible our communication around the new cat microchippe rule as well as around this bill will provide clear message that microchipping will help bring abducted pet back home soon however compulsory cat microchipping be just one of number of plan microchippe reform last month we publish our response to the consultation on english pet microchipping reform we be commit to number of improvement to the microchippe regime around three theme first make it easy for approve user to access record secondly improve the accuracy of record and thirdly standardise database operator process those reform will implement one of the key recommendation of the pet theft taskforce that more robust process should be in place to stop steal pet be register to new keeper by ensure that the current keeper have up to day to object to transfer of keepership request make to database operator before any transfer can go through and by prevent database operator from create duplicate microchip record for pet we be also make all database operator record whether pet be report as miss that will assist enforcement body and flag concern to database operator should they receive transfer of keepership request we be look to legislate specifically to deal with that issue in due course my hon friend the member for southend west have eloquently outline how the amendment table by my hon friend the member for christchurch would overly restrict the bill and the government can not support they my hon friend the member for christchurch rightly make some point on guidance in his new clause and amendment and ask for statutory guidance to be issue by the secretary of state agree that guidance will be essential for frontline worker enforce new pet abduction offence ensure that those be use appropriately the government be commit to work with key stakeholder to ensure that appropriate guidance relate to this bill will be available before the bill offence come into force the cross government pet theft taskforce already establish relationship with police officer operational partner and animal welfare organisation work in the area so we have network already in place and can confirm that conversation be already under way will ensure that the point that my hon friend have rightly raise be part of the conversation that be already under way enforcer will have the support and information they need to effectively implement the legislation once it come into force without the need to legally require enforcement guidance know that my hon friend the member for christchurch be concerned about people benefit from the legislation when they have shirk their responsibility to have their pet microchippe assure the house that we be do work with police colleague to make they aware that in the event that they recover an abducted cat or dog that be not microchippe they have the power to issue notice under the english microchipping regulation require those pet to be microchippe within day for completeness fail to comply with such notice be an offence and subject to fine of in addition the microchipping of cats and dogs england regulations provide for the police to be able to take the animal in question to be microchippe without the keeper consent and allow the cost associate with that to be recover the enforcement regime for the english microchipping legislation be design to ensure that an animal will end up be microchippe if it be find not to be we understand that most people comply with such notice where issue so only small number of such case be take through the court in addition to the exist enforcement mechanism we be consider enable penalty notice for the offence of not microchippe cat or dog through the animal penalty notices england regulations in summary can not therefore commit that we will be sorry can commit want to reiterate that that we will be work closely with enforcement partner to ensure that my hon friend concern be address we be work at speed to prepare for this engagement on the amendment table by my hon friend the member for southend west thank she for bring forward these minor technical adjustment to the bill the government support they and agree that their clarity help to progress the bill specifically in relation to clause and urge all hon member to support they with the leave of the house will respond to the debate we have make great progress and be grateful to my hon friend the minister for facilitate that my amendment particularly amendment to be design to address the problem of potential waste of police and local authority enforcement resource in try to trace pet that have not be microchippe my hon friend in say what he do about the guidance and advice that will be give to enforcement authority get to the core of my concern it have never be my intention to be anti cat my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth suggest that do not think that cat matter will not put myself into category where cat do not matter because have enough email come in already on other issue laughter cat do matter and so do dog and for the sake of completeness so do tortoise have never be against include cat in the bill but have be nervous about do so when many cat be still not microchippe from june that will be compulsory and as the minister say there will be strong enforcement measure give the number of local authority issue notice do not think they be apply their mind to it but perhaps when they link that in with the prospect of complaint if cat have be abduct they will realise that there be strong link between the two issue hope that the consequence of all this debate will be that we have much well more complete database and that more cat and even more dog will be microchippe have million plus dog not microchippe at the moment be unacceptable one can not always say on friday that we have make progress but think that we have on this issue in the light of that beg to ask leave to withdraw new clause clause by leave withdraw clause commencement amendments make page line leave out come into force in relation to england and insert so far as they extend to england and wales come into force this be technical amendment to ensure that it be clear how the commencement of clause and operate in so far as those clause extend to england and wales rather than just in relation to england amendment page line leave out in relation and insert so far as they firth this be technical amendment to ensure that the commencement of clause and be deal with in the same way throughout clause third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time may put on the record on behalf of everybody in southend west our condolence to mr speaker and his family on the loss of his esteemed father doug hoyle be delighted to present this bill for its third reading be grateful to all member who have engage so passionately and share their story at all stage and will keep my remark as brief as can so that other member can get in will start as do on second reading by take moment to reflect on my predecessor sir david amess who be true titan when it come to champion our pet particularly dog as mention on second reading he chair and speak in the last debate that we have in this place on pet reform and know that he would be so proud that southend west be play pivotal role in bring forward this legislation too be proud to be build on his legacy again today when introduce the bill start by say that britain be nation of animal lover and that pet be part of our family believe that our discussion both today and at all previous stage have illustrate that perfectly we be show that cat and dog be not just item and that abduct they cause real distress to family and individual because action speak far louder than word this bill will send signal that we take animal welfare seriously in the uk one wonderful thing about the house be that we be often united when it come to issue of animal welfare we be unite in send signal to the world that we believe in and be proud of our record on animal welfare of course have lot of people to thank thank the people who have make significant contribution in this area over many year include my right hon friend the members for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith and for witham priti patel my hon friend the members for stroud siobhan baillie for dartford gareth johnson and for ipswich tom hunt the former lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland with whom be at bar school my hon friend the member for dover mrs elphicke dr daniel allen and debbie matthews the daughter of the late sir bruce forsyth thank the many organisation that have give input and support include the conservative animal welfare foundation which be so ably lead by chris and lorraine platt the stolen and missing pets alliance pet theft awareness cats protection which we have hear about again today the dogs trust battersea dogs and cats home refuge and of course southend own tilly angels which prompt to take this bill on board also thank the brilliant essex police fire and crime commissioner roger hirst for his help and support and more importantly for all that he do to tackle pet abduction in essex tackle pet abduction in particular dog theft be key objective in his police and crime plan as result of his focus and the extra resource he deploy we have see reduction in the dog theft figure over the past year he do fantastic work if anyone in essex want to help he to keep fight pet abduction they will have the opportunity to do so on may want to emphasise the timely nature of the bill since second reading new figure have be release by direct line show uptick in the number of dog abduct in the past year with only one in six find and return that be the low recovery level since those figure should concern we all because of the number of pet who be traumatise and separate from their owner most of they permanently family be go without beloved member of the family as have say throughout that be exactly what our pet be we have also see distress article in my local paper about attempt pet abduction which also seem to be on the rise only last month my local paper the brilliant southend echo carry an article about two thug in benfleet who jump out of their van and hit pensioner over the head with lump of wood in an attempt to force he to hand over his beloved cocker spaniel thankfully the pensioner incur only minor injury and the dog be unharmed but he be obviously deeply shake this week there have be report of another incident in benfleet man be attack by two man in woodside park who be attempt to steal his dog those report underline how important it be that we get the bill on the statute book and that the police start take action to enforce it these really be shocking incident and implore all hon and right hon member to back the bill pet need to be recognise in law for the sentient being they be their place in society need to be properly recognise by the law of the land the bill be the opportunity to do that hope all member support it congratulate my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth on her work on the bill which be much need and be very pleased to speak in favour it we be nation of dog and cat owner and many member will be able to say that those animal be like family and to speak about the fact that they play such an important role in our life and the life of our child do not know where marmalade and merlin come from the newly famous southend west resident but magic and ninja come from cats protection which have have so many mention today know through magic and ninja what an impact cat can have on family in particular child in milton keynes we have an abundance of green space with mile and mile of lake shoreline and canal towpath ideal for walk dog if you need to walk dog come to milton keynes but that bring with it the add risk of pet theft as an animal lover and the representative of beautiful constituency in which to walk the dog have to say that the very idea of steal pet often for profit and breeding be sick the bill fill gap that have exist in law for far too long until now pet theft be categorise as type of property theft that be in no way reflective of the nature of the crime and its impact on victim we speak briefly about the link with organised crime it be increasingly worry that like other type of theft such as the theft of farm machinery and prestige vehicle pet theft seem to be do to order by gang of organise criminal the supply chain of organised crime be obviously horrendous to think that pet theft be finance it be abhorrent in milton keynes and the wide thames valley our rural crime taskforce have recently be nearly double in size which will be significant comfort to the many legitimate breeder base in our village applaud our police and crime commissioner matthew barber for make that decision it be critical that the punishment for this crime be enough to deter individual and group from engage in this despicable criminal activity the bill ensure exactly that applaud my hon friend the member for southend west and the government for the work that they have do to develop it so far under the legislation offender will face the possibility of up to five year in prison fine or both the spectre of such punishment should have the desire effect organised crime group profit particularly from the trade in pedigree cat but such group will think twice about offend should the bill become law the bill address difference in the behaviour of dog and cat really well dog spend much more time indoor than cat try keep cat indoor they tend to roam outside freely at their own will visit dinner sid spring to mind the bill understand that distinction and ensure that for cat the offence apply only when cat be take not when it be detain that will mean police can focus on case of clear criminality without undue interference he be no long in his place but my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope raise concern about police time this aspect of the legislation go some way to ease those concern this be sensible and practical law making the new offence mean that we can start to record the crime with well accuracy as we have hear some force record these crime specifically and other do not we will be able to spot pattern that could be link to certain factor such as organised crime this conservative government can be proud of their achievement on animal welfare the bill will widen the scope of the government action plan on animal welfare it be another step forward in put the uk at the forefront of animal welfare globally toughen the country law against animal cruelty be key priority that be why we have already pass legislation such as the animal welfare sentencing act which raise the maximum sentence for animal cruelty from six month to five year and the landmark animal welfare sentience act which become law two year ago and formally recognise animal as sentient being in domestic law the bill almost act as strong arm extension of that act pet be sentient being whom we have to love and cherish as our own we need law that recognise that fact and crucially protect they in that regard this government have deliver and then some our progress on animal welfare do not stop there we have also pass legislation require the microchipping of cat as we hear from the minister cat owner must microchip their cat by june this year that will make it easy to pick up cat that have be abduct and to identify stray pet so that they can be reunite with their owner it be always pleasure to speak in support of bills that have clear cross party support and cut through party political battle line issue such as these remind we of the common ground we have in this place and that we can put party politic aside to make progress on area of policy such as animal welfare which matter to million of people across the country congratulate my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth on her work on this bill she have work tirelessly on this issue and have be pleased to support she at every stage include by serve on the public bill committee we be nation of animal lover as the owner of three dog will not name they again as they be already extensively record in hansard can say that this bill provide we all with great confidence that those who would seek to steal our beloved pet will pay the price our pet be not just possession as the law have previously treat they in the bill we be acknowledge the important relationship we all have with our pet who be cherish member of our family the theft of pet be an incredibly distressing experience for both the pet and its owner so it be no surprise that the vast majority of the public support make pet theft specific offence my constituency postbag regularly contain correspondence from constituent who have concern about animal welfare be it puppy smuggling dog on dog attack or the theft of beloved family pet an issue that the bill address have yet to meet anyone who do not acknowledge that the theft of family pet would cause far more pain and anguish than that of wallet purse or phone pet simply have far more than simply monetary value to we and it be right that the law seek to acknowledge that and mark they out as different from inanimate object in prepare for today debate check with durham police on the rate of pet theft in their area and be pleased to learn that it have fall significantly from record theft in to only nine in although welcome that reduction nine be still many and this bill will send out real signal to far address the issue although durham have have welcome reduction in such theft part of our country sadly still see worrying level of pet theft pet will be steal purely for the selfish retention of the animal deprive the family it belong to of the pet companionship and inflict sense of loss alternatively pet may be steal for onward sale breed or fighting whatever the reason for theft it be unlikely that the place the animal end up in will be well than the love home it have be take from the bill must be see in the context of the wide range of animal protection legislation we have enact which recognise animal sentience increase sentence for animal cruelty give new protection to service animal revamp local authority licensing implement lucy law ban third party puppy and kitten sale and mandate microchippe for cat and dog of course we must also not forget the bill which be proud to support buy forward by my hon friend the member for north devon selaine saxby to deal with puppy kitten and ferret smuggling in conclusion our pet be our constituent dearest companion and most loyal friend and we need specific offence with specific penalty for their theft wholeheartedly support this bill and look forward to it complete its remain stage today while we earnestly await statement from the government on the israeli strike against iran last night want to take the opportunity to pay full tribute to my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth for her wonderful work on this bill it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for darlington peter gibson who mention that he have read the name of his three pet into hansard if he be like most of we he will now have send each pet copy of hansard so that they know they be mention and we hope that go down well with they will come on to praise my hon friend the member for southend west at the end but perhaps may briefly tell the house about some other people who know will be very pleased to see this legislation pass in the house today let begin with great friend my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith who unfortunately be detain on other important business today the issue before we have always be close to his heart he have have some horror story from his constituency about pet theft so know that he former leader of our party will be delighted at my hon friend success with this bill next be our very proactive and hard work police fire and crime commissioner in essex mr roger hirst who take this issue very seriously ably support by our dynamic chief constable mr harrington perhaps his dynamism be due in part to the fact that he use to be paratrooper between they they have ensure that essex police be now fully integrate into the national pet taskforce tackle crime through the review of all investigation the introduction of proactive ability to respond to intelligence and join up work with partner include crimestopper the rspca and dogwatch as practical example my hon friend the member for southend west tell that this proactive approach be put into action early this year when police release footage of the dachshund twiglet struggle to get away from thief with help from the public the police be able to return twiglet safely home to her family will allow my hon friend to send twiglet the hansard declare an interest in my boyhood have pet dachshund call tiger my parent have sense of humour madam deputy speaker love that little dog dearly when tell he that be take he out for walk he go completely banana have fond memory of tiger and if he be still with we he too would be delighted unfortunately he have pass away so there be no one to send the hansard to also thank the conservative animal welfare foundation of which my hon friend and be avid supporter brilliantly lead by lorraine and chris platt and their team who be absolutely passionate about animal welfare the clue be in the name they too will be delighted that this legislation be go through finally know that our great friend sir david amess would have be delighted to see this day david as the whole house well know be passionate about animal welfare one of his great skill as you will know madam deputy speaker be work cross party it be form coalition for the common good look up at his plaque and across to that of jo cox who also die in the service of this house she once say that we have more in common this be nation of animal lover and what my hon friend have do brilliantly today be to get cross party support she have motivate that sense of have more in common across the house to do something that will make animal safe they can not speak for themselves we must do it in their lieu she have do brilliantly and she have another win recently on ban zombie knife will if may be presumptuous and say that if david be still with we and somehow my hon friend be still the mp he would be very proud of what she have do today she be turn out to be an incredibly worthy successor to my great friend and she have come up with an incredibly worthy piece of legislation and member across the house wish her bill godspeed echo what my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois have say about sir david like other member strongly welcome this legislation congratulate my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth on her work be pleased that her bill have make it to this stage with wide range support in north west norfolk and obviously across the country the bill introduce new criminal offence in relation to the taking or detaining of dog or cat from the lawful control of any person as mention in an intervention declare an interest as the owner of cat hetty and pay tribute again to the cat protection league for its successful campaign which support to ensure that cat be in the bill in clause along with dog someone find guilty of abduct dog or cat under these new offence will be liable to maximum of five year imprisonment fine or both which be significant step forward and align with animal cruelty offence cover by the animal welfare act be pleased that the bill include an enable power to allow these provision to be extend to other animal commonly keep as pet bid have be make for tortoise already in the debate pet be steal for many reason because of the breakdown of relationship or for breeding resale extortion or even dog fighting those theft have traumatic effect on the owner and the pet so it be right that pet theft be tackle through the creation of specific offence the origin of the bill be in the work of the pet theft taskforce which recommend the creation of the specific offence of pet abduction which be be implement through this legislation because the theft act itself be not prove effective there have be discussion during the debate about the scale of the problem the taskforce conclude that reliable datum on pet theft be limited the most accurate figure that could find for my area norfolk be through an foi response from norfolk police which show that between and cat and dog be record as steal overall battersea report around dog theft and nearly cat theft in that be likely to be significantly underreporte for obvious reason as my hon friend the member for southend west mention it be about the individual case there do not need to be ten of thousand of case for this to be important legislation however welcome the bill intention to improve the recording and monitoring of these offence when we legislate and pass important power such as these it be important that they come into effect rapidly so welcome the amendment that my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey secure in committee which set date for the legislation to come into effect three month after royal assent in the manifesto that be proud to stand on committed to improve animal welfare standard and this bill deliver on that commitment as nation of animal lover with proud history of championing and take action on animal welfare the government have already pass host of measure include cctv become mandatory in slaughterhouse compulsory microchipping and tough sentence for animal cruelty to conclude around third of household own dog and quarter of household have cat we need to protect these family member and this legislation do just that therefore commend my hon friend for her hard work in bring the bill forward and look forward to support it through its final stage call the shadow minister let reiterate how strongly we in labour support these measure again thank the hon member for southend west anna firth for bring the bill forward also echo her comment and those of other about sir david amess think he absolutely would have be thrill to see this legislation go forward today would also echo the hon lady comment about the many animal welfare charity that work so hard on this and provide such excellent briefing again think they too will be very pleased to see the legislation go forward as have be say we be nation of animal lover pet be very much cherished part of our family we know that companion animal be sentient being who can experience pain fear and distress just as we can and we can all imagine some member have speak passionately about it today the heartbreak that be experience by any pet owner when their beloved animal be abduct yet we talk about the number early the kennel club estimate that there be case of dog theft in amount to approximately dog steal every month as we have hear cat be also increasingly victim of this crime with report by pet theft awareness find that in police record increase and quadrupling since as we have hear throughout this process the law as it currently stand be ill equipped to deal with the problem under the theft act pet be wrongly treat as inanimate object their value be diminish to that of physical property like tv or toaster and that can not be allow to continue that be why the pet theft taskforce recommend in that new offence of pet abduction be create new kind of offence that would put the emphasis on the welfare of the animal abduct and pay due regard to their status as sentient being that be what the bill do with those two new criminal offence of dog abduction and cat abduction attract up to five year imprisonment fine or both to deter those who be look to exploit animal for financial gain by steal they from their owner and sell they or use they for breed through the creation of those specific offence pet owner will now have clear legal framework by which they can ensure that their case be actively investigate create those specific offence will also require police to collate well datum allow any pattern emerge to be properly analyse collate more accurate datum will help to formulate the good prevention strategy be delighted that we have manage to ensure that cat be cover as well as dog with compulsory microchipping it should soon be much easy for anyone attempt to ascertain whether cat be own or lose to establish those detail be also pleased that there be an enable power so that the appropriate national authority may create pet abduction offence in respect of more specie of animal where there be significant evidence of incident involve the unlawful taking or detaining of animal of that specie or significant

amendment bill consideration of bill not amend in the public bill committee clause the funding limit fund to be disregard beg to move amendment page line leave out from to end of line and insert may not be make unless draft of the instrument have be lay before and approve by resolution of each house of parliament this amendment change the procedure that apply to an si contain regulation under new subsection of section of the building societies act insert by the bill so that it be subject to the affirmative procedure with this it will be convenient to discuss amendment page line leave out from to to end of line and insert approval by both houses of parliament thank you very much madam deputy speaker the variety of bills be in the strange nature of this place we be go from the warm and fluffy bill that we have just discuss which be delighted have receive its third reading to what be rather dry bill but an important one none the less amendment which stand in my name change the procedure that apply to statutory instrument relate to propose new subsection to section of the building societies act they will be subject to the affirmative procedure rather than to the negative procedure as the bill currently state table the amendment after talk to colleague on both side of the house on reflection it provide for close scrutiny of the potential change that could be make via secondary legislation under the bill the amendment do not change the immensely positive effect that believe the bill will have on the building society sector by bring it in line with current practice nor do it change the bill aim which will in my view enormously improve opportunity for people to get on the housing ladder the result of the bill will be well landscape for first time buyer and the amendment just improve scrutiny rise very much to support amendment in the name of the hon member for sunderland central julie elliott be grateful to she for effectively take forward my amendment which we be tell be defective because although it would achieve exactly the same purpose it do not use the normal wording that government drafter like after some discussion it be agree by the hon lady and the minister that it be sensible to use the affirmative procedure in relation to these delegate power and that affirmative procedure be now reflect in amendment it could have be reflect in amendment but what be important be the substance of the matter these be potentially very significant change that could be make and if they be to be make it be important that they be open to proper scrutiny as we know the negative procedure do not really enable proper scrutiny as an example madam deputy speaker you will recall that legislation be bring forward at the end of last year extend the breed cover by the dangerous dogs act to include dog of the xl bully type table an early day motion to try to amend that that early day motion be on the order paper but it be never accept or debate mean that that change which affect hundred of thousand of dog and their owner be make without any proper scrutiny in parliament that be why it be important to have the affirmative procedure where possible and be very grateful to the hon lady for have bring forward this amendment which support amendment agree to third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time it be pleasure to bring this bill back for further debate as it now exist in an amend form it be key moment for bill that be important to the building society sector and must thank all colleague from both side of the house who have take part as the bill have go through its various stage they have be so supportive of the bill be go to keep my remark short so that if other member wish to speak they can do so and to try to make sure that the bill progress be as smooth as possible the building societies act amendment bill will help level the play field between build society and bank and will support building society to be able to lend more money in safe and secure way to trade as building society the building societies act require the company to obtain minimum of of funding from its member what be know as the wholesale funding limit this bill do not change that and it do not dilute the unique ownership model of building society the fundamental nature of building society be run in the interest of its member be not change by the bill in fact that be what make the sector so special what the bill do be disregard the following from the wholesale funding limit bank of england liquidity insurance facility debt instrument raise to meet the minimum regulatory requirement for own fund and eligible liability requirement and sum receive under sale and repurchase agreement with view to comply with prudential regulation authority rule this mean that in time of national economic crisis building society will have more option within their gift for remain comfortably solvent and will therefore continue to serve in their member interest the bill be design to allow future government to respond to the financial landscape of the day that be why it do not specifically define fund but instead defer the specification of fund to later date through secondary legislation pass in this house all the response from the sector to the government consultation on this issue in advance of the edinburgh reform be positive those reform make the sector more robust the bill also seek to modernise the sector it amend the act to explicitly allow the option of real time virtual member participation bring the sector in line with the requirement that the companies act place on business it also enable the treasury to introduce more flexibility for society in relation to common sale and the execution of document in line with company law the bill be important because it would achieve great deal in very succinct manner allow the sector to operate on more level playing field with bank this be positive for number of reason but especially in view of the sector support for first time buyer more than half build society lending go to first time buyer and since building society just in my region the north east and cumbria have lend they some billion this bill follow number of previous private member bill include that of my hon friend the member for preston sir mark hendrick which receive royal assent last year that continue to modernise the sector will not restate all the fact that present on second reading powerful as they be but it be important to acknowledge that while the housing sector have recover significantly since the record low mortgage approval during the covid pandemic and have recover from the acute economic shock cause by the last conservative administration mortgage approval be currently still below the level that that we see before the pandemic that be why think that bill such as this which give more choice to the building society sector to operate in the interest of its member be good thing as have say the sector have strong record in support first time buyer and give that every million of lending could support an additional mortgage be proud to be introduce bill with the potential not just to support the housing sector and the wide economy but to allow building society to help more people on their journey to home ownership have speak to many constituent in sunderland who be struggle to get on to the housing ladder young couple and family who just want the chance to have place that be theirs and in which they can feel comfortable away from volatile and often unfair rental market the government failure to reform the sector be debate to be have elsewhere on another day but expect this bill to do more to support sector that often go above and beyond to support its member and to help people get on to the housing ladder and secure future for themselves its passing would be landmark moment for the sector and look forward to see the positive effect that it would bring congratulate the hon member for sunderland central julie elliott on present the bill and bring it this far have present private member bill myself know all about

furthermore the amendment in the name of the hon member for sunderland central mean that the statutory instrument will be subject to the affirmative procedure allow for great parliamentary scrutiny that come on the back of very constructive work from across the house the amendment do not change the policy outcome of the bill in any way but simply amend the parliamentary procedure that will be follow when subsequent regulation be make secondly the bill allow for the option of real time virtual participation at build society meeting this will improve meet accessibility and promote wide membership engagement should the member of any building society choose to permit virtual participation under their rule finally the bill will provide his majesty treasury with the power to far align

importance of the building society sector which support people and community across the country extend my thank to the hon lady for introduce the bill and for progress it to third reading she can be assure that the government share the vision set out in the bill for support the future growth and prosperity of the building society sector with the leave of the house would like to thank all member

to have debate on bill on which everybody agree everybody can see the very tangible benefit it will have for all our constituent it have take lot of work from lot of people to get to this point thank not only colleague who have take part at every stage but treasury official who have be extremely helpful the clerks whose advice support and guidance be as always in this place invaluable the whips the building societies association and our sister party the co operative party they have all contribute and help with advice and support as have take the bill through the house commend it to the house

to move amendment not move sir thank you consideration be complete interruption understand that king consent will need to be signify for third reading on point of order mr deputy speaker can we move on to the next business please technically no not at this moment far to that point of order mr deputy speaker at what point can we make speech on the bill once the third reading debate have commence third read king consent signify beg to move that the bill be now read the third time in answer to the question from my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope who have an amendment down on the amendment paper may just say that that be the subject of great deal of discussion and debate between the ministry the sponsor and myself thank my hon friend the member for christchurch for have in effect withdraw his amendment follow various discussion will my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman explain why it be important and timely that we ensure the bill receive its third reading today and progress to the other place let explain the situation with the length of lease which be the point of contention it be the subject of discussion and debate with the ministry the minister original proposal be for year lease extension which would not have allow the zoological society of london to get the investment require to lengthen the lease and renovate the site of london zoo it have literally have its big animal move up to whipsnade zoo so that they can roam freely as we would all like that mean the cage in which they be keep be now redundant and need to be completely remove with modern facility provide as result we have agree the compromise at year for clarity will my hon friend outline when the zsl current lease commence thank my hon friend for his intervention but do not have that detail to hand what be important be that the lease be ongoing and therefore run out in respect of the crown estate provision london zoo be unfortunately leave out when we do the extension to kew garden so this bill seek to be in keep with the provision for kew garden as for other part of the crown estate that be the crucial element it have be privilege to take this bill my third private member bill through parliament since visit the zoo in january have work with range of people to get to this stage without whom it would not have be possible the zoo be situate in regent park and be home to more than animal it be true london landmark if colleague have not visit recommend it as an abundantly enjoyable interesting and captivate day out with the add bonus of be only short tube journey from this place every year tourist from london and the wide uk and indeed from around the globe visit the zoo which contribute to the uk wide economy as visitor be more likely to spend money in the surround area particularly as the zoo be only stone throw from many of london cultural hotspot my hon friend be make an excellent speech on an important topic that visitor economy be essential to all part of our country but it be really important to london do he know how many international visitor travel to visit the zoo each year thank my hon friend for his intervention and will come to that point in few moment the key point be that the zoo contribute million to the local economy as well as make the income it need to maintain its research and keep threaten specie safe community outreach project be instrumental in the philosophy of the zoo on my visit be very impressed by the new garden area where volunteer with complex need can spend the day garden and visit the animal for much need respite and wellbee the zoo have also recently implement community access scheme to enable those on income support and other benefit to visit for as little as in the recent february half term visit be facilitate through that scheme it be essential that everyone regardless of where they live have access to nature and outdoor space be therefore pleased that zsl be commit to provide access to those who need the extra help so that no one be leave out the reputation of the wide zoo sector have come in for bit of examination in recent decade and it have be criticise perhaps correctly for enclosure that be too small and concern be raise that we be start to look at animal as object for entertainment rather than consider the preservation of rare specie would be grateful if my hon friend expand little on the step that this zoo have take to move away from the outdated approach of zoological society in the past and to lead the fight to retain really rare specie for reintroduction in the wild clearly the decision have be make to move the large animal to whipsnade zoo which zsl also run so that they have the space they need to roam in and feel more like they be in the wild while still be protect that mean those facility at london zoo be now redundant and this be precisely the reason for the bill need to be replace with modern facility for other protect specie and so that visitor can see they in suitable accommodation those specie obviously do not need to roam but they will be give modern facility encourage other zoo across the country and indeed across the world to consider the same thing my hon friend be be very generous with his time this bring to the zoo build structure the zoo have be in that location for well over year perhaps it be year and some of the structure that see when visit as child be of considerable architectural merit and perhaps historic merit what step be the zoo take to ensure that its structure be appropriate for modern usage and that its list building if there be any be protect and that the architectural merit of the historical victorian enclosure be recognise thank my hon friend for that intervention clearly many of these structure be protect which be one reason why it be so expensive to bring they up to modern standard while retain the original architecture if it be simple case of demolish and put in new facility there would be less cost that be why very large investment be require which the zoo can not raise from its own resource it have to borrow the money and as result it need lease that be long enough for investor to know that the revenue will come in from visitor and other attraction and that they will recover their fund this be why the bill be so vital for safeguard london zoo for the future my hon friend will be well aware that zsl have highlight that the exist lease condition be limit its ability to fundraise to create partnership to expand its support programme and of course to invest in that vital renovation of the physical infrastructure can he confirm that this law would not automatically extend the lease to year in and of itself but would allow the department for culture media and sport to offer this lease so it be not automatic but step in the right direction to enable that support for the zoo thank my hon friend for that intervention that be what we hope to hear from the minister later on clearly we be in position whereby we be make the offer but we will have to see about that negotiation to ensure that there be suitable protection so that be such terrible event to occur such that zsl should no long have the lease it would be remove however it have operate very successfully on the site for many year so do not think that be likely move on the educational offering provide critical supplement to classroom work for many child in fact many of we will have have the opportunity to visit the school as child the workshop which be specifically tailor to cater for all age group and learn need educate child on such hugely important topic as wildlife conservation climate change and the impact of pollution the zoo research have perhaps benefit animal the most shape the future of many previously endanger specie many animal at risk of extinction have participate in the zoo breed programme to ensure that they be save for future generation in alone million be spend on conservation science and field conservation programme with million spend on conservation animal care breed programme and conservation translocation be pleased that in the come month the zoo will be return the previously endanger guam kingfisher back into the wild and only recently over the easter break three endanger asiatic lion cub be bear at the zoo to dot parent seven year old mum arya and year old dad bhanu the animal do not recognise working hour annual leave or bank holiday they need supervision and care hour day seven day week to ensure that they be feed and care for whenever need that emphasise the need for the dedicated and thorough programme that the zoo operate on it be profoundly clear that the zoo be an integral part of society and thus we must protect its heritage and position be pleased that we have make it to third reading and be confident that hopefully on receive royal assent the future of the zoo will be much more stable and bright increasingly attractive opportunity for investment purpose look at the wording of the bill there be question mark over its drafting and would be grateful if my hon friend could explain it to we can see in clause that the bill be in relation to certain land in regent park with the potential to substitute year for year it be very specific the potential power be in relation to certain land and lease relate to regent park in london yet clause state this act extend to england and wales scotland and northern ireland can my hon friend clarify that for what be the need for the extension to the jurisdiction of wales scotland and northern ireland when the lease be particular to regent park in london clearly we be look at lease and leasehold law that be the reason for clarify that particular issue in that particular way would like to thank matthew gould the chief executive officer for zsl matthew and have cross path on several occasion prior to his appointment to his previous position as the government first director general for digital and medium at dcms and as britain ambassador to israel therefore it feel fitting to have come full circle and to have work with he on this bill over the past year his devotion to the welfare and happiness of the zoo animal be steadfast with commitment to the research and development of specie across the globe and to tackle the world challenge include the current biodiversity crisis my next thank go to vicky godwin senior public affair officer for the zoo vicky have be on hand throughout the progress of the bill facilitate the discussion between the department my office and zsl she have also come in to provide support every step of the way watch the debate at the bill various stage be very grateful to my colleague who helpfully sit on the bill committee and allow the bill to pass unanimously with no amendment it be super to hear the support for london zoo from so many highly respected member from both in and outside london some such as previous employee my hon friend the member for north herefordshire sir bill wiggin who be keeper at london zoo in his distant past have more vested interest my hon friend personal experience that he share in committee be interesting to put it mildly also thank the clerks in the public bill office who bear with we through the process inform my office on procedure and development particularly thank they for their patience during the mad scramble to ensure that we have enough member serve on the committee ahead of the deadline they often get overlook in this place but their work be crucial to ensure the proceeding of the chamber run smoothly and we be all very grateful for all that they do the minister and official in her department have support the bill throughout for which be exceptionally grateful their advice and assistance with draft the bill have be invaluable indeed they redrafte our original draft it be great that the government be support this worthy change in the lease which benefit the zoo the local area and obviously all the potential visitor have no doubt that should the minister or indeed any other colleague wish to visit the zoo they will be greet with open arm and meet with many friendly face both human and animal also thank my parliamentary assistant hattie shoosmith as always when she draft these speech she miss herself out of the thank but put on record my thank to she will just remind colleague about some of the endanger specie and particular zoo animal that have be protect as direct result of this bill come to fruition the first be one of my favourite animal guy the gorilla on guy fawkes day in very small gorilla arrive at london zoo clutch tin hot water bottle at first he would only respond to french as he have spend the previous six month in the zoo in paris guy become one of the zoo well love character remember see he as young boy when sparrow enter his enclosure he would scoop they up gently and peer at they before let they go tragically he die of heart attack after have tooth extract in and his statue be much love by london zoo visitor today the second be goldie the eagle remember that in when be in primary school goldie escape we become obsess with goldie for almost fortnight he appear on tv and in the press and be cheer wildly even when mention in this place in the house of commons some people cause traffic jam around regent park as he fly from tree to tree after day and and half hour he be finally recapture and bring back to the zoo the only quagga to ever have be photograph alive be at london zoo there be officially five photo of quagga provide the only insight into what live quagga look like after the specie become extinct in thousand of quagga once graze the plain of southern africa today they provide reminder of the importance of wildlife conservation pipaluk male polar bear be bear at london zoo on december he be the only male polar bear cub successfully rear at the zoo the name pipaluk mean little one be choose from list of inuit name pipaluk parent who have arrive from moscow zoo in as young cub be call sam and sally they be name after the zoo bear keeper sam morton and his fiancée pipaluk leave london zoo in when the mappin terrace which house all the bear be closed and very sadly die at the age of in zoo in poland my hon friend be give we fantastic story of the remarkable work that london zoo be do do he have any statistic about the number of animal it have be able to protect and return to the wild through its amazing conservation operation the reality be that there be animal of various specie in the zoo suspect would try your patience mr deputy speaker be to list all of they but will talk about some of they jumbo the elephant be believe to have be bear in he arrive at the jardin des plantes zoo in paris when he be still very small and in he be send to london zoo on arrival there he be in dreadful condition but after he be place in the care of matthew scott former antelope keeper jumbo flourish he be so famous he have have lasting impact on the english language help to make jumbo synonym for big female african elephant alice arrive few month after jumbo and the two elephant become associate in the public mind jumbo be soon train to give ride and become great favourite largely because he have such good nature by the early he be nearly foot tall sadly jumbo be kill in railway accident in canada in order do not wish to appear churlish and the hon gentleman will be fully aware that have personal interest in these matter but it would be helpful if he be to relate the catalogue to the reason for extend the lease thank you mr deputy speaker will take your remark into account the reality be that among the well over animal at the zoo be many endanger specie that could not be preserve be the zoo to cease operate if we do not extend the lease the zoo will not continue endangered specie there include the annam leaf turtle the asiatic lion the lake oku claw frog the mountain chicken the northern white cheek gibbon the philippine crocodile the ring tail lemur the sumatran tiger of which there be only leave in the world the waldrapp ibis various specie of gorilla all of which be endanger the white naped mangabey the chinese giant salamander and finally pangolin very much hope that the bill be pass and that by extend the lease we can secure the future of these endanger animal be that not to happen though what be plan for the zoological society for the maintenance of its programme and indeed for the future of the animal its staff currently look after have not mention the immense zoological research do at the zoo by world famous scientist for example darwin perform research at london zoo he might not have come up with the theory of evolution without the zoo currently thousand of scientist at the zoo do brilliant work and conduct wonderful research recommend that any colleague interested in zoological research visit the zoo and see some of the work be do there and urge they to recognise that be the zoo not to have visitor attraction that bring in revenue it would cease to exist if we do not extend the lease the zoo will continue to run down it will not have the investment that it require and it will be unable to continue its excellent work unless we pass the bill and it become law the zoo will not be able to raise the money that it need to do all that wonderful work and preserve endanger specie across the world which will unfortunately become extinct that be the harsh reality and that be why the bill be so important let end by remind members of the vital contribution that london zoo and the zoological society of london have make to our world over the last year as have say charles darwin conduct many of his study at london zoo and without it we would not have the theory of evolution another notable character connect with the zoo be winnie the pooh lieutenant harry colebourn be member of the royal canadian army veterinary corps during the great war and while travel across canada to join his regiment and serve in the war he buy female black bear cub in white river ontario from hunter who have kill her mother colebourn name the bear winnie after his then home town the city of winnipeg and when his regiment be send by train to england in winnie accompany he she become pet and an unofficial mascot to the canadian infantry brigade during its time on salisbury plain colebourn be not however permit to take she with he when the brigade be deploy to the battlefield of france he leave she in the keeping of london zoo on december hop to return after the war to reclaim she colebourn serve heroically during the war rise to the rank of captain although he visit his beloved winnie when he be on leave from france he ultimately decide that the zoo be the good place for she to live and in he donate she permanently in gratitude for her care among the child of london who continue to be smite by winnie in the come year be young boy call christopher robin who repeatedly beg his father the author milne to take he to the zoo he would feed winnie spoonful of condense milk in between big furry hug and from that come the story of winnie the pooh as we know the late queen be great fan of winnie the pooh as well may ask my hon friend whether the zoo have current royal patron and if so who it be the king be of course greatly enamoured of both wildlife and london zoo and be therefore delighted that he have give king consent to the bill but the actual royal the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant be chuntere from sedentary position will take an intervention from he if he will be good enough to make one it be really sort of point of order do not think it appropriate for anyone present piece of legislation to claim the monarch support or otherwise that be not what royal confirmation mean thank the hon gentleman for his intervention obviously we want to ensure that we proceed effectively and properly and take his point and will adapt my remark accordingly in two year time it will be the bicentenary of the zoological society of london be we not be rather churlish in discuss only an extension of the lease why do we not let the society have the freehold of london zoo my hon friend and share the view that leasehold should be abolish completely with freehold the norm and commonhold in flat however the zoo be part of the crown estate so this be matter for the crown estate if the freehold be to be negotiate between the crown estate and the society that too would be matter for they but it go beyond the scope of the bill the crown estate have discretion to provide either an extension or freehold the government be enable those with long lease to acquire freehold why be the government not ensure that the zoo can have the freehold why be there one standard for crown estate property and another standard for private landlord rise order the hon gentleman be absolutely correct to say that that go slightly wide than the scope of the bill under discussion take his point but that be perhaps matter for another day thank you mr deputy speaker take your guidance agree with my hon friend that that could and should be potentially negotiate that is of course matter for discussion with the crown estate it may well be that follow the general election and new parliament we might consider take that forward in future bill and future debate but for today the debate be about the extension of the lease along with number of other member have be involve with the society of antiquaries discussion with the department for levelling up housing and communities about extend the society lease be very pleased that it successfully secure year lease extension be similar length consider when my hon friend be put together the bill thank my hon friend for that intervention we start with provision to extend the lease from its current form to year the investor who be approach by zsl to consider whether that would allow they to do what be require say no this be not enough it would take minimum of year so it be fair to say that in the negotiation between the department zsl and we have come to compromise of an extension to the lease of year be the department and the crown estate so minded we could look at year lease extension but that be what the bill sponsor request and what be pleased to propose hope the house will go along with that proposal and that it can be put into law and come to fruition after the other place have have look at it if there be then another suggestion that we go for much long lease that can be the subject of yet another bill in the new parliament and we could take that forward if require at the moment it be not require but as we know year be effectively freehold if any one of we be homeowner we will know that periodic renovation be require to refresh commercial offering or our own home it give some cause for concern that the bill be base on the premise of single renovation of the offer at regent park my hon friend suggest that the full year extension be require to secure the current round of investment be it not rather shortsighted to bring forward bill that solve only today problem and be blind to the entirely foreseeable problem that will come in or perhaps year thank my hon friend for that intervention how long lease extension will be grant for be obviously matter for debate the decision on how much funding be require be matter for the operator who be consider what they want to do and why they want to do it clearly matter may change in the future but that be what be require to do the work that be require over lengthy period believe that they have make the right assessment thing can change in which case that would lead think to another negotiation and another consideration of what else be require however year lease extension allow substantial investment to be make over number of year so as matter change the investment can be call down utilise and build upon will end my remark there thank everybody for listen and for their intervention look forward to hear colleague include the shadow minister and my hon friend the minister it be huge pleasure to speak on third reading congratulate my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman on pilot this bill on subject that have be passion of his for some time and be hopeful not only that we will give the bill its third reading today but that it will sail through the other place my hon friend have set out pretty well the reason why this matter but think it worth add some point on the strength of london zoo in what it bring to wildlife not just in this country but around the world and why the extension of the lease matter sympathise with concern about whether we should be look to change the act to allow for freehold in this situation but we have to be pragmatic in what we do my understanding be that the crown estate standard lease for building be year and as consequence that be the sensible conclusion that my hon friend have put into the bill there be good reason for that as have already be outline in term of the potential not only to generate fund to undertake redevelopment but to predict the future income necessary for many of the zoo activity one thing that right hon and hon member may not be aware of be that several london zoo building have have to be close some have be close in order then to provide well environment good example be the reptile house it close in october last year and brand new reptile experience be open over the easter recess must admit that while bearded dragon may be lovely and glamourous be not particularly fan of snake but have overcome the fear that mean could not even look at picture of snake nevertheless the environment and habitat be absolutely key if those animal be to prosper and the amount of careful work require be not cheap other building have simply be close london zoo have two list building that need to be maintain to certain standard and as we know the cost of do so seem ever increase people should not think that london zoo can carry on as it be in the zsl council actually order that london zoo be close because it be lose money that would have be devastating for this great city of london and for the zsl give the work that it do not just in this country but around the world that be why be pleased that we have make the progress that we have ultimately london zoo have to generate income in order to ensure that it can continue to function and operate on redevelopment certain building have be close simply because they be not necessarily safe either for the animal or for human so it be important that new source of finance go into london zoo to ensure that the environment for animal be the good it can be and that it can be visitor attraction be sure that my hon friend the minister will explain that the zoo be the most visit attraction in our great capital but there have of course be significant investment beyond london when the elephant house be close down for example an appropriate environment be set up at whipsnade zoo to reaccommodate they the department for environment food and rural affairs hire the mappin pavilion last year when give speech on the progress of the year environment plan of course this be do primarily for the animal but it have to be attractive so that the organisation can thrive and raise fund my hon friend the member for harrow east talk extensively about the research that be carry out this be vital part of zoo it be only just over year ago that this zoo could have close for the sake of global diversity it be essential that we see our zoo thrive and all the facility that go with that and as say the underpinning research my hon friend refer to the programme on sumatran tiger one of the most endangered specie in the world mr deputy speaker have the great privilege last year of feed one of those sumatran tiger have to admit that it be somewhat at arm length understandably and through bar but it be an amazing experience we need to recognise that the work that happen in this country support the work that be be do around the world and that be why shall continue to support any zoo in particular it be why have be so keen to support my hon friend bill and to make sure that london zoo have an opportunity not only to keep these animal alive and well but to thrive congratulate my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman on bring forward this bill and on the amazing way that he deal with so many intervention on range of technicality that have push not only his knowledge but the knowledge of all of we in respect of london zoo we know that zoo have change very much over the year they be far from be what they once be some of we would think they be cruel place where animal be keep in condition that would now be deem unacceptable we have proud record in this country of zoo and safari park be place of education protection conservation and enjoyment the london zoological society might be bit of trek for many from my constituency of darlington think our near zoo be at flamingo land near pickering in the constituency of my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake this debate be an excellent opportunity to highlight to my constituent who be come to london for whatever reason that they could add london zoo to the list of place that they want to visit know that much of the work that our zoo do particularly london zoo be groundbreake and vital to conservation they ensure that the child of the future can see animal such as nelly the elephant bilbo the baboon fletchie the flamingo and indeed patronella the pangolin to observe their beauty and learn more about these amazing creature but we must ensure that worry about london zoo lease be put to rest while prepare for this debate it have be quite fascinating to learn that london zoo be lead the way in protect pangolin which be the most trafficked animal in the world with one be poach almost every five minute london zoo be lead partner in their protection restoration and ecosystem and work alongside those live with these beautiful shy and critically endanger creature the work on pangolin be great example of the international reach of our precious asset of london zoo wonder what the need be for that protection why be pangolin so endangered and what be it that we be do in london and internationally to protect they know very little about pangolin but what have read in preparation for this debate would indicate that they be traffic for their scale and meat in the far east when attend the convention on international trade in endangered species conference back in pangolin be the big issue as my hon friend rightly say people assume that their scale be of benefit but they be also delicacy pangolin be brilliant at protect themselves against predator by roll up into ball unfortunately that make they the easy animal to pick up and poach and that be why the ongoing work be so critical be grateful to my right hon friend for her clarification it be right that we do much in this place to protect animal include the dog and cat that we have do so much good work for already this morning by pass the pet abduction bill indeed through relatively dry bill about lease reform and the crown estate we can do something that help conservation around the world we must help to ensure that london zoo can continue its good work by amend the crown estate act and increase the society lease on that land to year then anxietie about its tenure can go away and the society can continue to be place of enjoyment lead the way in all it do be pleased to support the bill it be pleasure to speak in this debate and congratulate my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman on the progress make on the bill which have all our support of course we should extend the lease to echo the point that have be make about london zoo it be year old the old zoo in the world it have humble beginning be sure as sort of entertainment for the public and it have become an incredibly important conservation charity of great global importance while my hon friend be speak think of how as barbarism take over the world learning and culture retreat into the medieval monastery it be almost as if the endanger specie of the world have be save by some of these zoological institution and be then able to return it be interested to hear about the specie that have be save or preserve kingfisher tiger the quagga well be sorry to hear that the zoo do not in fact help to save the quagga but at least it have some photograph of it which be encouraging do not know about the mountain chicken and have no idea of the story of winnie the pooh be only sorry that winnie do not stay on salisbury plain which be part of my constituency where we would have give he or her happy life it be very good thing that winnie end up in london zoo and we can all be very proud of that commend the bill the zoo be an historic institution which be one of the reason we should be so proud of it and it have very bright future be encourage to hear from my hon friend about the plan for the zoo be not aware that matthew gould have take over as chief executive know he slightly when be civil servant at the department for culture media and sport and he be in charge of the nation digital policy it be amazing how people move around in our elite why should he not be run the zoo he be obviously do great job and commend the plan for it that hear about and the skill that he bring from his background be interested and inspire by what hear about the modernisation of the zoo it be look forward and use digital skill and immersive technology to give visitor an enhance experience that get they close to the reality of the natural habitat that these animal come from and to which we hope that they or their descendant will be able to return what hear be encouraging totally agree with my hon friend argument that to raise the capital that be need for long term investment on the site the investor who finance that work will need certainty that the zoo will be around long enough this change be the right thing to do and echo the point that it would be nice if the zoo be there in perpetuity with freehold commend the bill be pleased that member across the house support it and will be happy to do so myself it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for devizes danny kruger he give an excellent speech and must say that there be certain air of victorian zookeeper about he today it be pleasure to speak in favour of the bill which support congratulate my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman on bring it forward it be the right thing to do this be very small piece of legislation tiny blip on the legislative agenda only few line long but it be important that we amend the crown estate act to increase the maximum term of lease as we have hear the change we be make do not automatically grant zsl lease of year but crucially be look at the minister it allow the department to offer this length of lease in the future this be important for so many reason as be capably cover by the previous speaker it be uk institution but also groundbreaker internationally as the world first scientific zoo the zoological society of london be an international conservation charity that save animal that be on the brink of extinction protect specie and restore ecosystem it be also much more than that as my hon friend the member for harrow east describe the tourism that zsl london zoo bring to the uk be phenomenal it provide million to our economy every year and that be just its specific impact on tourism there be its wide tourism pull as one of many institution in london that tourist come to my hon friend constituency in milton keynes be far close and much well connect to london than mine wonder if he know how many of his constituent visit london zoo and whether school in milton keynes north engage with the zoo to learn about its conservation work that be fantastic intervention the short answer be no so there be huge opportunity for to investigate whether school in milton keynes north have take the chance to visit zsl london zoo the educational benefit would be superb on my hon friend point about connectivity and get to the zoo from his constituency and mine can only assume that he have not try avanti train recently on occasion be not sure that the journey from darlington would be much slow than the journey from milton keynes london zoo be one of the many attraction educational leisure or otherwise in london but it can be proud of its position as the most popular tourist attraction in london the zoo be about more than just education and tourism core function of its output be conservation and it have global reach it have conservation activity in over country worldwide we have see the reintroduction of many specie all that work be bear out of the premise that we seek to support through this lease extension on species reintroduction think in particular of the reintroduction of the partula snail on conservation breeding programme think obviously of the northern bald ibis species that have not be mention yet and the fen raft spider the conservation breeding programme occur partly due to the reintroduction of the partula snail the work do with conservationist in other country have mean huge increase in support for wide reintroduction programme such as for griffon vulture hihi bird and amur tiger we have already hear about goldie the eagle and the story behind winnie the pooh jumbo the elephant it be news to that he add the word jumbo to our vocabulary and guy the gorilla be amuse to hear that guy the gorilla only understand french and that there be now statue rise will give way on foreign gorilla it be obviously matter of deep concern for the house that guy the gorilla speak only french mean to intervene on my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman to ask whether guy at the end of his life be bilingual we will never know but perhaps clue can be find in whether the statue of guy the gorilla be wear beret this change to section of the crown estate act this small tweak to the lease length will allow london zoo to operate in much more future proof way it have ambition to create the world first campus for nature it want to reimagine the zoo as series of natural landscape and as my hon friend the member for harrow east mention it want to make the zoo truly accessible for all that go to the heart of what we be do we want to share the benefit with everybody for generation thank my hon friend for give way on that issue one of the ground for give zsl planning permission for further work be that it would make available facility for people with special need and child from the local area who could use both the garden area and other zoo premise at reduce price as mention allow local people with special need to come in for be great contribution to allow community access as we pursue these change it be vital that community access continue be grateful for that intervention which lead to my winding up can carry on if the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant wish to the zoo be jewel in the crown of not just london tourism but conservation generally if we succeed in this attempt to allow it to extend its lease and bring in finance to secure its physical asset the site and its conservation and education work do here in london and across the world that will be of benefit to generation to come join in congratulate my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman on bring the bill to this stage hopefully it will pass today and make its way through to become law it be yet another private member bill that he have successfully shepherd through the house will have to get some tip from he on how to follow his lead and come high in the ballot recognise the important role that the zoological society of london play as an international conservation charity it restore wildlife in the uk and around the world save animal threaten with extinction protect specie and ecosystem and conduct lot of research internationally with partner it also play fundamental role in inspire the next generation of conservationist which be obviously key we be here to talk about the impact that the bill could have on the zoo and that bring we to the animal in january the annual stocktake take place at london zoo which be no mean feat give that it be home to over different specie from the endanger galapagos giant tortoise we hear about tortoise in an early debate and asiatic lion to critically endanger chinese giant salamander and sumatran tiger it be very good news that three asiatic lion cub be bear only few week ago that be major boost to conservation give that there be only around to such lion live in the wild people will be reassure that the annual stocktake which involve check how many animal there be and that they be still in the zoo be part of the licence requirement to which the zoo be subject in order to ensure public protection the kernel of this bill be about safeguard the future of zsl and its important work the society have be very clear about the effect of the current lease limitation particularly on its ability to fundraise and create new partnership that will enable it to enhance its work include the support programme that be available and the great community programme that my hon friend the member for harrow east talk about such as discretionary access and cheap ticket for local people to come to the zoo and see what be on offer the benefit that long lease would offer have also be set out by the society as we consider extend the lease it be obviously important that we capture those benefit and then hold the society to account on deliver they should it be grant the lease at its core it be about have the world first campus for nature with centre of research and innovation that be dedicate to protect biodiversity and strengthen nature but it be also about enhance technology come across matthew gould when he be head of nhsx where he do lot of work in develop app and technology in the nhs bring that knowledge and insight to the zoo in order to have more immersive experience would be highly commendable the zoo be also look at accessibility my hon friend the member for harrow east talk about the offer to local community but this be world institution it be one of the most visited attraction in the country and want my constituent in north west norfolk include child and people with special need to be able to benefit from such offer there be obviously travel cost involve but come to see such great facility be invaluable for they as it happen my first date with my wife be at london zoo you animal check out my surname we have lovely time and obviously it pay off my wife and be at the zoo few week ago with one of her friend and her young twin and its ability to inspire be incredible watch those two little girl run off to look at the animal and it be great when my wife and go on our first date which be some time ago we be bit concerned about the state of the facility some of the cage have sign to assure visitor that the animal be not in distress even though they may have be pace backwards and forwards there be an urgent need for modernisation and when go back few week ago note that some of the enclosure have be improve be think in particular of the penguin area which be now great facility and one of my favourite part of the zoo few member have speak about guy the gorilla understand that his tooth decay be cause by he be feed sweet by people visit the zoo so it be very important that only zookeeper should feed the animal it be important to get that on the record gorilla be herbivore so they should only be feed by keeper as my hon friend rightly say they should certainly not be feed sweet do he realise that gorilla share of their dna with human being they be very close to human being just as tooth decay in human be concern particularly among young child who eat sweet the same thing apply to gorilla my hon friend make very interesting observation bet guy could get dentist from sedentary position the hon gentleman mention dentistry could talk about the need for more dentist and dental van in north west norfolk but that would obviously be beyond the scope of this debate will not encourage you to stand up to make be quiet mr deputy speaker as my hon friend the member for milton keynes north ben everitt have point out this be an enable power there be no guarantee of an extension with that come back to the plan put forward by the zsl to convince people that it be deserve of this extension it will be hold to account and so it will be able to go off to raise the fund to enhance this world class facility to conclude have open in the zoo will soon be celebrate year this important bill will help to ensure that it continue to play the crucial role it have have since then in protect animal by provide well enclosure and well facility for they and ensure that vital research continue while remain lead visitor attraction where people can come to learn more about our wonderful world call sir chris bryant concur thank my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman for introduce this bill on the zsl and the maximum lease term that may be grant to it which have now reach its concluding stage in the commons also wish to thank my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope for cast his beady expert eye over the bill and for not move his amendment which lead to degree of shock and perhaps even gentle chaos that should be see as tribute to his fearsome reputation for ruthless and relentless scrutiny would like to see that mantle of scrutiny take up by my hon friend the members for devizes danny kruger for broadland jerome mayhew for north west norfolk james wild for milton keynes north ben everitt and for darlington peter gibson and my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey it be good to hear her particular expertise as former environment secretary thank they for their scrutiny of the bill the amendment from my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope be about differentiate between residential area within the zoo and other property obviously some discussion have take place that be not privy to so would be grateful if the minister elaborate on what residential property there be within the zoo and whether they be purely there for the zookeeper obviously there be no work time directive for animal as believe one of my colleague say so there be case to be make in that regard but it would be good to understand little more about the footprint of the residential area will come on to that later in my speech understand that we be talk about three property but will probably contradict myself later the department for culture media and sport be the government sponsor of this bill and our interest lie in the location of london zoo in regent park where the propose extension of the maximum lease term grantable will be enact regent park be under the management of the royal parks charity which be sponsor by my department ultimately the eight royal park be own by the crown with responsibility for they rest with the secretary of state for culture media and sport take an interest also as london member of parliament as the tourism minister my hon friend the member for harrow east mention that the zoo be an important part of the visitor economy both locally and nationally and as have two young child who would benefit from visit this tremendous attraction we have recognise the importance of london zoo as tourist attraction in its own right but what be the minister thought about its fit with the wide tourist ecosystem within london and within the uk this debate have prove that simply by talk about london zoo we can learn about all the other animal base visitor attraction across the country include flamingo land near darlington the bill propose small amendment to the crown estate act to extend the maximum lease grantable to the zsl from year to year although the lease be most recently renew in by the current maximum term of year as any well manage and forward think organisation should do the zsl wish far to extend the maximum lease term in order to secure long term investment and to continue to develop the historic site at regent park in an early intervention talk about the campaign that number of colleague be involve in on burlington house where lot of expert society be base the freehold for that be the responsibility of the department for levelling up housing and communities we finally get agreement from the relevant minister there to extend the lease to year would be interested in any reflection that this minister have on the comparison between that length of time and the year propose in the bill my understanding which have gain during the course of this debate be that the year lease be specific to the crown estate imagine that be for all sort of historical reason but be happy to go into those by write to my hon friend the government view the extension of the maximum lease term grantable to be relatively uncontroversial change that will positively impact the organisation allow it to build its resilience develop strategic philanthropic relationship and increase the scope of potential commercial partnership that will ensure its continue growth it be also important to note that establish the mechanism for long lease term will bring the zoological society of london into line with similar organisation that hold lease on crown estate land include the royal botanic gardens at kew the maximum allowable lease for the royal botanic gardens in respect of land in kew garden be extend from year to year follow the introduction of bill in grant maximum lease term of year to the zoological society of london will significantly and positively impact the organisation aim for example the society be at the forefront of effort to reverse biodiversity loss which be one of the big challenge of our time long lease will allow for the creation of the world first campus for nature trans disciplinary centre of research and innovation dedicate to the protection of biodiversity and strengthen nature it will also help to reimagine the zoo landscape provide ecosystem drive space design with an understanding of how each animal now thrive and provide the assurance that our most at risk specie will be care for and protect well into the future we talk lot in this house and in committees sit on the environmental audit committee about the challenge of biodiversity net loss across the world as well as in this nation about of biodiversity have be lose since be bear in but lot of that be drive by climate change would the minister be able to expand little on the zoo plan to deal with climate change in its educational programme while also deal with it in its programme to protect the long term future of those specie my understanding be that part of the zoo offer in relation to this lease extension be that it will deepen its partnership and relationship with some of the nearby institution include local university and other scientific institution imagine that that share learning will help to advance our understanding of climate change and its impact on biodiversity should also note that this government through the environment act bring in the concept of biodiversity net gain with the impact of construction on wildlife offset by commitment from developer to enhance our local environment the zoological society of london future aim be befit of an organisation of its high calibre the society will extend and contribute to london knowledge quarter which have just refer to an established landscape of world lead science and research institution that span from camden town to holborn and covent garden the zoological society of london have always work closely with its neighbour other world class institution include university college london and the royal veterinary college the society wish to deepen those connection to form network of learning knowledge sharing and scientific exploration and practice we be confident that the society have the ambition expertise place and drive to realise the opportunity ahead and bring this amazing special campus to life as conservation zoo both london zoo and its sister site at whipsnade care for more extinct in the wild specie than any other zoo in the uk london zoo be part of vital breeding programme for more than endanger specie from the socorro dove to the sumatran tiger limit the maximum grantable lease term to year would curtail the magnitude of the zoo impact as we have hear today london zoo animal have inspire lifelong love of animal in its visitor for over two century some notable name include winnie an american black bear deposit at the zoo in at the start of the first world war as my hon friend the member for harrow east have set out she be visit by milne and his son christopher and to this day live on in the story of winnie the pooh and christopher robin as we have hear there be also guy the gorilla speak of lyrically by my hon friend throughout the course of this debate we have consistently refer to he as guy the gorilla however he speak french so surely it should be pronounce ghee that surely have to be one of the good intervention on record apologise but must correct the record should have pronounce guy the gorilla lyrically like my hon friend that be go in hansard that be true as we have hear guy the gorilla would at first respond only to french have spend the six month precede his arrival in parisian zoo his statue remain much love by the zoo visitor we have hear about goldie the eagle but add to this collection my admiration for ricky the rockhopper penguin whom meet when be keeper for the day now find myself head to google the quagga which have not hear of before the touching account of the life of jumbo the elephant bring solitary tear to my eye that be quickly wipe away by the tale from my hon friend the member for north west norfolk of how the wild animal of london zoo light inside his heart his inner wild animal the department for culture media and sport recognise the immense value that the zoological society of london have within london and the nation at large and wish to support all initiative to ensure it have strong future throughout its year history london zoo have solidify its reputation as an important and unique part of our capital heritage culture and tourism offer it be the capital most visit attraction and contribute more than million annually to the local economy and more than million to the national economy it be also the world old scientific zoo operate since and world lead force in wildlife conservation and biodiversity charles darwin with his significant contribution to our understanding of science become fellow of the zoological society of london in during his time at london zoo he study the behaviour of animal and develop his revolutionary theory today darwin history be safeguard in london zoo library and the zoo also safeguard the pangolin on which there have be extensive debate the issue be close to my heart as my niece and nephew hold successful pangolin bake sale when they be most in the news they be as we have discuss the world most trafficked animal just to clarify for members that be because of their value as bush meat and as delicacy and their scale be use in traditional medicine and their skin be use for boot and belt my hon friend be be generous in give way the chief executive of the zoological society of london have say how the bill will secure the future of zsl and london zoo ensure that they continue to inspire and educate million to do world lead science and conservation and to keep strong an important and much love institution do she have sense of the scale of the investment that extend the lease will unlock in term of the modernisation and improvement that will come from the world class research facility that will be create through the bill as we have hear from my hon friend the member for harrow east the bill will unlock substantial investment in the site it will lead to the renovation of historic list building but also the creation of new more appropriate habitat now that we understand more about the animal that they contain firmly believe that the zoo be historical asset worth championing and protect for future generation from its beginning many lead architect have contribute to the zoo build environment the collection of building include two grade and eight grade ii and grade ii list structure the grade list penguin enclosure design in the international modernist style by berthold lubetkin and construct in be describe by historic england as key symbol of british and international modern movement architecture advance in our understanding of animal welfare have show that many of the current structure within the zoo premise be simply no long suitable for their intend purpose although the zoo have achieve many first include the first reptile house public aquarium insect house and child zoo work be ongoing to reimagine those space in innovative and sustainable way throughout the zoological society of london effort will ensure its central aim of conservation and care for endangered specie remain at the core the work of the society and the zoo support the environmental principle outline in the environment act the continue existence of the zoo will preserve wildlife and other natural asset within its build environment and champion measure to reduce biodiversity loss it be also important to note that the extension of the lease do not equate to extension of land occupy and the remainder of regent park will be unaffected by the change there be reason to question our support of this bill in respect of the impact on the public purse take this chance to confirm that neither the zoological society of london nor london zoo specifically receive any grant in aid from the government while the society be the recipient of research grant from research england the foreign commonwealth and development office and the department for environment food and rural affairs for international and domestic conservation work those be apply for through official programme there would therefore be no significant impact on government funding or accrual of public debt if the organisation maximum lease term be to be extend as charity the zoological society of london raise the vast majority of its income from its member and visitor to its conservation zoo include london zoo additional field project include its community access initiative and rhino bond scheme be fund through partnership with funder across the globe look forward in london zoo will celebrate year since its opening and be sure be not alone in wish it success in the next year continue modernisation and redevelopment will allow its animal to thrive include through the development of the biodiversity campus to champion the need of nature across sector and to increase public engagement and learn opportunity in addition to benefit its animal research and scientific aim an extension of the zoological society of london lease for london zoo will provide essential opportunity to access nature respite and wellbee for people of all age and every background in the february half term last year london zoo community access scheme enable over people on low income and other benefit to access the zoo for only accessibility be core aim of the zoo which also run audio describe tour sign language tour and early opening morning aim at autistic and neurodiverse visitor over school student visit the zoo each year learn about wildlife conservation and the effect of climate change and plastic pollution protect the future of this organisation through the extension of the maximum lease term make sure that it will continue to educate and inspire the next generation the government be commit to support the zoological society of london ambition to improve and invest to secure its continue role as leader in the field extend the lease term be part of that much need support we be sure that the bill will offer the necessary support and protection to the zoological society of london and london zoo be very pleased to affirm our support for the bill and once again thank my hon friend the member for harrow east for bring it to the house with the leave of the house thank my hon friend the minister for her contribution today and her support throughout

blessing must also thank my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope who manage to propose an amendment to reduce the lease and then during his speech argue in favour of extend the lease know we often take contradictory position in debate and he manage to do that today be grateful to he for not press his amendment and so allow we to move on to third reading draw the house attention to one of the problem raise during the debate that because of its inefficient building london zoo energy cost rise from million in to million the following year the fact be that these old building house many endanger specie that need consistently high temperature tiger can not put jumper on or fill hot water bottle they have to be provide with the heating appropriate to their specie thank matthew gould and his team for invite to take the bill through its commons stage reiterate my thank to the public bill office for its help support and guidance during the bill progress to my office and to my parliamentary assistant hattie shoosmith for her help in formulate my speech also thank the member who serve on the bill committee my hon friend the member for clwyd south simon baynes the hon member for coatbridge chryston and bellshill steven bonnar my hon friend the member for congleton fiona bruce the hon member for rotherham sarah champion my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal my hon friend the members for copeland trudy harrison and for penrith and the border dr hudson the minister for media tourism and creative industries my hon friend the member for

hon friend the member for north herefordshire sir bill wiggin and my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright all those member give their support and although we be not able to have full second reading debate think we have test the bill both in committee and very thoroughly on third reading hope that it will now be pass without dissent and that we can wish it godspeed through the other place no doubt their lordship will look at the hansard report of our deliberation and allow it to proceed so that we can safeguard london zoo for the enjoyment of people long after we have all leave this earth we all welcome its conservation work and scientific research and of course the joy that people gain from visit it to see endangered specie and specie that they would never see otherwise except on their television screen and we all want to preserve that we wish the bill well we wish london zoo well with its work and trust that we can ensure that the lease be extend as we wish it to be question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass off road vehicles registration bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time have always believe that politician and political party should show leadership rather than simply follow public opinion and that that leadership should be base on well know value principle and policy that have be communicate at the time of election however also believe that if it become clear that something be have detrimental impact on our constituent it be our job to listen to they and do whatever we can to alleviate any suffering the bill may stand in my name but present it in honour of my constituent who lose his life when he be strike by an off road vehicle david gow also know as davie die on february do not get to meet davie but know his brother allan and meet his son craig when he approach some time after his father death craig gow tell that his dad have be cross the road to reach his home in high possil when he be strike on the road by an off road vehicle that fact be not in dispute an arrest be make but no charge have be bring so will say no more about what happen that day which mean that can not go into detail about why think that the bill would certainly reduce if not prevent altogether the incidence of similar tragedy what will say be that davie gow never get to celebrate his birthday and his family be leave devastate want to take moment to celebrate mr gow life by use the word of his son craig who say could be here all day firstly he be devoted family man loyal friend and fiercely independent and extremely intelligent man full of life and full of carry on carry on be glaswegian for fun suppose craig also say his father be real man man he love game of dominoes and good crossword or quiz show and when young he be right good football player miss he every day and know always will mr gow die where he have live in the flat that have previously be high possil school where he have be educate as have his father also david gow his grandchild cameron and jessica live nearby three generation of the gow family either live in the area or spend year be educate in the spot where mr gow die he take great contentment from the fact that they all live in the area and hope his family can gain some peace from know that his death be not in vain and that he have motivate to introduce the bill join my hon friend in offer condolence to the gow family not least to councillor allan gow david brother and constituent of mine tragic accident such as these can often be avoid and if registration scheme be in place the police could much more easily track down and identify vehicle owner to ensure justice can be do while be sure that many member will want to speak about their experience we should acknowledge the work of our colleague in the scottish parliament bob doris who have take up these issue on behalf of the gow family and other constituent in the north of glasgow thank my hon friend for those word and echo what he say about our colleague bob doris and councillor allan gow constituent in glasgow north east have be call email and message about the antisocial and completely improper use of off road vehicle be that off road motorbike quad bike or high power electric motorcycle they simply can not get peace from they thus my bill call for the compulsory registration of all off road vehicle commend the hon lady for bring this bill forward because she have identify an important issue the use of off road motorbike especially but also of high power bike battery bike be problem in leyland be recently subject to some quite unpleasant antisocial behaviour from what look like young man on off road bike with no registration have to follow they into the back of the leyland estate and in be so discourteous to the people of leyland they nearly knock child down do the hon lady agree that anybody go out on the road on vehicle that they should not be on should think very hard agree with the hon lady although electric bike be not yet include in the bill accord to my mother who be anybody on bicycle should have to have registration plate so that she can report they to the police when they whizz past disorientate she on the pavement have say to she not include that mum but join the hon lady in urge user of all power vehicle and all pedal bike to be courteous and aware of pedestrian to be clear the bill be not ban or clampdown on fun know well be tell that off road biking be fun and would like there to be somewhere possibly in my constituency for people who use they for fun to be able to do so safely without disturb the peace for resident also know that there be people who use they legitimately in their line of work such as farmer and construction worker this bill be not about they it be about the people who choose to use off road vehicle antisocially dangerously and completely improperly will explain what mean by that when share the experience of some of my constituent compulsory registration scheme could help to alleviate the widespread theft of off road vehicle from both rural and urban area so my proposal could benefit those who use off road vehicle correctly get those vehicle register would hardly be the big deal in the world in fact that would most likely take place when they be initially purchase from dealer much like the way our car be register we all have to do paperwork that we do not want to do but if it be for the benefit of the wide community surely that be not too much to ask when we say off road vehicle in the bill we be talk about any vehicle specifically design to be use off road suppose the clue be in the title such as quad bike trail bike scrambler and four wheeled motorised buggy the bill give the secretary of state the scope to define that in non exhaustive list the hon member for south ribble katherine fletcher mention electric bike which have become contentious as the technology move on there be consultation on they at the moment this bill will include electric motorcycle but not electric bicycle which use electric motor as an aid to pedal power however if it be feel at some point in the future that the power in those bike be sufficient to require registration the bill would allow they to be include by future secretary of state the bill call for all off road vehicle to be register in much the same way as car it call for an identify mark to be require on each of these vehicle similar to car registration plate but tailor to the size and shape of the vehicle we need to consult on how they might be fix to the vehicle and how that might affect their normal operation the reason be determined that registration be display be that if we see car without registration plate it will be immediately apparent that something be not right it grab our attention and more importantly that of the police it need to become the norm for off road vehicle to have visible mark so that if it be remove or replace and do not match an identify mark from the body of the bike the police can do something about it the bill have scope for an exemptions list have deliberately keep that open because much as have consult the secretary of state will be in far well position to fully consult user note that there be some concern in farming community exemption could be make for those who use the vehicle in association with professional sporting body motorsport be expensive and anything that add to the cost of enjoy it or deter people from take part must be take into consideration have consult widely with my constituent who reply to my campaign in their hundred they be overwhelmingly in favour of the bill for reason that will chime with many member here child be unable to play outside because these vehicle be mount the pavement or race through the play park at speed of up to mph people be unable to sleep because it be happen through the night and the noise become unbearable my constituent be unable to relax in their own home after long day because they can not even hear the tv old people be nervous about go out have talk about my mum but hear from constituent who like to assist their year old visually impair mum on walk with the aid of her stroller they can not do that now because of the number of these bike in the area congratulate the hon lady on bring this very important debate to the house time be limited so want to intervene to welcome the debate she be raise the issue of significant antisocial behaviour offence commit up and down the country we be all aware of they as we discuss early can guarantee that will set up taskforce with the home office and key stakeholder to get to the heart of the issue some recent asb work have be do by the home office but see no reason why we can not build upon that to address this specific issue and the impact it have on community across the country very much appreciate the conversation with the minister and his remark be not somebody who stand here and say demand that the law be change immediately welcome any progress that we can make towards this taskforce be an excellent idea because of course do not have all the answer by bring together expert and the people we need onside to make this work progress will be make put on the record my support for what the hon lady be seek to do many of we in the house be blight by this issue and welcome she bring forward this legislation appreciate that time be short but put on the record my sincere thank for the engagement with the minister and the discussion about bring forward group to look in serious detail at this scourge on our street the hon lady be make an excellent speech and thank she sincerely for the bill thank the hon gentleman before the issue come to my attention he be speak about and campaign on it so thank he for that on behalf of my constituent littlehill golf course in my constituency be fantastic facility not least because it be accessible and affordable to low income family but it regularly become completely unusable when quad biker get in and wreck the green be bring forward this bill because those family deserve to be able to have their leisure time the green be keep beautifully and so much effort be put into they but then someone who nobody can identify come in and wreck they how lucky be my barmulloch constituent to have family of deer and other wildlife in robroyston park in the heart of their urban community in the middle of many tenement they be not so lucky that off road vehicle speed through unfettered at all time of the night and day have scar away the animal it would be tragic if they do not come back my constituent call the police but it be hard to catch the culprit however if they can give the police registration number the police can catch up with the culprit later if not at once if such vehicle do not have registration number their driver be in constant danger of be stop by the police anyway and have their vehicle possibly confiscate even if they be not use they improperly either way the legislation would give the police and my constituent far well chance of identify the culprit the hon lady make an important point about the ability of these vehicle to be register and to display registration plate as means of identification compulsory registration scheme would however provide deterrent to many off road biker seek to abuse their vehicle because they would not be prepare to pay the money to register the vehicle in the first place my intention be not to make registration financially prohibitive but the hon gentleman be right that such scheme would be deterrent in other way if people know they can not go around unidentified any long then they be far less likely to get on to those vehicle in the first place the people of barmulloch balornock wallacewell milton possilpark lambhill springburn and anywhere else in my constituency or anybody else constituency deserve to live in peace and to be safe these be good people because so many of those who reply to express concern about the people on the vehicle while they be angry with they they be also fearful that they too will end up injure or lose their life just as davie gow do end by thank the public bill office for its incredible help be laugh because need lot of help and thank you mr deputy speaker for allow to present the bill in honour of davie gow extend my sympathy and that of the whole house to the family of david gow have suffer personally as result of the action of quad bike and motorbike although my experience pale into insignificance in comparison with the consequence that the gow family have suffer before come into the house run an outdoor leisure company that have location around the united kingdom we be build on new site in an urban park in the north of england but during the construction phase it be terrorise that be the good way to describe it by teenaged boy on quad bike and motorbike they be boy or young man rid through the public park and after the site be open frightening pay member of the public who be walk around it lead to concern fear include fear of injury and increase cost security concern at the site mean that hour dog patrol have to be recruit to protect this perfectly legitimate leisure activity in my newly form constituency of broadland and fakenham visit quite recently the premise of matt pope motorcycles be actually there to help with an issue relate to flooding which sell off road motorcycle during our conversation the owner talk about the risk of break in and of theft of off road motorcycle in part that be because they be not register and do not tend to have vin number as other vehicle do make they much more susceptible to theft even from very legitimate seller such as matt pope motorcycles there be significant problem here be very sympathetic to any legislation that we can collectively bring forward or any progress towards legislation to make it easy to discourage this deeply antisocial behaviour when we consider legislation as we all do in this house there be very obvious two stage test that we should apply first we should ask be the problem that we seek to solve due to lack of power for the enforcement authority or lack of enforcement of power by the enforce body if it be the former and not the latter we move on to the next test which be whether the legislation will solve the problem without do more harm than good we should apply that two stage common sense test to every piece of legislation let turn to the first question be the problem here the lack of power for the police or lack of enforcement of exist power find two relevant section in the road traffic act the first be section under which it be an offence for person driving include on motorcycle and quad bike to cause alarm distress or annoyance to other pedestrian and road user that be very straightforward section deal specifically with off road driving as an aside mr deputy speaker one of the great pleasure of these friday sitting be that the research we have to do in order to make speech give we quite lot of insight into legislation now know mr deputy speaker that you do not commit an offence if you drive off the road but only if you do so within yard of the carriageway and for the purpose of parking it be also interesting that in the unit of measurement use in legislation be yard not metre yet we decimalise in that be slight tangent but it be something that just spring to mind turn back to my argument we have the offence for the police to enforce we see in section of the police reform act what the police can do once that offence have be commit section be the power to stop those miscreant and section be the power to seize the vehicle so the police already have the power to stop and to seize section be the power to use reasonable force to do so section be the power to enter domestic premise to enforce those power if we take those in combination it be pretty clear that this be problem not of police power but of enforcement the question be therefore whether the bill would help to increase enforcement there be very substantial argument that it would for the reason the hon lady give which be that many of we who be expose to this antisocial behaviour would be willing witness to the offence and could take down registration number and supply it to the police it be then an issue of the police act effectively at beat manager level some of what the hon gentleman be talk about would apply in england and wales only that be one point my feeling be that there be so many instance of this behaviour that the police would be keep incredibly busy however an offence of not display registration or of not register one of these vehicle could be preventive as he say the police would have to catch someone not display registration plate only once for the vehicle to be take off they that would save the police from have to chase people multiple time for use the vehicle in antisocial way substantially agree with the hon lady it be worth note in pass that under the police reform act can not bring the section number to mind the police be require to give warning for the first offence it be only when they be satisfied either that warning have be give in similar circumstance in the past month or that warning have be receive and ignore that they move towards use the power that have set out agree that requirement to display registration plate may well act as disincentive to commission that kind of offence that bring we all back to the role of the police and what constitute effective community policing just last week spend morning out on the beat with the police by car to look at some of the crime hotspot in broadland and be very pleased to say that there be any over the last decade and particularly during the tenure of the excellent police and crime commissioner giles orpen smellie crime have fall significantly in broadland be look up the datum and in just the past year crime overall have fall by in norfolk and residential burglary be down by robbery by violence against the person by and stalking and harassment by that just go to show that an effective police and crime commissioner such as giles orpen smellie and police force that focus on antisocial behaviour be gateway crime to other more serious crime and that get involve early on really do make difference as should have say in my speech understand that lot of antisocial behaviour come from have nothing to look forward to and few job prospect will not stand here and say this be all your fault we must get thing right for the primarily young people who be involve in such antisocial behaviour there be load of example in my constituency of get it right such as st paul youth forum which in year have reduce youth offend from case to zero case year there be many more example we have responsibility to ensure that young people have fulfilment excitement and satisfaction in life so that they do not have to use off road vehicle to get that excitement and satisfaction be grateful for that further intervention of course the hon lady be right that parenting be difficult task speak as the not particularly brilliant parent of three child although they be get old now at and be very pleased that get that right at the first time of ask the challenge for every parent no matter where they live in the country be not just to engage their child but to teach they how to make their own entertainment on the point make by my hon friend and the hon member for glasgow north east anne mclaughlin the way ahead be surely the example cite in the debate of my hon friend the member for darlington peter gibson on february by the hon member for north antrim ian paisley who set out in very eloquent term how in north antrim there be pilot project for kid who have the problem identify by the hon lady and passion for off road vehicle passion identify by all of we in various different example there be location where those individual could do that pastime in safe way and there be education on appropriate usage that be surely the way ahead for tackle antisocial behaviour in tricky circumstance the minister be absolutely right of course want to move on but will make one other point yes it can be very boring grow up where activity be not lay on but the vast majority of teenage people do not commit offence they do not choose to create antisocial behaviour we can understand why that may happen but those reason be not an excuse for that kind of behaviour will draw my remark to close be very supportive of the bill hear what the minister say that perhaps taskforce be the right way to develop these idea far and that the bill may not be quite in the form that be most appropriate for legislation but be very supportive of the view behind it will just make technical point if the bill proceed far it should be note that there may be drafting error in clause it refer to section of the vehicle excise and registration act think it may need to refer to section but could be wrong echo the congratulation to my hon friend the member for glasgow north east anne mclaughlin on bring the bill forward recognise her work on this issue over many year and the work of our colleague bob doris in the scottish parliament who have be mention the reason for that work be the experience of our constituent extend my condolence to the family and friend of david gow and particularly his brother allan such tragic accident be the bad manifestation of what can happen but they be not the only outcome of the improper use of off road vehicle there be many near miss or non fatal but life change injury and accident sometimes those injury or fatality involve animal today business begin with question about the treatment and welfare of pet there be also noise and air pollution all of we will have hear our constituent concern about those thing my hon friend remind that have load of constituent do not know how miss this out who say they can no long let their dog run free off the lead when they be out for walk because of off road vehicle that be outrageous so want to mention that people tell that in their dozen be sure those constituent would only be let their dog off the leash in area where that be permit that be regulate by council byelaw that issue be also sometimes source of concern there be concern about the exact use or purpose of the vehicle sometimes their use be about joyride the thrill of the noise and the speed but sometimes the vehicle be use for quick getaway from the scene of perhaps even more serious crime or for the transport of illicit substance off road of course police in on road vehicle be not able to pursue they we have hear about that and many of we will have have personal experience of that regrettably we sometimes see off road vehicle be use along the canal in glasgow to the great concern of many pedestrian and cycle user the new sculpture bella the beithir the mythical animal that have take up residence at the stockingfield bridge do not want to be disturb by the noise of off road vehicle when she be try to sleep my hon friend propose some pretty straightforward and useful reform that would promote much more responsible use of off road vehicle and that would provide the police with additional power to crack down on irresponsible use the burden should not be high she say it will not be high on people who use such vehicle responsibly and for legitimate purpose certainly they should have nothing to fear from the registration system as she say there could be legitimate exemption from the measure in certain circumstance as think the hon member for darlington peter gibson say the bill would also have deterrent effect on those especially young people who do not understand the responsibility that come with own and operate such vehicle importantly the bill would strengthen the police hand considerably it would make it easy to seize unregistered vehicle on the first offence point elaborate on in an exchange of intervention and easy to track vehicle that be be use improperly know from speak to police in the north of glasgow that the lack of power in this area be source of frustration the hon member be make an impassioned speech and put on record my condolence to the gow family there be two point to address some of his issue first there be thousand of law abide user represent by group such as the auto cycle union and the green lane association who would be keen to have the differentiation between the criminal clearly commit antisocial behaviour and other thing and the thousand upon thousand who be act normally the point that want to take away with the taskforce be that there be already of these vehicle up and down the country on the voluntary register it be not very well know that we have that voluntary register and with respect if we could expand it dramatically through coercion nudging and other method that would make massive difference straightaway thank the minister for his constructive engagement in the debate it be regrettable that time be so against we hope that progress can be make with these external representative body have an opportunity to engage with his taskforce and that he will engage constructively with colleague in the devolved institution we be come up against some of the clash between devolved and reserved responsibility the police in glasgow try to use antisocial behaviour power and other that they have in legislation govern by holyrood but we know that they would prefer to see further progress make down here in the interest of consensus and try to make that progress will leave it there in the hope that another couple of member can make their point may extend my condolence to the family of david gow congratulate the hon member for glasgow north east anne mclaughlin on secure the bill on an issue of deep concern in darlington prepare fantastic speech that be so long will not have time to get through it but will try to put some point on the record warmly welcome the engagement that have have with the minister on this topic in the past few day it be so refreshing to have have that engagement and to hear of his willingness to bring forward taskforce which might have some pilot across the country may suggest two location for his taskforce to look at one would be in glasgow and the second would be in darlington it be wonderful to be able to make policy for department for which be not responsible be clearly respond for the department for transport worthy and honourable department that be delighted to represent but so much of this issue be link to the home office hope to sit down with the policing minister who run the asb work be do presently there have be two laudable recommendation for potential pilot project in glasgow know robroyston well have spend some time there on november for the by election in which ruth davidson feature so honourably and darlington would be delighted to visit my hon friend in darlington he be just down the road from to see some of the problem at first hand and make those recommendation to the policing minister be grateful for that intervention from the minister who be the first minister to come and visit in darlington after be elect he have make repeat visit in his various role and he be always welcome as he trek up past my constituency would warmly welcome he meet darlington borough council civic enforcement team as well as the operation endurance team from darlington and durham constabulary they have be do amazing work in this area but it be not enough be conscious of the time and be not sure whether the minister will have time to wind up the debate so will waive my place in the debate and let my hon friend finish his speech do he agree that it would be great to get the minister to commit to ensure that the taskforce he be set up which be incredibly welcome will on behalf of rural community such as mine look at the blight of off road vehicle on the green lane that he mention it be good thing that many byway and bridlepath have now be protect from off road vehicle but there be mile of track in the uk many of they be in wiltshire which be devastate by quad bike and off road vehicle which be cause huge damage do he agree that it would be good if the taskforce review the legislation so that we can try to get more of those lane protect wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend represent an entirely urban constituency that face the blight of this problem appreciate and understand that there be significant issue in the countryside from the use of these vehicle there be also significant issue for our farming and rural constituency with the theft of these vehicle there be an intervention early about engagement and have recently meet the national motorcyclists council and the trail riders fellowship on this issue but put on the record and want to be absolutely clear that off road bike be mean to be use in lawful manner for off road biking trail riding and competition have no desire to stop those legal and lawful activity have no truck with the lawful use of off road bike my concern come from seek to address the concern of thousand of my resident whose life be blight by these vehicle it be as clear as day to that register vehicle will help to end the terrorising of our street and well enable police force to tackle the problem of these bike rip through their community just to bring the house up to speed follow my westminster hall debate on this issue there be discussion about whether farming community would be oppose to registration follow that debate write to the nfu have include part of the letter back from the nfu in my speech but there will not be time to cover it will happily furnish the minister with copy of that letter my hon friend will be conscious that the equipment theft prevention act which start as private member bill from my hon friend the member for buckingham greg smith address lot of those issue as someone who represent the second big constituency in england and who have many issue with byway open to all traffic particularly in slaley forest know that the practical reality be that the rural implication of this bill be just as significant albeit different be grateful to the minister for that intervention it demonstrate where town and country can bring their respective voice to this place to tackle an issue that affect all community off road bike and quad bike be great piece of equipment they be great for go scramble or get around rural farmland essentially that be their legal and intended purpose they be not design to be use on our street by people intent on cause terror and fear they be not design to be use by criminal wear balaclavas or mask to evade police detection they be not design to create noise nuisance and safety fear in our community but in darlington that be precisely what we see happen know from speak to colleague across the house that they see it too these reckless biker have no care for other and nor do they seem to care about themselves when they opt not to wear helmet but instead balaclava for no other reason than to protect their identity they sail through red light ride on pavement and display no light it be miracle that we in darlington have not see the tragedy that the hon member for glasgow north east have see have already pay tribute to the work of durham constabulary and the darlington civic enforcement team for their work on operation endurance use section order but on its own that be not enough and neither be registration nor track the vehicle we need co ordinate approach from multiple departments across government to tackle this problem will make one small political point we have see tail off in call to durham police because of the call handling time durham constabulary be oversee by labour police and crime commissioner and we have see poor service and performance from she that be why be keen for we to see on may the election of rob potts the conservative candidate to be durham police and crime commissioner he have commit to endorse operation endurance and reform those response time it be clear to that when vehicle be

time on friday june petition recommendations of the infected blood inquiry rise to present petition on behalf of everyone affect by the infected blood scandal particularly those who be my constituent in west lancashire pay particular tribute to my constituent rosemary kirk who bravely share with her story of how she lose her mother to this scandal and to my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson who have fight tirelessly for justice for those infected and affected also thank the terrence higgins trust for its work in this area and for its help and support to on this issue too little movement have be make since we vote on this matter last december the petition state the petition of resident of the constituency of west lancashire declare that people who receive infected blood and who have suffer as consequence have along with their family wait far too long for redress the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to implement the recommendation in the second interim report of the infected blood inquiry without delay and the petitioner remain etc age dispute refugee children motion make and question propose that this house do now jenkinson it be privilege to have secure this adjournment debate on age dispute refugee child should declare at the outset that be an officer of the all party parliamentary group on refugee know the minister will agree that there be few issue more important than the safety of child but the current system for deal with age dispute refugee child be let many of they down with their safety and wellbeing put at risk as result the helen bamber foundation the humans for rights network and the refugee council have obtain datum show that over an month period between january and june more than child be wrongly assess to be adult by the home office such incorrect assessment be usually the product of short visual examination make by border official almost immediately after the child arrive in the uk incorrect assessment result in child be place in adult accommodation and immigration detention expose they to significant safeguarding risk and deny they the support they need to rebuild life that have already be distort by trauma and hardship of specific concern be the case of child be send to wethersfield or end up in adult prison will return to that point in great detail later but will first explain why the current process for assess the age of asylum seeker be problematic before do so thank the refugee council for the information it have provide to in advance of this debate also sincerely thank omer motawakil and amanual three young refugee wrongly assess as adult who be kind enough to meet early this afternoon to share their experience and who be in the gallery respectfully encourage the minister to reach out to the refugee council to see whether it can facilitate similar meeting for she as find my meeting both eye opening and deeply move let turn back to the issue of flawed assessment process for child seek asylum the issue emerge from the fact that many child seek asylum arrive here without passport or birth certificate often because they have never have such documentation or because it be take from they during their journey to the uk in other case they flee such trauma that they be unable to collect any of their documentation understand that if young person arrive here without id it can be difficult to determine their age and no system for do so will be perfect but charity also tell of child arrive with id only to have it immediately set aside at the border as understand it the current model place the power to change young asylum seeker life in the hand of border official conduct an age assessment base accord to home office guidance on person appearance and demeanour if say border official believe that the asylum seeker be the age they claim to be and different border official judgment will be hugely variable they be place into the care of the local authority where further age assessment carry out by qualified social worker can take place if necessary and where support network be more readily available if however the border official believe that person appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they be significantly over that person will face an age interview at processing centre in dover it be not just refugee charity that have raise concern about this process even the home office own guidance make it clear that physical appearance be notoriously unreliable basis for assessment of chronological age and that demeanour can also be notoriously unreliable what be more the independent chief inspector of border and immigration have describe age assessment be undertake at port as perfunctory beyond the visual assessment be aware that many refugee who have be through the process have raise concern about the interview that have be undertake their experience include not be provide with the correct interpreter be call liar and face inappropriate comment about their physical appearance this be unacceptable and the reason it be so worrying be that the stake be so high when child be incorrectly assess as adult they be place into poorly supervise adult accommodation hotel and detention centre the safeguard risk for such child be obvious some be as young as share living accommodation with unrelated adult tragically there have be multiple case of these child be sexually and physically assault other child have witness suicide or self harm by the traumatise adult they be live with who be in need of help themselves even if they avoid that child in such setting still miss out on access to the pastoral and educational support that they need to rebuild their life many have report be stick in their hotel room for day on end with little or no information on how to challenge their age assessment and no certainty about their future the toll this take on their mental health and wellbeing be huge of the safeguarding referral make to the refugee council relate to potential child stay in adult accommodation the highest report risk be suicide the second high risk be that the child abscond and we lose all sight of they not know whether they have become homeless destitute or exploit by someone offer they accommodation elsewhere this be not alarmist it be happen be afraid to say that the government recent illegal migration legislation pose further risk chief among they that child will be inadvertently send to rwanda we know that last year there be numerous case of child who have be detain as adult be issue with notice of intent to remove they to rwanda on flight that ultimately never take off the government recently reject baroness lister amendment to the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill which would have ensure that child who have be wrongly assess as adult by the home office would not be remove to rwanda while that decision be still be challenge in light of that would be grateful if the minister could provide assurance that appeal right regard age assessment will be grant and implore she to ensure that people appeal their decision will not be remove until that process have take place those seem like reasonable step to avoid traumatise child wrongly be send halfway across the world as well as address this issue be sure that in her response the minister will want to talk about some of the measure the government have put in place to improve the age assessment process know that these include the recent authorisation of ray and mri scan in what be be call scientific age assessment and the establishment of national age assessment board will the minister address the concern of the refugee council that the national age assessment board will not work with people who have just arrive in the uk and therefore will not impact initial age decision can the minister refer to any evidence show that the use of ray or mris be more accurate than merton compliant age assessment carry out by qualified social worker which be favour by charity work in the refugee sector will the minister explain what happen if an asylum seeker refuse an ray or mri scan there be an important principle that medical consent should not be seek from person under duress give possible issue with the proposal put forward by the government will the minister consider request from the refugee council and other to limit the conduct of age assessment to fully qualified staff with relevant training on the safeguarding issue that mention early hope the minister will consider ensure that the home office monitor what happen to people claim to be child whom the home office have determine be adult and establish proper process so that the department can track the outcome for those who be later find to be child even if the minister choose not to pursue those suggestion hope she will acknowledge that more need to be do to improve the age assessment process for young asylum seeker will end by reiterate what these child have be through they have be drive away from their home and the place they love by violence and persecution separate from family and friend and force to undertake an often perilous journey to the uk those child should not face new risk to their safety when they get here and they should not be throw into the terrifying limbo that be the adult asylum detention system they should be greet with fairness and decency when they reach these shore be sure the minister would agree that those be fundamentally british value so look forward to hear how the government will uphold they when reform age assessment process for young asylum seeker thank the hon member for stretford and urmston andrew western for secure this debate and for the sensitive way he present these issue fairness and decency should indeed sit at the heart of our immigration and asylum system particularly when it involve child it might be helpful if set out in general term the government approach to age assessment as he observe the age of person arrive in the united kingdom would normally be establish from the document with which they travel but many who claim to be child do not have documentary evidence to support their age be sure there be no real point of disagreement between the government and the opposition that there be serious safeguard risk if individual over the age of be treat as child and place in setting with child we all know about the high profile case in bournemouth last year of an adult man who be assess as be year old and in fact be want for double murder in serbia we obviously want to avoid situation of that nature and we be aware of other example where pupil in school have raise an alarm about an obviously mature adult who have join their class purport to be child indeed in one case someone be reassess to be year old than their claim age that reduce the valuable resource and support that be available to genuine child and undermine public confidence of course the government have always be clear that there be serious equivalent safeguard risk if true child be treat as adult must point out that there be incentive for adult to claim to be under as unaccompanied child generally receive high level of support than adult in several respect that include the accommodation and support they be provide with the level of care they receive perhaps include therapeutic care the procedural and substantive treatment of their immigration claim the arrangement that be need to secure their possible removal and whether or not they can be detain in immigration detention the legislative reform that the government be bring forward aim to make those assessment more consistent reliable and robust from the outset section of the nationality and borders act make provision for the scientific method of age assessment this be new and vital tool for the assessment of age that the government need to get right the full plan for integrate scientific age assessment into the exist process will be set out very shortly we accept that there be no single assessment method scientific or otherwise that can determine an individual age in response to the hon gentleman challenge scientific method offer the opportunity for significant improvement which be something we should welcome wherever we sit in respect of this debate it should also be note that the uk be one of the few european country that do not currently employ any scientific method of age assessment the immigration age assessments regulations come into force in january this year they specify the use of ray and mri of certain body area include the wrist to aid age estimation as propose in the recommendation of the age estimation science advisory committee hope can reassure the hon gentleman by say that this be an expert committee consist of subject matter expert from range of discipline include social work dentistry and radiology and establish by the home office chief scientific adviser to provide expert advice on potential scientific method of assessment as well as ethic and good practice for their use can the minister explain why the committee have encourage the government to abandon scientific method of age assessment let gently repeat that we be not go to do that we be one of the only european country that do not employ any scientific method and we be work towards the implementation of that think give fair caveat by accept that there be no single method that will ever be truly reliable but method can be use in conjunction with other in due course shall say something about the merton test to which the hon gentleman refer in his speech in our view this be not just important but vital progress in the fair and accurate assessment of age which be relevant to exactly the kind of protection with which the hon gentleman be primarily concerned the combination of dental and skeletal image be important as it increase the accuracy of the approach the committee advocate likelihood ratio method which offer logical and consistent summary of the evidence and permit great confidence in particularly the range of age assessment of whether the claim age be possible give the scientific method specify in the regulation when an individual refuse to consent without reasonable ground to the use of those method decision maker must take that refusal as damage the age dispute person credibility this be refer to as negative inference it would not automatically preclude the individual from be consider to be child that refusal would be take into consideration alongside other evidence as part of the merton compliant age assessment process none the less it will be relevant let also clarify the current process of initial age investigation the hon gentleman be correct on the individual arrival the initial assessment be undertake by an immigration officer the threshold that must be apply be that immigration officer may treat an individual as an adult only when two member of home office staff determine that individual physical appearance and demeanour strongly suggest that he or she be significantly over the age of that be deliberately high threshold the principle of the benefit of the doubt be key when there be doubt an individual will be treat as child pende further observation and consideration by local authority that approach be confirm by the supreme court in the landmark case of bf eritrea secretary of state for the home department in when doubt remain after the initial age assessment have be undertake the local authority will conduct more in depth assessment know as the merton compliant age assessment to which the hon gentleman have already refer merton assessment be holistic social worker lead assessment that must adhere to principle that have be set out by the court in the case of on the application of london borough of merton well establish public law case as well as in subsequent case law we know however that these test be not sufficiently precise they depend entirely on oral question be put to the individual in order to strengthen they the nationality and borders act allow local authority to refer age assessment to designate official of the home office who form the national age assessment board the board which be launch in march currently consist of expert social worker and aim to increase capacity and expertise in the system until we have scientific method work alongside it as well as conduct assessment for local authority the board support they with training and good practice advice lastly through the illegal migration act the government have take step to ensure that the process be as robust as possible section of the act introduce regulation make power that would allow the secretary of state to set out the effect of decision by an individual not to consent to the use of specify scientific method for age assessment those regulation could in the future specify that person who refuse to consent without reasonable ground be to be treat as though the decision maker have decide that they be over the age of that power will not be use unless and until the home secretary determine that the science and analysis be sufficiently accurate to support provide for an automatic assumption of adulthood under section of the act judicial review will not suspend removal to avoid lengthy age dispute delay or prevent removal of those who have be assess to be adult in closing once again thank the hon gentleman for secure the debate raise what be indeed sensitive issue where accuracy really do matter whatever the dispute think that we agree on that point age assessment be critical not only to the integrity of our system but of course to the protection of genuine child we understand that it be crucial that these assessment be robust consistent and well evidence to ensure that genuine child be not incorrectly treat as adult and that adult be disincentivise from knowingly misrepresent themselves as child the minister be be incredibly generous in give way again to further the attempt at accuracy may press she on the point make about further monitoring of those whose claim of be child be reject at the border at the moment we have no datum show how many of those decision be overturn later other than that pull together by the charity refer to early who find that there be between january and june and understand that there have be some since then it would be incredibly helpful if the government be to start track and monitor that information it would improve their own datum and think take we some way towards have great certainty that they be on top of this issue if the hon gentleman would be willing to write to the immigration minister have try to think about which of the two it would apply to but will get my office to clarify that will of course relay what have happen in this debate and ask they to reply specifically with reference to the number and mis categorisation that the refugee council have draw to his attention in that period this be an important issue and as have set out one that the government approach with the seriousness and hope the sensitivity that this house would expect question put and agree to house adjourn
