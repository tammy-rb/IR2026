contractual bargain between buyer and seller base on supply and demand it actually give we cheap ticket as well as more expensive one do he really want the government to get involve there know that

consider the view of teacher in my constituency last but certainly not least my hon friend raise what know be big issue in halesowen school the government be commit to curriculum reform one of the first act of the secretary of state for education be to establish an independent review of curriculum and assessment lead by professor becky francis cbe know that the secretary of state will be regularly update the house on that it be fantastic to get everybody in will focus more on name criminal justice system capacity with permission madam deputy speaker will make statement on capacity in the criminal justice system when this government come to power we inherit prison on the brink of disaster moment from total collapse have that happen the consequence would have be apocalyptic court would have be force to cancel all trial the police would have be bar from make arrest and we would have face the total breakdown of law and order the last government know what have to be do my predecessor the former lord chancellor beg his prime minister to act but rather than have the bravery to do so the now leader of the opposition choose to call an election instead as result it fall to this government to take the necessary but difficult action while they say that to govern be to choose my predecessor leave with no choice at all on july just two week into the job announce to this house that we have be force to bring forward the release date of some prisoner serve standard determinate sentence from of time serve in prison to serve the rest on their sentence on licence in the community make no mistake the action we take prevent the immediate collapse of law and order in our country but with our prison population still rise fast there be more that we must do to address the capacity challenge our prison face and our task now be to ensure that crisis like the one we inherit can never happen again today can set out measure that will begin to address specific and acute cause of our prison capacity crisis the remand population as this house will know prisoner on remand be in our jail but have not yet be try or sentence because of the historical backlog in our crown court another element of the woeful inheritance my predecessor hand to the remand population in prison have soar today it stand at record which be nearly one in every five prisoner as some member will know remand prisoner be an especially acute problem as they be place in so call reception or category prison until they be try and sentence they can not be move elsewhere in the estate it be in our reception prison that we face the most acute capacity pressure in the country unless we address our remand population we could still see collapse of the system not because of lack of cell but because we do not have those cell in the place we need they it be therefore crucial that we bear down on the remand population magistrate court have sentence power for only up to six month imprisonment for single triable either way offence and only the crown court can hand down sentence beyond that between may and march the previous government choose to extend magistrate court sentencing power to month this enable magistrate court to retain more sentencing hearing and mean that they be hear more quickly it also free up capacity in the crown court to hear more complex case however magistrate sentence power be then reduce back to six month when have fail to address the capacity crisis in our prison the pressure on prison place become too great this government have now act to relieve that pressure so can announce that we will extend magistrate sentence power back to month imprisonment on october will lay statutory instrument to that effect which will come into force on november this year this change do not increase the maximum sentence for specific offence and nor do it change the length of sentence that defendant will serve instead it expand which court can hand down sentence of six to month imprisonment for single triable either way offence it will enable the system to make more use of magistrate who be an integral part of our court system deliver justice swiftly across the country this measure will also allow we to begin to address the remand problem in our prison but it will do more than that this government inherit record crown court backlog wait for trial have grow so long that some case be not hear for year the impact on victim of crime be profound for some justice delay be as the old saying go justice deny as victim choose to withdraw from the justice process altogether rather than face the pain of protract legal battle by extend magistrate power we will be able to make progress on address the crown court backlog and we will free the crown court to take on more of the case that only it can hear this measure be expect to free up an equivalent of sit day within the crown court each year which will add capacity on top of the additional sit day that this government fund on take office this measure will in total see slight increase in the overall prison population but by bear down on the remand population in our reception prison we will create capacity where we need it most this measure allow we to manage our prison population smartly and it mean we can both address our prison crisis and tackle the court backlog when this government come to power we inherit justice system in crisis we take immediate action to avert total breakdown of law and order we be now begin the work of ensure that this country never face this crisis again there will be more that we must do in the come week will return to the house and set out our long term plan for the justice system but these new power for magistrate mark an important step they help we alleviate the capacity pressure cause by the historical remand population that we inherit and begin to address the record crown court backlog that my predecessor hand to in so doing for victim across the country they will make justice swifter and ensure that more criminal receive the punishment that they deserve commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister be grateful to the lord chancellor and her civil servant for their typical courtesy in give early sight of her statement be also grateful to magistrate to whom pay tribute in many way they be the backbone of our justice system and like jury they root our justice system in our local community their service be hugely appreciate as be the work of the magistrates association and recognise their skill and dedication the lord chancellor highlight the backlog as context as she will know in the backlog that we inherit in the crown court be it be reduce to by but we recognise that it be lot high now the change pandemic she rightly refer to significant increase in the remand population during the pandemic support by the then opposition we opt not to mass release prisoner as other country do and not to cancel jury trial that of course lead to increase in the remand population compound by the effect of the bar strike the vast bulk of the backlog be in the crown court as the lord chancellor will know and it be right to recognise the interrelationship between magistrate court and crown court believe that the concordat on sitting day have not be formally sign by the former lord chancellor at the time of the election and therefore see with concern that in stark contrast to previous lord chancellors who increase sitting day it appear we will see reduction of sit day compare with last year would be grateful for the lord chancellor reflection on that in there be sitting day and last year this year the cap appear to be at that appear to be the government choice but would welcome clarity from the lord chancellor on that the change that the lord chancellor have set out be characterise by the chair of the criminal bar association mary prior kc in the guardian this be knee jerk reaction do without consult once again the criminal barrister or solicitor who deal every day with these case there be therefore number of question about that and the broad criminal justice system give the scope of the right hon lady statement which hope she will be able to answer have she conduct complete impact assessment for the change and will she publish that and all the modelling on it prior to the statutory instrument be lay how many people be currently on remand and will she share with the house the late most up to date figure report suggest that this measure will in the short term potentially increase pressure on prison place so will she say by what amount her modelling suggest that will be what prior consultation do she or her department undertake with the criminal bar association the bar council and the law society before make this decision what assessment have she make of the impact of the decision announce today on the backlog and on the number of short custodial sentence pass by the court give that the right hon lady explicitly refer to her prisoner early release scheme hope she will be able to answer all those question but there be also one important question that hope she will answer today by way of reassurance be any of the prisoner release in error last month still roam free or have they all be safely return to prison would be grateful for clarification on that because it be important we will find out in under two week whether in pre budget spending discussion with the chancellor the right hon lady have successfully fight for investment and in the interest of justice and victim of crime or whether she have sell out the victim and the system and concede cut to the treasury if she have succeed in secure additional investment she will have my gratitude and support if she have not we will rightly hold she to account it be almost as if the shadow lord chancellor be not in fact minister in the ministry of justice just few short month ago let remind he of few salient fact first on crown court sitting day will not accept any suggestion or allegation from he that this government have cut sit day or trial in the crown court that be entirely untrue as he know or ought to know perfectly well be sure he can check with the former lord chancellor on june the last government and the last lord chancellor determine how many day the judge could sit this year since then this government have increase the number of sit day by as there be clearly some confusion here it be important that set the record straight every year the government and the judiciary agree number of sit day and an overall budget to fund those sit day in what be know as the concordat process in june the judiciary reach an agreement with the former lord chancellor to sit day in the crown court with total budget of million it have become clear that there have be over list against that budget with more trial schedule than the funding allow for as result some case have have to be delist although far few than some recent reporting have suggest it be claim that around sitting day be be cancel and know that the shadow lord chancellor have some other number in his remark in fact as understand it the number be more like sit day although misleading report have abound one thing be clear the concordat process have not work as it should can assure the house that the first concordat process on my watch will be very different and such confusion will not occur again the shadow lord chancellor ask number of question relate to the impact assessment for the change announce today will publish all the usual impact assessment when the statutory instrument be publish as say in my opening remark we expect an initial impact on prison place but over time we expect that to come down we have little more space in prison because of the action we have take to stabilise the pressure on prison place it be sensible measure to then take the opportunity to bear down on the crown court backlog by provide the extra sit day that this change will allow while also bear down far on our remand population as the shadow lord chancellor will know the exact number be difficult to model because listing be matter for the judiciary some of those on remand will ultimately be find not guilty and some will be find guilty and sentence and the whole range of sentencing measure be available to the independent judiciary but we expect to make some progress on the remand population and crucially to be able to move people from the reception estate into the rest of the prison estate thereby help we to make sure we have the prison place where we need they can also confirm that all of the people release in error because of be incorrectly sentence be now back in custody call the chair of the justice committee as someone who spend decade shadow and scrutinise the previous government justice policy sympathise with the lord chancellor over the chaos she have inherit but the propose change to magistrate sentence power may have mixed result they should ease the backlog in the crown court but they may put additional pressure on our overcrowded prison my concern be that we do not have robust datum on the crown court backlog or on the effect of vary sentencing the government be about to embark on quick but thorough review of sentencing will they use that opportunity to get the policy and the figure line up think this be my first chance in the house to welcome my hon friend to his new position as chair of the justice committee let deal with crown court datum first in fairness to the previous government they discover this error prior to the conclusion of their term in office when come in be make aware of the issue with crown court datum order further investigation and examination of the issue it be clear that number of problem with the datum number of error and other issue need to be resolve we will make sure that it be publish when we can be sure that it be accurate and that all those error have be finally resolve clearly the situation be unacceptable be in discussion with the lady chief justice about the need for full external audit of crown court datum because think we can all agree that that datum must be accurate we clearly must do more to restore confidence in the reporting process and will update the house far in due course call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement so many of my constituent be appal by the state in which the conservatives have leave our justice system huge court backlog woefully big remand population overcrowded prison and so many victim and survivor without justice therefore welcome her determination to arrest this problem and this decline and especially the report of her correspondence with the prime minister over fully fund ministry of justice however want to address some of the liberal democrats key concern about some of the proposal that she have set out first the secretary of state recognise that there may be additional issue with prison capacity in the short term with the system burst at the seam and with we matter of week ago just man away from the prison be completely full how will she prevent our prison from collapse as result of these measure secondly on prison effectiveness put too many egg in the prison basket will ultimately fail to keep our community safe we know that of ex offender go on to reoffend within nine year of be release from the work do before arrive in this place on get kid out of crime and out of gang know that rehabilitation do holistically be critical way of reduce reoffende and victimhood how will the secretary of state double down on rehabilitation and through the gate mentoring programme to reduce offending thirdly these measure will put more pressure on magistrate court at time when many such as my own in eastbourne have close that risk force victim of crime currently hear in those court to wait even long for justice how will the secretary of state address that risk finally one of the bad justice secretaries in recent memory dominic raab try similar policy in with magistrate increase the number of people be send to prison on short sentence the scheme be drop after year and short sentence reoffending rate be at which be deplorable number how will the secretary of state avoid these measure backfire in similar way just for reference your question should be two minute no long thank the hon member for his question be very aware of the number of place in our prison estate and we have particularly difficult moment before the last bank holiday in august when we come down to few than however as result of the measure we have take on there be now some space and some capacity in our prison system it be important that we use this opportunity also to bear down on the remand population and to deal with the crown court backlog this be delicate balance exercise and it be one that will personally be keep close eye on and keep under review however think that the measure we have announce be ultimately the right one because it help we with our prison capacity challenge as result we will have the prison place where we need they in the reception prison and we can start move people out to other part of the estate which be not possible until case be hear be confident that we have the capacity in the magistrate court to deal with the additional workload again will be keep that under review the hon member be right of offender be actually reoffender this country have real problem with fail to rehabilitate offender and our record on reduce reoffende be not as strong as it should be prison have place and it be really important that people who break our law be properly punish that be necessary for the public to maintain confidence in our system and for law abide citizen to feel that there be consequence when our law be break there be no doubt in my mind that punishment and prison be important but they go hand in hand with rehabilitation do not think there be choice to be make between punishment and rehabilitation they be two side of the same coin and we have to have both this government be determined to have well track record on both punishment and rehabilitation compare with anything that have go on in the previous year let gently say that it be not the case that magistrate court send more people to prison follow the previous change the court be able to run through case fast and because the previous government have not create capacity in the prison estate the pressure on prison place become acute and the measure have to be drop back to six month the shadow lord chancellor might wish to offer further comment on that that be what happen and what expect to happen again it be fascinating and powerful to hear the plan to deal with the backlog in the court know that all our constituent will be grateful for the lord chancellor work have constituent who be the victim of an aggravate burglary that involve multiple man come to her house with machete in finally last week at snaresbrook crown court date for the trial of the gentleman accuse of this crime be set for october the lord chancellor will recognise and share the concern of my constituent as she say justice delay be justice deny what comfort can she give my constituent that such matter will be expedite as result of her work be very sorry to hear about the experience of my hon friend constituent have many such instance of unacceptable delay for hear case in my own constituency caseload hope that the measure that have announce today will begin to ease some of that pressure because make this change will free up around sitting day in the crown court this government have fund an additional beyond the concordat process agreement that be reach by the previous government in june be determined to make more progress in deal with the crown court backlog so that constituent such as my hon friend do not have to wait so many year for their case to be hear and ultimately for justice to be do may reach out across the party divide to say that warmly welcome what the justice secretary say about punishment and rehabilitation by coincidence have just write to she she will not have see the letter yet about the work of my constituent the publisher andrew duncan in co ordination with panel of expert that include psychology professor former governor of pentonville probation service specialist in reduce reoffende and central london magistrate on new concept of community detention my request be that either she or the minister she think most appropriate will agree to have meeting with my constituent few member of his team and as right of centre politician be sometimes sceptical of alternative to prison this one sound really interesting and think it would not be waste of her time thank the right hon member for the spirit in which he make his remark hope that where consensus be possible on cross party basis across this house we be able to work together because this be national problem that will require we all to come together to solve it will track down his letter and ensure that he get full response and meeting in shropshire the justice system be break under the watch of the last conservative government the remand court in shropshire magistrate court be close and transfer to kidderminster be delighted to say that under this government watch that remand court be about to reopen some court session be run empty each and every year at shropshire magistrate court my local paper the shropshire star highlight criminal trial it involve retrial that will take seven year from the original date of the offence to be dispose of which be an absolute disgrace will the lord chancellor look at way in which we can far empower district judge in the magistrate court and at the use of technology in the justice system finally it be important that the transparency around datum be fix unfortunately the last conservative government do not release the datum on time we need to understand what be really go on now and what have happen in the past my hon friend be absolutely right case be take too long to reach conclusion in our court we be make some change and be consider what further one we will need to make there be an important piece around efficiency and productivity in the court system and there have also be report by lord justice auld lord leveson and other on other way to speed up trial be hear all those option be on the table and will update the house in due course about this government approach simply reiterate my remark on the datum when it be finally publish it be important that we can be certain that it be accurate and properly capture what be go on in our crown court and that we can all have confidence in it in fairness the last government do pick up on this problem be determined that it will be resolve and that the datum will ultimately be publish thank the secretary of state for her very welcome statement there be clear commitment to the change that be necessary she will note that nearly always focus on victim so will she outline what weight be give to victim impact statement and whether there be need to determine in law how much weight be give to the impact on devastate family always think of the devastated family they be the one who be really important let reassure the hon member that we place great importance in the victim experience this government will strengthen that far and ensure that victim be not far traumatise by their experience of seek justice victim impact statement have an important role to play the victim minister my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones recently meet victim support and other group this be really important piece of work for the government and know the hon member will hold we to account on our track record be very aware of the impact of delay in the system on victim which be why we be make the change today we will make more progress to bring those delay down thank the lord chancellor and her department for their important work in tackle the backlog give that the previous government agree the funding allocation who do she feel be responsible for the number of crown court sitting day be cut have she explore the further use of artificial intelligence in small judgment to speed up the backlog reiterate my previous remark on what have happen to crown court sitting day but do not think it be helpful for to speculate on who be ultimately responsible it be clear that the concordat process have not work as it should as say the first process that conduct as lord chancellor will not have those issue an agreement be reach and it have to be stick to be sure that all those in the system be worried about the impact on victim they be the one who will be wait long as say although report have suggest that up to sit day have be cancel the number be more like and the change we have announce today will free up capacity in the crown court be very interested in the role that ai and other technology and digital solution can play in increase efficiency and productivity in the crown court system and the court system more broadly that be subject to discussion in relation to the budget and the spending review hope to update the house in due course be very concerned to hear of the miss publication of crown court backlog datum how can we hope to drive down the backlog if we do not know how big it be one of the reason why be determined to get to the bottom of what have go wrong and to ensure that all error and accuracy issue be deal with be so that we have comprehensive datum that we can rely upon we know that the crown court backlog be at historic level sadly do not think that any assurance work on the datum will suddenly bring that down suspect it be more likely to go up but it be important to establish the true scale of that backlog because this house need to know exactly what it look like so that it can hold the government to account on their effort to bring it down we can not do that unless we know its exact size sadly suspect it will remain at the historic level that we have inherit do not think it will come down by much thank the lord chancellor very much for her statement it be very clear from everything we have see over the past year and since july that the previous government completely fail to manage our prison estate do she agree with and my constituent that it be really important that we maintain space in our prison system to lock up the most dangerous offender at the same time we need to have look at community sentence will she be do that my hon friend be absolutely right there must always be space in our prison to lock up the most dangerous offender we must always place public protection above all other consideration when it come to dangerous violent offender when we have capacity crisis as acute as the one inherit we unfortunately have to also consider alternative simply because run out of space be no option at all reiterate the remark make early punishment and rehabilitation have to go together it be not choice between one or the other they be two side of the same coin and the government be determined to make progress on both my constituent will welcome the clarity that the lord chancellor have provide today with reference to her point about the long term plan for the justice system plan that we have to get right may ask she to keep in mind the need for proper robust and accessible legal aid system my hon friend be absolutely right legal aid underpin our system of justice and access to justice stabilise the situation in relation to legal aid be key priority for the government have number of prison in my constituency so be particularly concerned to read about serco failure on tag what be the secretary of state do to hold it to account thank my hon friend for his question serco performance be unacceptable we be have daily meeting with it to ensure it recover the position have make it clear that improved performance be an absolutely priority we be already impose financial penalty give its performance to date and we will not hesitate to trigger relevant contractual penalty if it do not improve thank my right hon friend for her statement and commend she and her ministerial team for the work they be do to fix the last year of tory mess in this department in her statement she talk about the withdrawal of victim from the process on that point of rape victim be drop out of their case partly because they be wait year for justice will the secretary of state explain how independent legal advocate will support victim to see their case through to trial the introduction of independent legal advocate for rape victim will we believe ensure that the right that victim already have will be enforce and in such way as to give they the confidence to continue with their case this be key priority policy for our party and for the government and will be very pleased to be able to roll it out over the come month and year it be significant change to our legal system it will be the first time that independent legal advice be give to type of victim we think that be incredibly important because rape victim lose confidence in the process and be often re traumatise by the process of seek justice the independent legal advocate will try to ensure that the scale of justice be rebalance and that victim have fair shot at have their already exist legal right enforce prison have two vital function punishment and rehabilitation reoffende have go up because after year under the conservative prison have become college of crime we need to get the basic right and we need to get the fundamental right on prison education reform will my right hon friend look at how we can improve literacy and numeracy skill in our prison estate we will of course look at improved literacy and other skill within our prison estate the problem with run prison estate as hot as the previous government do and so full to the brim be that when we be so badly overcrowded and prisoner be lock up for hour every day there be very little other work we can do to help prisoner rehabilitate deal with the capacity crisis will enable we to have well performance and well track record on rehabilitation which be crucial if we be ultimately to reduce the number of victim in future and cut crime do the secretary of state agree that fail to address the prison capacity crisis and allow the crown court backlog to grow to unprecedented level have mean that the entirety of our criminal justice system have be break make particular reference to rape and serious sexual offence case it be clear that the position have inherit from my predecessor be shocking and completely unacceptable we be simply one bad day away from total disaster in our criminal justice system that be why since we form the government we have be make the difficult choice necessary to stabilise our criminal justice system and stabilise the situation in our prison so we can restore the system to one that the public can rightly have confidence in government childcare expansion with permission will make statement on the government plan to deliver additional place in school base nursery and clarification on government action on so call top up fee for fund childcare hour will also update the house on the government response to the consultation on safeguard requirement in the early year foundation stage framework the secretary of state have promise new era of child centre government work alongside the sector to deliver meaningful long term reform of the early year system the government believe that all child deserve access to brilliant early education regardless of who they be where they come from or their parent income today mark significant step for thousand of family as we begin the first stage of the government plan to deliver new or expand school base nursery from today primary school can apply for grant of up to from million capital funding pot to make the change need for their site to accommodate nursery the new or expand nursery be set to open across england from the start of the next school year we have choose to expand school base nursery because school be at the heart of our community school base nursery cater for high proportion of child with special educational need and disability and offer high share of nursery place in the most deprive area to support our most vulnerable child and build on the exist market the funding will be available for project that be either school run or deliver on the school site by private and voluntary provider or childminder school will be ask to work with local authority to demonstrate local parental demand for place if there be primary school that be interested in this programme but be not currently ready or eligible to host new nursery place we encourage they to register an interest for the future we expect funding to be allocate to successful school in spring to support delivery of the first nursery place from september as we expand the childcare system it be crucial that early education and childcare remain fair and accessible to all parent that be why we be take action to address situation where parent be face high and additional charge on top of the funded entitlement hour those charge which may include mandatory fee for nappy lunch or additional hour should not be condition for access fund place the vast majority of provider be work hard to make sure that parent can access their entitlement but any sort of mandatory additional charging or preferential treatment towards parent who purchase optional extras be not acceptable over the next few month my department will engage with local authority provider and parent to develop and clarify guidance on this issue include on so call top up fee we will support local authority to protect parent from overcharge turn to new childcare entitlement in september work parent of child age nine month and above be able to access hour per week of government fund early education for the first time can confirm that over additional child be now access the new entitlement deliver the scheme have not be without difficulty and owe much to the collaboration between local authority provider and the work of my right hon friend the secretary of state who have make ensure the roll out priority at the same time we be help the sector to deliver the necessary place for september this final more challenging phase of the roll out will increase the fund childcare entitlement of work parent to hour per week trust matter in politic which be why want to reiterate this government commitment to honour the promise make by the last government to deliver these entitlement but the house should be in no doubt that this will be an extremely difficult task there remain significant shortage of staff and place the government spend watchdog have say that in order to deliver the roll out in some part of the country we will need to double or even triple capacity in order to provide the additional hour there be substantial gap to fill leave behind knowingly by the conservative party we must be honest with family about the fact that in some part of england while parent may receive the hour they be promise they may not get their first choice of nursery or childminder assure the house that we will continue to work tirelessly to bridge the gap in time for next september and our plan to expand primary school base nursery will help we to deliver these entitlement our priority be to provide high quality education and care for child while ensure their safety in order to give every child the good start in life today the department publish its official response to the consultation on proposal to strengthen safeguarding requirement in the statutory early year foundation stage framework these reform be set to be implement from september the change to be make to the framework be base on lesson learn from tragic past event response to our

include those on safe recruitment child absence safe eating safeguard training and paediatric first aid training there will also be new proposal on provide employment reference and support whistleblowing these change will formalise exist good practice and will ensure that all early year educator have the knowledge and support that they need to deliver safe high quality early education and childcare as many parent know childminder be key part of the early education and childcare market provide choice and flexibility we be already deliver childminder start up grant to help new childminder with the cost of register and on november we will introduce new flexibility for childminder to help they join and stay in the profession these change will create new category of childminder who can work entirely from non domestic premise the total number of people who can work together under childminder registration will increase from three to four childminder will also have more flexibility to operate for more time outside domestic premise for instance from community hall or school these new flexibility will far support the government commitment to roll out expand childcare entitlement and give child the good start in life parent need for childcare do not stop when their child reach primary school age since july we have allocate more than million to local authority to begin deliver these new place to parent of primary school age child as part of the national wraparound childcare programme initial delivery plan indicate that this programme will deliver up to new childcare place at either end of the school day available in over of all primary school however we want to go far to support hard work family and tackle disadvantage which be why we commit ourselves in our manifesto to introduce free breakfast club in every primary school breakfast club can have tremendously positive impact in help child to arrive at school on time and ready to learn while also help work parent to have more choice in the workplace from april free breakfast club will be available in up to early adopter school that will be part of the test and learn phase but new breakfast club once roll out nationally will be available to every state fund school with primary school age child and will give parent more affordable childcare choice while also help family with the cost of living child will be able to start the school day ready to learn which will give they the good start in life and in their education this government be determined to break down barrier to opportunity that must start before school with high quality early education that be both available and affordable we inherit pledge without plan so this labour government must work to deliver the change that family need we will deliver place in new nursery tackle unfair top up fee and ensure that every child can have the good start in life commend this statement to the house order should explain to new colleague that intervention be not make during statement by minister or response from shadow ministers now call the shadow minister to respond to the minister statement thank the minister for give advance sight of his statement labour members may take this opportunity to create fictitious narrative about the alleged failure of the former government on early year and childcare but it will not wash with we and it will not wash with the british public that be simply because our record on childcare be strong so let take this opportunity to remind the government and the house exactly what it be in we extend the three and four year old entitlement commonly take as hour week for week of the year in we introduce hour of free early education week for disadvantaged two year old in we double the three and four year old entitlement to hour per week for work parent as well as introduce tax free childcare which mean that for every people pay in the government would automatically add to support childcare cost on top of the free hour entitlement in march we announce the big expansion of childcare by uk government in history it be intend to give work parent access to hour of free childcare week from when their child be nine month old until they start school and to save family an average of year our reason for do that be simple childcare be one of the big cost face work family today as well as one of the big barrier to parent return to work if and when they wish to do so want to take this opportunity to thank early year provider local authority membership body and other key partner who have make deliver this possible welcome the fact that the government have finally agree that roll out our childcare expansion will empower parent to make the choice that be good for they and be commit to do so be however disappoint that they do not do more to spread awareness among parent of the childcare entitlement that become available in september will the minister tell we whether there be any unspent budget for this and will he now commit himself to increase the publicising of childcare roll out so that parent be rightly aware of their entitlement of course the opposition welcome the expansion of childcare and support the idea of utilise unused space in school which provide single point of contact for parent with multiple child but will the minister tell we how many childcare place the first new or expand nursery will provide the government previously pledge to deliver nursery to support childcare place what will be the timeline for the delivery of the rest of those nursery and be the government still commit to the creation of childcare place across the country in the long term the education secretary have confirm that early year and childcare be her no priority which wholeheartedly support however the government education tax will mean that child in class in which one child be five year old or be due to turn five by the end of the year will be subject to the government retrograde education tax regardless of their age will the minister confirm that that be indeed broken promise how can the british public trust the education secretary word that she will prioritise early year and childcare when she have already break promise within the first day of labour government thank the shadow minister for his response and welcome he to his place know that he will want to be keen champion for the early year sector and be glad to hear he welcome the update that have give to the house as say in my statement labour be committed to the delivery of expand entitlement across government the last government leave significant challenge but we be not shirk that responsibility with labour the early year sector can rest assure that we will be work tirelessly to deliver wide sea change in early education as well as high and rise standard throughout the education system let now deal with some of the hon gentleman specific point it be clear to from my consultation and engagement with parent and provider so far that we have inherit pledge without plan and the consequence of that be inherit delivery challenge relate to workforce and place appreciate the point that the hon gentleman make about the workforce believe by reset the relationship with the workforce we can have much more positive relationship with the sector in the future over child have benefit from the entitlement offer since september this year which demonstrate that we be actively engage and work with parent to promote opportunity to take up the offer we will continue to do so on school base nursery the pilot during the testing phase be for place from april our ambition be for place over the course of this report october vol correction look forward to work with the hon member constructively to bring about the change that early year education so desperately need thank the minister for all the work he be do to right much overdue wrong it be extraordinary to hear the shadow minister try to claim credit for something this government have finally do today put to rest the concern that many of we try to raise with the previous government thank the minister for be honest enough to finally publish the datum about the number of people we need work with our child to make these plan happen the previous government always avoid the question and now we can see why because the datum show that we will need an extra people work in our childcare sector by autumn next year to fulfil all our pledge and an extra by the end of this year will the minister tell we more about his workforce strategy we take our hat off to the people who look after our child know this government want to invest in they but we need lot more of they what can we do to make that happen thank my hon friend for her tireless work speak up for child young people and parent up and down the country as she rightly say we be work hard with the early year sector to recruit the staff we need include through the extended recruitment campaign do something big so that we attract more people to work in the early education system and ensure there be good training pathway into career in early education we be reset relationship with staff across the education sector to ensure they be respect and value for the important work they do school base nursery currently have low turnover and have the option to use some staff flexibly between reception and early year in primary school be look forward to crack on with deliver on those commitment call the liberal democrat spokesperson who have

investment in the future and contribute to economic performance in the present as well most importantly it be the most effective way to narrow the gap between rich and poor child broadly we welcome the government promise to expand access to affordable childcare and early year education under the previous government we see what happen when big promise on childcare be not back up by the funding and resource need to deliver they the conservative government plan risk exacerbate the problem that parent already face lack of childminder place and eye watering fee the number of childminder in england fall by an estimate between and last year report find that of nursery manager would limit the number of place they offer unless the government help with recruitment note from the minister

say that the particular highlight of the summit for be the evening reception at st paul at which his majesty the king be present and at which many of we be delighted to hear elton john who have some very warm word to say about our new government he say something like we ve be in the doldrum for the last few year but now we have new government under the leadership of new prime minister and thing be look up as the chancellor make clear in her closing speech at the summit since take power this government have put unlock private investment at the heart of everything we do our investment summit demonstrate our commitment to growth and that the uk be once again open for business call the shadow secretary of state may welcome the minister back to this place and to her new position assure she that be very happy to work with she to further the good interest of the united kingdom very much welcome what happen on monday have investor come to this country be very welcome this country be clearly open for business we be keen to help the government to succeed because it be in everybody interest speak not only as constituency mp but as former businessperson be also pleased to hear the prime minister talk about cut red tape and regulation we would all welcome that although have some question we know that there be bottleneck in our economy particularly in planning and infrastructure so we will welcome any change that the government can successfully make to accelerate the project that have be hold up by problem we also welcome the work for which understand the minister be responsible in her other role as minister for pension on the mansion house compact and the mansion house reform which could liberate billion of capital into our productive economy that be much need only or be invest today in equity compare with couple of decade ago so it be very important that we continue the reform start by the last government we be pleased to see all the positivity on monday despite the gloom and doom that we have hear from government members in recent week it be good to hear investor say that now be the right time to invest in the uk we can see why laughter no it be not necessarily because there be labour government it be because inflation be run at below whereas it be run at only two year ago in this country we have only unemployment our economy be grow as fast as any other in the and our deficit stand at that be what we hand over to the minister government the deficit be high than we would have like but in by comparison it stand at more than we constantly hear from labour member the refrain that they inherit the bad economic situation in history but that be simply not the case be happy to take an intervention from the minister or any other government member on that point if they can name single metric that be bad today than in will be happy to hear it rise the chair of the business and trade committee be go to give we one the hon gentleman give way with characteristic generosity the truth be that the international monetary fund forecast growth for this year at about that family be about bad off on average at the last election than in and that since the national debt have more than double to trillion suggest that those three metric represent not good inheritance but bad one there be no doubt that we have be through difficult time give the effect of covid and the cost of live crisis on service economy but the right hon gentleman will acknowledge that back in the deficit be more than whereas today it be only in real term adjust for inflation that be difference of about billion the equivalent of the health budget the inheritance leave for the present government be much well than the one we receive in the shadow secretary of state be be generous to point suggest kindly that in the outgoing labour government do not leave billion in year hole in the public finance as the conservative government bequeath to we the minister be very sensible person with experience both in the private sector and in politic so be surprised that she mention that figure of the billion billion be result of her government action in lift public sector pay without any commensurate productivity improvement and in scrap the rwanda scheme it be fake news to say that there be billion black hole be afraid and the minister absolutely know it there be no doubt that there be tough spending decision and tough choice to be make but it be very disappointing that one of the government tough choice have be to scrap the winter fuel allowance let we see what their other choice will be do the shadow secretary of state acknowledge that the cost of government borrowing that this government have inherit be roughly double what it be in that is in part direct result of the disastrous liz truss mini budget that be simply not true just read what the bank of england say about that time all the number go back to normal within month of that fiscal event the hon gentleman can choose his opinion but he can not choose his fact let we look at some fact of course we welcome the billion that have be announce but as the minister and her government stand on platform of honesty and transparency let we put some honesty and transparency around the number the amazon billion be announce on march this year the blackstone investment of billion in data centre be announce on april this year of the billion announce billion be announce prior to the investment summit or initiate via thing like auction by the previous government only of what be announce be not already in the pipeline before the investment summit the reality be that much of it be already bake in there be bind to be an overlap when new government come in but let we have some transparency and honesty around the number by spring this year financial market have already price in the fact that they expect large labour victory and that be what give business and the market so much confidence in the future stability of our economy will the shadow secretary of state explain why will come on to confidence in second if may the reality be that the uk have always be good place for foreign investor for the past three year it have be no in the world for foreign direct investment the only country ahead of we have be the us and china the minister refer to the wonderful event at the guildhall we have wonderful place to host international event and we support what they do to show the good of britain to our international investor be pleased but perhaps surprised to see elton john entertain the audience be expect taylor swift be that ever on the agenda there be obviously very strong relationship there but when think about it and when hear about the reversal of position on the dp world investment think well it obvious why they ve do that they ve ask elton and the transport secretary to join in duet of sorry seem to be the hard word interestingly press release on this mention rogue operator be not sure whether that mean the secretary of state or the company so be not sure where that all land in the end or whether that be just rogue comment by the secretary of state none the less we welcome the investment and we will absolutely support any success that the government can achieve but as the opposition it be right that we challenge where challenge be due we have many concern about some of the thing to which the minister refer she be absolutely right to say that stability be the key it breed confidence in investor which breed investment that be why we be particularly concerned about the change to business taxation some be float month ago and have be leave hang in the air we know that this be now affect investment particularly around capital gain tax and around business relief it use to be call business property relief which be very close to my heart business relief give private business and business list on aim the ability to pass on their asset to the next generation without inheritance tax there be number of question around whether that relief will be continue it be hugely important that the government do continue it because it affect some of this country fantastic family business which generate around billion of tax receipt every single year and employ nearly million people that business relief be there for reason it be not tax loophole it be an incentive for family and intergenerational business to pass on their asset from one generation to the next similarly that happen with agricultural property relief we be also concerned about the government unwillingness to confirm that there will be no rise in national insurance for employer member on both side of the house have describe that as job tax and that be exactly what it be all the uncertainty around business taxation will mean suspension of investment and reduction in the amount of hiring particularly when it be see in conjunction with the potential workplace change that the government be make which we will debate in the house on monday and about which we have great concern in particular those relate to union power could take this country back to the know that many member in this place will not remember the but do and it be not good place to be in the prime minister statement he talk about cut red tape if as currently draft the new regulation particularly those for small and medium sized enterprise be add to the employment rights bill it would seriously damage growth investment and sme but the minister do not need to take my word for that let read out some of the comment about the change that the government be think of make that will damage investment the federation of small businesses say that its member be view the measure come down the line with trepidation tina mckenzie describe they as clumsy chaotic and poorly plan she say there be already few payroll job since labour take power and the new government be send out troubling signal to business and investor those be her word not mine the institute of directors say that confidence be fizzle out its index in relation to investor appetite have go from plus in june to minus in october that be in just four month the cbi say that of employer say that the uk will be less attractive place in which to invest ernst young say that of asset management private equity client have ask they to start work on move abroad do the hon member agree that he be now guilty of talk down the entrepreneurial spirit and the ability of uk company to cope with an exciting new government be very keen not to do that that be my point it be gloom and doom from the opposition sorry mean the government have to stop do that and it be bring on by these significant change these be not my comment but the comment of sensible business representative organisation which be represent their member we should listen to the voice of business in this context even richard walker of iceland food one of the government supporter say that the change must happen slowly to avoid disastrous impact realise that we have lot to get use to these day have to get use to call those on the labour benches the government and also have to get use to be backseat driver it be even more frustrating be backseat driver when the learner driver in the drive seat do not know the difference between the brake and the accelerator importantly stability be one of the key lever that the government have at their disposal winston churchill once say that some people see private enterprise as predatory tiger to be shoot some see it as cow that they can milk few people see it for what it really be the strong horse that pull the whole cart it be hugely important that we get behind private enterprise in this country it be hugely important that we get that stability in tax policy workplace policy and the employment relationship it be hugely important that we continue to level up this country note that levelling up seem to have disappear as departmental aim but that be still hugely important to all part of this country not least to the part of the country that represent it be also hugely important that we control energy cost we know that that be key concern to many business around the uk another key concern be that we cut the red tape for our large company the area that focus most on as business minister be sme which be the backbone of our economy the no area that they struggle with be access to finance would really like to see some different measure in that area on that point about finance be pleased to see that jp morgan which have its headquarters in my constituency join other big bank in the world to back the push to invest in the uk ahead of the summit do the hon member agree with jp morgan and those bank that we should be optimistic about the future of the british economy follow the election would not necessarily say follow the election but generally we should be very positive about our economy set out early some of the economic condition that would make it conducive to invest in the uk and we should be proud of that situation welcome the minister comment about the change of priority of the british business bank specifically in relation to the pathfinder initiative that piece of work be start by my hon friend the member for grantham and bourne gareth davies when he be in the treasury again that will help to ease the flow of finance into our sme as look with mixture of sadness and joy at the now redundant conservative party manifesto can see that there be some really positive idea in there about ease finance for sme in particular be refer to thing such as regional mutual bank which be policy that the labour government should adopt and the open finance and smart datum revolution for our economy which could transform the opportunity of sme finance make it much easy for sme to shop around however the key thing that would reiterate to the minister and her team be that they need to make sure that we have stability in term of not just work but business taxation capital gain tax and business relief say no to job tax but yes to stability and business taxis say no to take we back to the by give union more power no to doom and gloom and yes to positive and optimistic view of the uk future in the world call jade botterill to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to deliver my maiden speech in this important debate on international investment the benefit of which will be feel right across all region of our country

support as well as my brother who have always be there for during some of the most challenging time be delighted that they have travel from wakefield to be in the public gallery today their own commitment to our community in their long career of public service work hard and talk straight be principle that hope to emulate here my mum be so committed to the north that this be her first ever trip to london proof be it ever need that us northerner only come south if somebody make we know many member have already speak about the beauty of their patch but with respect must make the case for ossett and denby dale drive from ossett towards the wakefield rural village and into denby dale the sky widen and the moor roll out before you on that drive when see the emley moor mast appear from the horizon build tall than the eiffel tower know be home it be beautiful it be yorkshire and it be the place that make who be today it be not just those moor and view that move it be also the people who call they home we be people of talent community and as good yorkshire folk say hard graft in fact that beautiful landscape be the fruit of exactly that graft of that talent you see it in the pit dig across the countryside that serve to fuel and heat our nation you see it in the field plough plant and graze by countless generation to feed not just yorkshire but the rest of the country you see it in the town market which have bustle with small trader craftsman and local farmer for generation that landscape be not just the cradle of talent but product of it each town each village have its own community its own culture all quietly proudly distinct as well as hard work these town and village be famous for their culture their creativity and their heritage home to brass band morris dancer maypole and even doctor who but most importantly of all the world great rugby league team wakefield trinity labour may be party of the union but in west yorkshire when it come to rugby we watch the proper stuff and as you will know madam deputy speaker that be league we be also home to yorkshire sculpture park with its barbara hepworths and henry moores and the national coal mining museum which root we in our proud history be enthusiastic sometimes maybe little too enthusiastic that my constituency contain so many wonderful pub and brewer we have the ever expand ossett brewery and our famous yearly festival ossett beercart just as we work hard and play hard we also pie hard indeed for over year the people of denby dale have mark special occasion in the only way think appropriate by bake enormous pie to feed thousand some even as long as foot with nine tonne of filling and pint of bitter that history and that culture must be champion it be yorkshire culture it be our culture but refuse to talk about my community only in the past tense about opportunity we use to have and industry we use to lead indeed want my successor in this place to be celebrate the creativity and achievement of child be bear in my constituency today sadly however the social mobility commission recently report that many young people in ossett and denby dale and other post industrial community across our nation face an uphill battle grow up in rural town know that feel all too well that the place you be from be overlook forget even that opportunity be few and far between and that the only path to success in life be leave your family your friend your home after briefly live in london in my twenty for work remember feel like the token northerner with the funny accent find myself have to speak eloquently so folk down here could actually understand the only problem with that be that when get back home my friend and family would ask why be speak so posh it actually make feel quite lose young people in ossett and denby dale and in town and village across our country should not feel like they have to get out to get ahead and yet so many of they do to talk solely about what be once possible in our community be to betray those young people instead our politic must be build on their dream and on their potential decent secure job with reliable public transport to get they there good affordable housing where they can build their family and their future high quality education and skill training access to creativity and culture aspiration hope when they see the sky widen and the moor roll out before they with emley moor mast stand tall on the horizon young people should see somewhere that be ready to be remade once more by their talent by their graft by they england be nation of town and village like mine of community of culture of graft for england to succeed town and village must succeed and it will be my mission in this place to see that happen welcome the minister to her place also thank she for her support when she be not in this place and be far back on these benches and we work together on some of the issue under focus today we liberal democrats want britain to be one of the most attractive place in the world for business to invest we want to see responsible sustainable business invest in tackle the climate emergency and create job growth and wealth some of which should be invest into our health education and public service welcome the government decide to hold an international investment summit within their first day it send an excellent signal to the world that uk plc be open for business and we liberal democrats welcome and support that move we welcome too the announcement about the revival of the industrial strategy and new strategy for the british business bank we look forward to scrutinise those plan as constructive opposition however we also know that this government have to rebuild not only the economy but our country reputation it be an enormous relief that some of the dark day of the last government be hope behind we we have the tweet diplomacy of two former prime ministers which make we look like small country on the international stage we have the half bake brexit deal which have wrap up small business in red tape and ream of paperwork we have the rolling back on net zero and the flip flop fiasco on which create uncertainty scar off investor and put the job of the future at risk we also have the sheer incompetence of government who have forget how to negotiate in my former role as my party health spokesperson talk to some of the pharmaceutical company involve in the voluntary scheme for brand medicine pricing and access negotiation it become patently clear that many be put their investment abroad and not in this country that investment be lose on the conservatives watch even though welcome many of the thing that the labour government have propose and be bring forward there be some notable gap and it be on those gap that wish to focus we know today debate be about international investment but urge the government to think about local investment in this country too small business be the engine of growth and the backbone of our economy they be the heartbeat of our community but they be really struggle to invest there be one major reason for that the broken business rate system it be absolutely absurd that small brick and mortar business on our high street up and down the country see their business rate go up while amazon warehouse see their business rate go down it be disgrace urge the labour government in the strong possible term to make the budget this autumn the final one in which business rate be permanent feature they should be scrap and replace with commercial landowner levy urge the labour government to act on that as soon as possible to make it even bad we know that in many part of the country where high street be not in good state there be small business that want to invest in good environmental thing they want to invest in solar panel insulation ventilation and bike shed thing that would be good for business and create sense of community tackle the climate emergency and improve the public realm yet if they invest in those thing their business rate can go up that be absolutely nuts and urge all colleague to get behind my call to make the upcoming budget the final one in which business rate be permanent feature the other point will talk about be skill the government have talk lot about invest in infrastructure housing and big thing that we can build but skill be so important in my constituency we have phenomenal organisation call gem cable solutions lead defence and aerospace company that make bespoke cable and fibre optic use precision manufacturing that mean individual people make handmade cable that be fly thing into space it be extraordinary but can the company get the highly qualified engineer that it need in this country no it often can not because we be compete on the international stage for some of the fine engineering talent at the same time under the last government the company could not get that talent from abroad either so urge the new government to bring forward skill strategy as soon as possible consult with other party and ensure that our small business can get those skill my third point be about the climate job of the future know the uk infrastructure bank have be rebrande the national wealth fund and have attract billion in fund already would be grateful if the minister could confirm whether the new wealth fund will have an explicit remit to support the uk transition to net zero carbon emission finally it be no secret that brexit have wrap up our small business in red tape and that they be deal with ream of paperwork we have to remove as many trade barrier to our small business as possible urge the government to bring something forward on that front as soon as possible call sarah russell to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for allow to make my maiden speech when drive around my congleton constituency thank my lucky star that have the privilege of both live in and represent somewhere so very beautiful it be make up of gorgeous rolling countryside farmland hedgerow and oak tree the farmer work all hour to produce the food that we need it have

the lovell arboretum overlook st peter the archetypal village church though each town and village have its own unique character and history the joy and challenge experience by the family who live there be often remarkably similar they include family whose child have special educational need and disability who often face extensive challenge get the diagnosis and support that they need those family need our help and will do everything that can to assist they have be pleased to hear the prime minister refer repeatedly in this chamber to those difficulty and be confident that he will help we too family will also benefit from labour review of share parental leave some woman year lose their job when they be pregnant or on maternity leave woman actually out earn man in their the gender pay gap be in many respect actually motherhood penalty man take long period of paternity leave be way that we could normalise parental leave and potentially reduce those problem thank the government for start the consultation on this matter imminently pay tribute to campaign group such as pregnant then screwed rights of women the dad shift parent out loud and the tuc and trade union which be all do incredible thing in this field many homeowner in my constituency have be affect by leasehold and fleecehold problem and will welcome our plan reform on these issue to which intend to contribute they include old people often the backbone of our community who provide childcare for grandchild and often volunteer as well sometimes however they do so in avoidable pain while on nhs waiting list that be too long those be just few of the issue that intend to apply myself to as mp for congleton let take the house back to congleton history congleton be know as beartown owe to local story that in the the town save up to buy new bible shortly before the summer fête the village bear die so the townsfolk agree that rather than buy their bible they would postpone the purchase and get new bear with the money instead congleton be very entrepreneurial across the whole constituency and many of our small business feature reference to the bear it be also in our local iconography everywhere we have the beartown tap and beartown beer the bear feature pretty much everywhere as do our fantastic statue of elizabeth wolstenholme elmy which be lobby and fundraise for by local feminist elizabeth who base herself in congleton from until her death in play significant role in the woman suffrage movement found the women social and political union and campaign for woman education and voting right hope

provide much need food support within the community they do this for far large number of adult and child than the apparent affluence of the area would superficially lead one to expect as

local community since then more pride event have grow in sandbach alsager and for the first time this summer holmes chapel at one of these event it be suggest to that these be really just family fun day village fête if you will it be true that the event be fun fabulous and family friendly but beyond the live music and bright clothing there remain serious message the hard work volunteer who make these pride event happen do so in the face of repeat homophobic hate crime similarly there be still backdrop of fear attendant in many woman daily life woman in my constituency have write or speak to about their experience of sexual violence say to the young woman who have talk to you know who you be that will fight for you and all young people in this place every day that will include ensure that when embrace new technology and innovation as we have do this week at the international investment summit we find way of protect people from new threat whether that be people look at tractor on their smartphone in this workplace or artificial intelligence bake in discriminatory decision making unfortunately new technology also bring the potential for harassment discrimination and abuse and we must not be catch off guard we must get on the front foot on that my constituency have long history of develop new technology the constituency boundary bisect the site of jodrell bank the amazing radio telescope sandbach be the proud home of erf and foden truck the first foden traction engine be build in sandbach in and that be follow by the production of heavy good vehicle for year the history and heritage of foden still run through the blood of the town with the annual transport festival and its incredible parade of vintage truck wagon classic car and even the odd plane on the common my constituency be also home to one of the world lead brass band foden band which be bear out of the work in and have twice win and twice be runner up in the national brass band championship of great britain will work across this house to stand up for the incredible entrepreneurial and community minded people and business of the beautiful place that be the congleton constituency lastly want to say some thank yous thank the volunteer who help to get here and continue to support to whom be very grateful that include those from the labour party and make special mention of the fabian women network mentoring scheme thank my adore family who be in the public gallery today when be in westminster miss you so much hope do all of you proud pay tribute to those who have make their maiden speech today think we all feel the passion and emotion in the beautiful speech by the hon member for congleton mrs russell she have give an idea when be out in keston this weekend might recommend to the resident that we get ourselves village bear although can hear my daughter recommend that we get ourselves village harry styles that would probably be prefer the hon member for ossett and denby dale jade botterill speak passionately about represent the place that she call home the idea of pie hard be what be look forward to bruce willis remake in the roll hill of yorkshire would be most enjoyable congratulate both member on their maiden speech will continue be nice to the opposition the government yes the government have pick up that habit from my hon friend and do apologise be impress by what have be achieve at the international investment summit within week of allegedly receive the bad economic inheritance of any incoming government since the second world war labour have supposedly secure billion of pound of investment that be frankly unbelievable and not because doubt our country ability to attract investment britain be tremendous place to invest as wealthy free fair and talented nation where people can do business and thrive that be why britain foreign direct investment stock grow to more than trillion throughout successive conservative government more than france germany and italy combine my scepticism be about the idea that the government who appoint minister for investment only four day before the summit secure every penny of the investment as anyone in business will tell we the devil be in the detail and quick inspection will confirm that most of the investment be in progress thank to the last conservative government let we look at clean energy for example britain secure much of the investment that the government claim credit for thank to conservative policy contract for difference without that market mechanism under which investor bid for guarantee price we would not have secure as much investment as cheaply for bill payer it be why we have the world four large offshore wind farm off our coast why renewable generate of our electricity today compare with in and why the uk be able to close its last coal fire power plant this year that be conservative record as much as labour might envy it the government have do the easy bit in tally the figure and take credit for someone else work admittedly that be hard task when no be in such disarray and the minister have only two day to prepare for the summit in fairness only time will tell if the summit be success and the relationship build there lead to more investment beyond what be already on its way but that be the hard bit because to secure more investment and compete globally britain need to be light on regulation and low in taxis although the prime minister talk about remove needless regulation and be open for business his government action say otherwise despite labour explicit manifesto pledge not to increase national insurance the chancellor be draw up plan to hike the tax for employer make no mistake that would be tax on job and would make it more expensive for firm to hire which would impact on business big and small include in my constituency from bombardier in biggin hill to pub and cafés in hayes and the churchill theatre in bromley the tax hike may fall on employer but work people will pay the price as job opportunity shrink and pay rise be limited the hand of business will be tie far by what the government themselves brand the big increase in employment regulation in generation while the government plan to tax job and pass french style union law cabinet minister take more explicit anti business approach the transport secretary admit that she have be boycott ferry company for two and half year and encourage other to do the same while the prime minister glad handed investor promise less red tape and openness to business and be careful to mention tax only once his government be deliver exactly the opposite britain face more significant problem keep up as technology advance lead on artificial intelligence quantum engineering biology or semiconductor be vital to our future prosperity and security but we face considerable challenge in do so for example britain be home to the large number of foundational model and generative al start up in europe but we lack the compute power that we need to build and run al model the previous conservative government recognise that problem and plan to build new supercomputer in edinburgh time more powerful than our current top end system but labour have now cancel that million investment that be yet another example of labour action not match its rhetoric the government can not be in favour of growth while cancel investment they can not cut regulation while plan huge increase in red tape for employment they can not support job while prepare to tax their creation and they can not claim to have the bad economic inheritance while copy and champion the work of their conservative predecessor if the government do not get their story straight investor will almost certainly stay away call callum anderson to make his maiden speech it be with deep humility that rise for the first time in this house as the member of parliament for the new buckingham and bletchley constituency and be pleased to contribute to this debate congratulate my hon friend the members for ossett and denby dale jade botterill and for congleton mrs russell on their excellent speech their constituent be

and will do my utmost to meet their standard although buckingham and bletchley be new constituency for this parliament it be in fact reunion of old friend for nearly century those community be connect as one but in milton keynes along with bletchley have the temerity to split away and flourish into the formidable modern city that it be today although the town of buckingham bletchley and winslow be different in character all have deep root rich history and between those town lie many village breathe life into the heart of our constituency be it westbury quainton stewkley or nash could go on all

particular that have chip away at the dignity of my community that be why come here with the twin ambition of great prosperity and deep bond of dignity in the vale of glamorgan and across the uk do so

site iberdrola announce it be double its investment in the uk through scottish power from billion to billion over the next four year as former trade commissioner thank my former colleague in the department for business and trade and in market such as india for the incredible work they will have be do to achieve that investment well remember the beaver away and constant phone call to major investor at such moment have be at the last summit be sure my invite to this one be lose in the post know from my time in india that international investor be already begin to price in the benefit of change in government they see labour government as source of stability and predictability and the uk become place for long term safe investment that be the stability dividend that my hon friend the minister have already speak about just say that the billion while record sum be not enough for scotland we have see significant investment in the first day but we would like to see even more come north of the border and in particular to community such as mine in ayrshire my hon friend the members for ayr carrick and cumnock elaine stewart for kilmarnock and loudoun lillian jones and for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell be keen that increase investment in ayrshire be at the forefront of ministers mind for the first time in year we have four ayrshire labour mp commit to growth and investment and labour government who can deliver it my hon friend and be work with the three local authority chief executive and the excellent principal of ayrshire college to develop that invest in ayrshire proposition and we be look at the opportunity for our region and our skill gap because year of the tories and of the snp have let community in ayrshire down our town be promise funding by the last conservative government and we like other community promise that town funding be lobby the minister for democracy and local growth my hon friend the member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris we want the town of irvine and kilmarnock prioritise but we know that other hon friend will be make similar case we need to see mix of public and private investment in our town to deliver the change that our community need my right hon friend the secretary of state for scotland be also work closely with we so that we can ensure that the ayrshire growth deal meet the real current and future need of the ayrshire economy in the thousand of conversation have during the election campaign it be clear to that job investment and growth will be the most significant change this labour government can bring to community across ayrshire my right hon friend the secretary of state for business and trade visit prestwick airport during the election campaign for which be grateful and he will remember that prestwick be scotland aerospace hub with of scotland aerospace sector job that sector already attract international investment but we want to do much much more similarly we be look at gb energy and this government to drive further green investment in ayrshire we want to see part of that green energy supply chain come to ayrshire we have positive story to tell about transform our coalfield into clean power field and we be proud to host our fair share of wind farm which play significant role in ensure the government meet their commitment to double onshore wind energy by we have also see investment in company such as xlcc subsea cable manufacturer which have secure million from the uk infrastructure bank to invest in the development of new subsea cable factory in the scottish town of hunterston which be once home to nuclear power in ayrshire that industry be now on the way out because of the fail policy of the snp which include nuclear free scotland rely on english nuclear note that once again snp members be not in the chamber in an important debate for scotland economy when torness in scotland stop generate and if no replacement capacity be build the power generate in england when there be low wind output as on monday this week for example will be need to maintain supply in scotland and it will be significantly base on nuclear energy be pleased that the last labour leadership of north ayrshire council welcome the opportunity to restart the conversation with the nuclear industry in ayrshire because the job and investment that the industry could bring would be significant with ardagh glass irvine continue to be major centre for glass manufacturing another industry that benefit from stability and predictability in policymake and that be look to make significant investment in the green transition to conclude hope my right hon friend the secretary of state see that there be significant opportunity for great investment in ayrshire and will ask her brilliant colleague in the office for investment to prioritise work with my colleague and to make that investment happen start by note that we have on the government front bench two ministers who split their time between departments one be at the treasury and the department for work and pensions and the other be at the department for energy security and net zero and the department for business and trade that just go to show that we have join up mission lead government who be try to move away from work in silos and to have shared ambition and that be to be commend we be here today to talk about investment which be obviously about money but it be also would not want to lose this about people it be about skill expertise experience opportunity for learning well job dignity at work feed family and enable the maximum amount of prosperity we should hold on to those thing because they be what our constituent want and what they send we to this place to deliver that say investment be also about the money the billion truly be record break amount and commend our mission lead government for secure it it be the clear sign that global business be back the british economy and work people under this new labour government that money could have go elsewhere but it be come to our country for all the reason just describe it be come here because the country vote for change to achieve stability in the last year we have have little to no growth with billion of pound of taxpayer money waste and huge black hole in our finance the country be leave vulnerable to the bad cost of live crisis in generation and our government be force to spend billion on household support because we be so expose to fossil fuel that be why be particularly pleased that so much of this investment be go towards clean energy for example some of the billion from octopus energy will be use to build four new solar farm across bristol wiltshire essex and the east riding of yorkshire power up to home those investment will improve our local economy and community feel sad and wrong say this but we have be talk about elton john and nobody else have make the inevitable point sorry seem to be the hard word but we be not hear it say either in jest or in sincerity as look at the opposition benches which be desert wish that conservative could speak up on behalf of british do apologise to the hon member for grantham and bourne gareth davies perhaps he will find the hymn sheet to sing from the one about be in favour of british business and investment perhaps he will also say sorry much as it be the hard word have say that twice now as say neither this debate nor these investment be just about the money hopefully nearly people across the uk include in my home of bournemouth east will begin new job as part of the green transition that our country so desperately need and that our industrial sector have be cry out for to that end very much welcome the publishing of the government green paper on their year industrial strategy which we have already hear about in the short time have be member of parliament the government have commit to strengthen britain industrial base in both the service and manufacturing industry to create good well pay job in not only the green sector we have today but those of the future with the right policy the government can supercharge investment in clean energy industry across the uk from the industrial heartland of the north to the thriving finance sector in bournemouth this be about more than just create green job it be about the revitalisation of entire region and ensure that every corner of our country benefit have be fortunate this week to spend time with investor business and work people at three event in london and the relief be palpable have listen to investor talk about how they have be hold on to money because they have be crave regulatory certainty planning reform the building of home for their worker an nhs that can fix those worker who they need at their workplace but who be at home unwell because of mental ill health musculoskeletal problem or bad and the certainty from government that would remove the barrier to growth so that the investment they make extract dividend for not just their company but our wide economy when member hear that the investment we be talk about be line up before the general election they should not believe it it come forward after the general election because business now have government who be commit to put in place the infrastructure and change need for our economy to grow now and into the future we know the benefit of action and we know the cost of inaction because we be bear those cost now work together government investor work people our trade union and business will achieve energy independence and security we will achieve fall and low bill we will achieve good job and pride in our community together with our mission lead government we will achieve grow and improve economy and way of life now call the shadow minister gareth davies thank all those who have speak in today debate it be right that recognise the contribution that have be make from both side of the house but especially those make by member make their maiden speech we all remember the moment lead up to and during our maiden speech and it still give chill to this day let say to the hon member for ossett and denby dale jade botterill that hope her mother be enjoy see the bright light of london for the first time know she will be very proud of her daughter wish the hon member for congleton mrs russell well with she campaign on parental leave we all regret the time we spend away from our family but it be for life of purpose and worthwhile cause as hard as it be have the pleasure of meet the hon member for buckingham and bletchley callum anderson before he be member of parliament hope that as the member of parliament represent bletchley he can crack the code to the success of this place the hon member for banbury sean woodcock give an excellent speech and he will be great local champion for banbury appreciate the comment he make about my former colleague and his predecessor the hon member for bangor aberconwy claire hughes will no doubt be busy in this job but hope she will still find time for frog search finally the hon member for vale of glamorgan kanishka narayan give an incredibly impressive and excellent speech he go to one of our fine school study philosophy politic and economic at oxford and later attend stanford university in california which by the way have some quite impressive alumnus be sure he have bright future in this place although he should be prepare for many of his labour colleague to constantly suggest that he be desperate to return to california at the early opportunity all jest aside let say genuinely from the outset that it be right that we welcome this government building on the strong foundation for international investment in our country as of july randomly pick month the uk be europe leader for new foreign direct investment project for third successive year with the high total number of project in the past five year the most recent official figure show that the uk rank second only to the united states for greenfield fdi overall while lead the world in investment into our renewable sector that be one of the reason why we have achieve the fast decarbonisation of any developed country in the world and we should be proud of that that be down not just to those who be elect but to official who work day in day out to support government those in the office for investment the treasury the department for business and trade and the foreign commonwealth and development office and our many trade commissioner who help drive our effort to attract significant pool of investment capital from across the world this have be good week for investment into our it really have it be important that we recognise the cross party heritage of this week summit which be sure the minister will acknowledge when she stand up labour have carry forward good idea that we conservative either implement or start in government the government deserve credit and be very happy to give it because this be in the end fine follow up to the global investment summit pioneer this time last year our cross party collaboration do not end there in many case this labour government have announce or re announce investment that be negotiate or even agree by their conservative predecessor guess some thing sound so good that they be worth repeat as my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake who have make timely entrance to this chamber to rapturous applause highlight more than half the investment that the government announce be actually announce before the general election that include the billion commit by blackstone which be announce in april and the billion commit by amazon which be negotiate by my right hon friend the shadow chancellor could mention bw group which be announce in or cyrusone which be announce in whatever the origin more private investment clearly benefit the british people contribute to more job well productivity and strong growth we can all agree on that point and it should not be take for grant commend the speech by my hon friend the member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune relatively new member who highlight the importance of not be complacent about that and in particular ensure that regulation remain low as say at the beginning commend member for all the contribution to this debate maiden or otherwise that rightly recognise the importance of private investment in our economy however we need to face the fact that this summit have be overshadow by rather large elephant in the room as the transport secretary know all too well many investment decision be provisional and dependent on an economic environment that welcome and support investment since labour have take office thank to all the doom and gloom make up black hole and submission to the union business and consumer confidence have fall and the cost of borrow for the british government have rise we have have day of self contradiction and uncertainty even in just few month this labour government have promise public investment while cut capital expenditure fret over suppose black hole while fritter away billion on pet project and union paymaster disavowed red tape while smother small business in new regulation and pay lip service to fiscal responsibility while lay the ground to fiddle the financial rule meanwhile almost every single revenue raise policy in the labour manifesto have prove pretty much worthless just like its promise not to raise national insurance the rest of we be leave wonder and continue to wonder if make successful investment how much of the return will be able to keep if take on new employee how much tax will need to pay for the privilege if increase my worker pay what will the total cost be if save for the future will the government help themselves if pass on the business build all my life to the next generation will they be penalise if billion be jeopardise by bad labour commentary billion can be jeopardise by bad labour policy investment and economic growth be not simply convene they take concerted effort not contort fiscal signal some have question whether have the summit before the budget be put the cart before the horse but my worry be that come budget day the horse will already have bolt wonder in the event that the budget backfire will the prime minister be force to disown or defenestrate yet another member of his top team to avoid take responsibility himself sacrifice someone else on the altar of self service as have be say before labour chaos might be in my party interest but it be not in the national interest want to see the promise of these investment fulfil labour must not put they at risk let we build on the success of our country economy and push up business that want to succeed not pull they down when they do succeed be afraid that as long as this chaos scandal and uncertainty continue will not hold my breath the hon member for grantham and bourne gareth davies be do so well laughter he be do so well in the first half of his comment and then he return to the same old tired line that get the conservatives defeat in the general election be so pleased to be close this debate today which in parliamentary context draw to close hugely positive and successful week for the united kingdom thank all hon member who contribute to the debate be disappointed that only one conservative mp manage to make it here to speak in the chamber and that nobody from the snp manage to come be surprised that they be not here to welcome the week we have have so far the prime minister make this government guide mission clear from day one we will go for growth at every opportunity and we be do that in spade week ago today we launch our landmark employment rights bill to create more secure employment and happy and more productive workforce on monday we launch our industrial strategy green paper something business have be cry out for which lay strong foundation for year of growth and investment in our most important sector also on monday the prime minister host some of the world big investor to show they why under this growth drive government uk plc will be blue chip company that they should invest in as be mention elton john be there to speak should tell the house that he take no fee he take no fee he want to come and celebrate with we the commitment of company from across the world come to the uk before talk bit more about the investment summit want to pay tribute to the members who speak today in particular those who make their maiden speech as someone who well up quite often and quite easily this be difficult debate for there be many moment when we look up at the gallery and see parent and other family

government my hon friend the member for congleton mrs russell give we wonderful tale of her constituency and its people include slightly odd story have say about beartown laughter but there we go that

technical age we be in today and talk about the advanced manufacturing in his constituency my hon friend the member for banbury sean woodcock be labour student do not know how many member of the

transformational investment we have prove our credential as pro business government thank to the chancellor announcement that the uk infrastructure bank would be turn into the national wealth fund we be catalyse ten of billion of pound of private investment into the uk clean energy and growth industry include green hydrogen carbon capture and gigafactorie we be establish an industrial strategy advisory council lead by clare barclay to help deliver the pro business environment on which our industrial strategy will depend we be create british growth fund that will fuse pension investment and venture capital market we be expand the office for investment to ensure that international investor receive the information and guidance they need to invest in britain and we be cut red tape to remove redundant reporting requirement while make it easy for company to re domicile themselves in the uk and all this within day of our take office from more right for more productive workforce to pioneer industrial strategy for our sector of the future to score of investment worth ten of billion of pound this government be deliver change the last government scattergun approach to growth leave our country starve of investment economically divide and struggle to maintain our competitive edge in the global economy growth be anaemic wage growth flatline on their watch productivity be down the gap between france germany and the united states double since we see the low investment share as percentage of gdp in the and we rank out of in the oecd last year that be on top of the state of the public finance that the conservatives leave we with public service starve of investment million of day of work lose to strike action and rocket debt however in just day this government have already lay down the blueprint for year of growth through our big and most innovative sector secure billion in new investment that underline our potential as world leader in renewable energy life science technology and clean growth and bring forward raft of reform to create happy more secure and more productive workforce the minister be make very interesting and important speech and she have set out exactly what this government be do to benefit my constituent could she find some time to meet so that we can discuss how together we can ensure that the people of newcastle under lyme and staffordshire more widely can benefit from the investment secure at the summit this week be always happy to meet and to talk about what more we can do in our next day and indeed we hope our next five to year in government some conservative members have question whether some of these investment be tee up under the last government they know perfectly well that business confidence can rapidly change investment decision all the announcement include be of new firm commitment be make by company to invest in the uk either when final investment decision have be take or when announcement have be accelerate or unlocked because of action take and support provide by this government be sure that conservative members will have see the letter publish in the times at the start of the week from five of the world big bank join by private equity firm insurer and tech giant say that it be time to invest in britain and that britain great stability have increase its attractiveness to investment which be of course reference to labour decision when we take office they conclude we be optimistic about the future of the economy and believe it be time to invest in britain the fact that score of investor attend our summit on monday with ten of billion of pound be firmly committed to new project show that under this labour government business and investor have great deal of confidence in our growth mission the minister be talk about confidence but if confidence be rise can she explain why the institute of directors have state that confidence have go from plus in june to minus today the shadow minister know that we be work very closely with business business organisation and other to ensure that the change we bring in grow our economy we have huge confidence from raft of people for every quote the hon gentleman can find can find that say the opposite he can pick on one if he want to but suggest that billion do not lie let we not forget that our summit on monday be organise in matter of week the conservative party have two year between their investment summit yet we secure double the amount of investment compare with its summit last year to respond to couple of other point the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for st albans daisy cooper rightly mention business rate we be look at that and will deliver on the commitment in our manifesto she be right to raise skill which be huge challenge for we we see huge opportunity for growth across the entire country but we must ensure that we have the skill landscape which be why we be set up skills england she also talk about the national wealth fund and its ability to crowd in funding for the green sector and green technology it absolutely will do that to summarise across the house we be unite in the belief that britain need to facilitate growth let we face it we have be severely starve of it only through growth can we keep taxis low for work people invest in our public service and create secure well pay high skilled job of course this be against backdrop of the poor economic inheritance leave by the conservative party who lurch repeatedly from prime minister to prime minister give we seven growth plan in year make million of people pay the price of trussonomics budget and saddle the people of britain with low growth low productivity low investment economy the step that this labour government have take in just day show that we be overturn the conservatives legacy of inaction stagnation and deterioration and create country of stability innovation and prosperity question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the international investment summit telegraph poles planning permission motion make and question propose that this house do now jones know that number of colleague have experience similar problem in their constituency to those will be raise and will try to accommodate intervention welcome the minister for data protection and telecoms my hon friend the member for rhondda and ogmore chris bryant to his place be sure hon member from all party welcome his statement in july we fully understand people concern about the excessive deployment of telegraph pole and be urgently consider option to address this as time be short will focus on the current absence of requirement to consult resident under the legislative and regulatory regime that minister have inherit this be not about be against telegraph pole nor be it about be against the roll out of fast broadband new infrastructure be vital in society that be increasingly dependent on fast and reliable internet service however surely it be wrong that when pole be sit inappropriately recourse for resident be advisory only and in many case completely lack in practice official statistic suggest that in my birmingham northfield constituency almost of resident have access to superfast broadband know that ministers have some scepticism about the accuracy of those figure but it be undeniable that broadband coverage be well than in neighbour rural area yet urban area be the current focus for the roll out the case for the change in that establish the current permit development regime focus almost exclusively on the need to extend superfast broadband to rural area and new build estate little to no consideration appear to have be give to how the legislation would impact already build up urban area the consequence be now be see in south birmingham as some resident be leave to accommodate pole that be unwanted unneeded and obtrusive rise rise will give way first to my near neighbour my hon friend be make an excellent speech and it be much need as he say many of our constituent already have excellent broadband so telegraph pole should be strategically prioritise in rural area in one of my street alone there be five pole have previously ask the government how many pole they think be acceptable do he agree that this be not the way that provider should behave know that my hon friend have be do extensive work on this issue there be similar problem in my birmingham northfield constituency and would be sympathetic to have different approach in rural semi rural and build up urban area precisely because of the issue she raise thank my hon friend for organise this excellent debate telegraph pole be key issue in my halesowen constituency my constituent support the roll out of high speed broadband but they be concerned about the installation of telegraph pole in area that do not previously have they community engagement have not be do well give the example of the squirrels estate in my constituency where recent campaign which support be successful in stop company roll out telegraph pole in an area that do not have they the resident major concern be about the use of underground ducting do my hon friend agree that if there be accessible infrastructure underground already broadband provider should use that the government should change the regulation so that provider be able to share the infrastructure even if they be competitor thank my hon friend for make those point he highlight issue that be common across the wide region and suspect the country will come on to some of the regulatory change that could be make but it be important to recognise that there be requirement for company to share infrastructure wherever possible however will discuss some of the case in my constituency where that clearly be not happen want to draw attention to some of the problem in my constituency recently attend resident meeting in street in birmingham northfield call pineview quiet cul de sac that be set back from busy road the community be close knit and over the year the resident have invest their time and considerable amount of money to ensure the upkeep of the area they have live with underground telecommunication infrastructure which serve different operator and they have experience positive service however resident report that four telegraph pole be instal on the road last year start early in the day and finish late at night with intrusive spotlight to facilitate the work there be very limited community engagement despite the resident take up the company brsk suggestion that petition be collect that be do but to no effect also draw attention to lovell close in weoley it be another small cul de sac with only half dozen house and narrow pavement but activity by two compete company be now cause obstruction for resident and user of an adjoining public park the hope that the infrastructure would be share be not be observe in practice and there be ongoing problem with pavement parking across south birmingham know that transport ministers be look separately at this issue but the fact be that the combination of pavement parking and the loss of pavement space to pole have create obstruction and pinch point this be particular problem for those with pram and mobility scooter there be also problem in the bournville conservation area which discuss recently with the bournville village trust place on record my thank for the local representation that have be make to in advance of this debate by councillors esther rai miranda perks and jamie tennant in my constituency and liz clements and fred grindrod in the neighbouring ward of bournville and cotteridge also want to mention the work do on this issue by my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill as she say she be address the same problem in her constituency and my other constituency neighbour my hon and gallant friend the member for birmingham selly oak al carns as front bencher he be unable to speak in this debate but know that he be address the same problem and have write to ofcom on this matter in stourbridge in the west midland we face similar problem with the same company which be cause havoc as my hon friend rightly say the legislation be pass in yet in we be still wait for the full roll out of ultrafast broadband although appreciate what he say about our current adequate speed they could be much fast when be recently in ukraine experience far well internet connectivity than do in central london or stourbridge town centre our european neighbour be enjoy much fast broadband while we languish behind and stourbridge resident have be leave at the mercy of these third party company the hon lady might like to sit while be stand have previously tell members that intervention should be short and spontaneous it be not an opportunity to read out pre prepare speech if she want to speak in this debate she could have ask permission from both the minister and the member in charge and that would have be acceptable thank you madam deputy speaker completely agree with my hon friend the member for stourbridge cat eccles will be brief madam deputy speaker wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield laurence turner about engagement be hold letter that resident receive from my predecessor contain the promise from the company involve in roll out these pole in inkberrow that the work would initially be do underground lo and behold couple of week later pole appear and work be carry out late into the night re establish co operation and engagement with the community be vital to regain trust completely agree with my hon friend who make his case well this be not about say that there can never be telegraph pole as there be some area where they be clearly the right solution however there must be proper process and company can not be leave to mark their own homework he highlight well the issue in his constituency one of the few requirement place on network operator be to provide day notice in write to the local planning authority when they propose to put up pole that be very low bar without comment on an active investigation it should be note that ofcom be currently investigate brsk for an allege failure to notify birmingham city council day prior to instal pole it be important that the investigation be conclude quickly understand that the industry body the internet service providers association which thank for provide briefing ahead of the debate be work on potential revision to the cabinet and pole siting code of practice hope we will hear something encouraging from the minister but as long as the code remain voluntary it will always be circumvent in some case the code of practice merely state that follow advice for engage and consult resident the code operator should place site notice in as close proximity as possible if an appropriate place to site notice be not available another mean of inform resident may be discuss and agree upon in seek to address these concern number of resident in my constituency have individually and collectively attempt to follow the step set out in the code of practice include the complaint process however the code of practice in its current form fail to provide sufficient redress it state that complaint procedure should be in place but it fail to go far than company provide write response detail why complaint be accept or reject frankly that be not good enough we must focus on prevent poor practice as well as encourage the good thank the minister for his engagement with hon member across the house on this issue do he agree that in pursuit of the government welcome manifesto commitment to renew push for full gigabit coverage by well code of practice be need do he agree that there be natural conflict of interest in allow broadband company to be the sole arbiter of their own practice and do he far agree that there should be role for ofcom in uphold the code thank the minister for his attention and look forward to hear how he propose to engage with member across the house on this important issue be sure we will all hear more about this problem throughout the course of this parliament as this be the first time that have see you in the chair madam deputy speaker may say how glad be that you be elect vote for you so there laughter it be secret ballot so you can check congratulate my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield laurence turner on his election it be good to see he in his place think be right in say that king norton be part of his patch but he may not be aware that one of the shield on the wall of this chamber be for former member for king norton who be kill in the second world war very brave man who fight for his country and who die make it possible for everybody to evacuate ronnie cartland be his name he be conservative but his first rebellion be when he be angry that the government be not do enough for distressed area include in my constituency in south wales feel have an affinity with my hon friend constituency although hope have not prompt he to rebel instantly be delighted to have the opportunity to have this debate will be very clear the vast majority of company operate in this sphere be do so entirely responsibly they be do great favour for the nation in roll out broadband of the kind of speed that everybody want note the point that my hon friend the member for stourbridge cat eccles make about other country in europe of course we aspire to that coverage for everybody across the uk the vast majority of company be operate responsibly but frankly few be behave like cowboy as government and as parliament think we sometimes need to say to cowboy that they be drink in the last chance saloon have make that abundantly clear to some of the operator know that some operator be strive to co operate with one another and with bt openreach to ensure that no unnecessary street furniture suddenly appear and that there be full consultation with the local community before road be dig up for new duct or new pole appear company that be abide by the code of conduct and fulfil their obligation be almost as feed up as my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield and other hon friend indeed be sure we could fill the whole chamber with hon member who be equally feed up with the few company that be bring the whole system into disrepute that matter because in the end the most important thing be that the wide strategy be right we want to deliver good value very high speed more than ultrafast gigabit capable broadband base on fibre to the whole uk as fast as possible without have to provide vast amount of taxpayer money we therefore need to do so on the basis of commercial roll out of course it be right that that should not be on the basis of monopoly and that competition where possible should drive choice for consumer and cheap price that part of the strategy be absolutely right the part of the strategy that the previous government be bit more relaxed about in fact ministers use to say categorically that they be completely relaxed about it be overbuild that have mean several company dig up the road one after another as have happen in some part of the country it have also mean several company decide that they need their own set of pole or pole appear in an area that have never previously have pole and in which duct have be lay out but not use be not completely relax about overbuild be concerned about it because know that lot of constituent up and down the land be concerned however want to make sure that commercial operator that be abide by the rule and the code of conduct have every opportunity to continue to do so in order that their commercial investment be not disrupt unnecessarily and we can deliver the infrastructure that we need across the whole united kingdom in the end want the cheap possible price for people and the high possible capacity across the network for every property in the land would issue one slight corrective in this debate sometimes people say that this be battle between urban and rural but in fact some of the issue in urban area be completely different from those in rural area and some be identical be not sure whether that dichotomy be fair my preference be for duct wherever possible that be not always possible for whole series of different logistical reason in different area it be an undeniable fact that provide connectivity via pole be likely to be something like time cheap than do it via duct so fully understand why commercial operator want to install pole understand that that could mean that there will be pole in area that have never have they before and in some area that be something that we will have to live with thank my hon friend for give way and agree with almost everything that he have say also wish to reflect on the move tribute that he make to predecessor member for king norton understand the case that my hon friend have make and welcome his comment do he accept that when the price of pole be already cheap there be risk that some company will undercut each other on consumer service to reach low margin that be at the heart of the issue that we be debate today it be about those operator and local case in which standard have not be follow good network provider should have nothing to fear from the change that have be suggest tonight yes agree with every word that my hon friend have just say he put it extremely well he probably ought to be the minister and perhaps he will be soon he be right also want to say that we should have share infrastructure wherever that be possible legislation already make provision for some of that to happen in speak to the operator have lay it down quite firmly that we need to enhance that infrastructure can perfectly understand why commercial operator might say well be not sure that really want to share with my competitor that be why new code of conduct have take while hope that new code of conduct which have discuss with the operator will be lay out very soon there be urgency about this because the roll out be happen this week next week and the week after we need to tackle these issue in short measure not wait long period of time at the very late this code of conduct will be publish in the early new year and encourage everybody in the sector to abide by the code encourage competitor to tell the two or three company that be not play by the rule that they be bring all of they into disrepute the single most important issue for most of these operator be how they will drive take up it be about not just roll out that be their investment but take up when we talk about megabit per second or about gigabit per second many people have no idea what we be talk about the truth be that all of our home and business will need much great broadband capacity in the near future so we do have to roll this out we have to make sure that people understand why they need it the danger be that if this whole process undermine confidence in the roll out it will affect take up it be in the commercial interest of everybody to make sure that we come to well set of solution in this area let go through couple of the specific point that my hon friend raise as he know the cabinet siting and pole siting code of practice be issue in november it set out guidance on good practice relate to deployment encourage operator to site apparatus responsibly and engage proactively with both local authority and the local community and he lay out some of the specific that follow on from that the day notice that need to be give to local council and so on there be some operator not the one my hon friend be talk about but for instance ix wireless which have in my office early this afternoon that be operate different model and different set of issue relate specifically to they there too have try to make it clear what government expectation be as say follow meeting with the operator the industry have commit to revise the code of practice which think will be much tough and the guidance should be publish in the new year however be absolutely clear that if voluntary adherence do not work we reserve the right to change the law we be in earnest about that because we be aware of the concern people have express my hon friend be also right to say that ofcom have state that it would investigate any case where pole be sit in way that be not consistent with the requirement and guideline in place include where they block resident drive or where operator systematically fail to engage with local planning authority suggestion as my hon friend have already refer to ofcom have open an investigation into whether brsk have fail to comply with its obligation be keen to have meeting with brsk and hope that will happen in the next few week do not want to interfere in the process that ofcom be engage in that be matter for ofcom and would not seek to undermine what be effectively quasi judicial operation however want to make sure that brsk fully understand the concern not only of many birmingham mps note the contribution of my hon friend the member for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill early but of the government in this field commend my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield for get the debate so early in his time as member of parliament he be obviously go to be doughty defender of the right of his constituent madam deputy speaker notice that you be nod along know you be not really allow to do that you be shake your head as well you be not allow to do that either none the less think you broadly agree with the thrust of what be say so feel as if have unite the house on that note bid you farewell question put and agree to house adjourn
