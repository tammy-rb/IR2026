parliament will the prime minister show that he and his government can be more than student politician by ask the speaker to order mr perkins do not need any more your voice carry it be like mine too

labour government fourteen year and they never do it once last year the national audit office identify billion black hole in the ministry of defence finance the former defence secretary say that the

dangerous his chancellor budget do not even mention defence the chancellor budget last week be copy and paste of bidenomics it turn out that high spending high borrowing and high inflation approach be less popular than she may have think may suggest that he now urge she to change course or be he determined to be one term leader the one thing that learn as leader of the opposition be that it be good idea to listen to what the government be actually say think the right hon lady just say that defence be not mention in the budget it be seven day ago that it be absolutely clear and central to the

secretary raise the minimum wage last year have strong record on this we need to make sure that we balance the book the prime minister scripted line show that he have not even listen to the budget himself so will try different question perhaps he can give something that be unscripted to the people who be watch farmer across the united mr order do not need any help if anybody want to leave will help they do that be go to hear the question and certainly want to hear the answer as well so please let we have some courtesy we have hear the prime minister on television repeat the line fix the

become the first black leader of uk wide party major and historic achievement president elect trump praise vladimir putin invasion of ukraine he call it genius he also say that he would encourage russia to do whatever the hell they want to nato ally so what action be the prime minister take to encourage trump presidency to change its mind otherwise it be huge threat to global security and national security in the uk do the prime minister agree that if the us will not oppose president putin and support our brave ukrainian ally the uk must lead in europe so that together we do be very proud that in this house we be unite on the question of ukraine and clear about russian aggression and we will continue to be so have long take the view that the only winner if we be divide in this house be putin and be not prepared to let that happen our relationship with the us be strong relationship forge in very difficult circumstance historically it remain as strong today as it be when it be first forge and look forward to work with president elect trump to ensure that that relationship stay the special relationship be grateful for the prime minister comment on ukraine but donald trump have also say that trade war be good he call himself tariff man people be really worried that trump trade war and tariff will damage our economy damage business and hit the cost of live here in the uk give that do the prime minister recognise that it be more urgent than ever that we support our british economy by get rid of the damaging trade barrier with europe put in place by the conservatives as the right hon member will know we make the economy the centrepiece of our budget and we will do everything that we need to do to ensure that our economy grow and that be measure in living standard go up for work people across the country many family across aldershot and farnborough have struggle for year to get their child with special educational need the help that they need it be therefore shameful to read the misguided claim make by the leader of the opposition that autistic people may well get well treatment and receive economic privilege and protection will the prime minister stand with the family of autistic child and distance the government from those awful word will leave the leader of the opposition to respond to those word as the recent national audit office report expose child with special educational need and disability be be fail by the system under the previous government this have come up think five time in the last two or three week at pmq it be clearly serious issue our focus will be on ensure that every child receive the right support to succeed in their education northern ireland be consider one of the most dangerous place in europe to be woman have be kill in the last four year but one of the most dangerous place for woman and girl be online pay tribute to belfast and lisburn women aid which be tireless in its advocacy of woman what be the

constituency we must create safe world online for woman and girl through the online safety act mitigate the risk of illegal content and activity that be abusive or incite hatred everyone in southwark will benefit from the positive measure in last week budget especially the thousand of people on minimum wage who will get real term increase to help themselves their family and the economy the new leader of the tory party this week leader be on record as say that she want to scrap the minimum wage have seemingly learn nothing from july will the prime minister pledge to protect the minimum wage and increase it in this parliament as finance allow the previous labour government transform the labour market with the national minimum wage that be oppose by the conservatives at the time and sadly they do not seem to have change be surprise by the comment of the leader of the opposition be surprised to see the new shadow business secretary say that the minimum wage be something that legislator pass to make themselves feel good disagree be very proud of the fact that this labour government have raise wage for million low pay worker and expect the conservative party to welcome that after year shape the uk long term strategy for life science agritech fusion and space welcome the government industrial strategy however too many of our great company be be buy out by our competitor to build the industry of tomorrow here we need to unlock some of the hundred of billion of pound in uk pension fund in the city only of which be now invest in uk equity with the new lord mayor make that priority and the mansion house speech imminent will the new government commit to see through the previous government reform to unlock british capital for british research and development growth thank the hon

include over billion to support our world lead life science sector through the british growth partnership we will crowd in pension fund investment to support innovative business and we have launch our landmark pension review to unlock billion of pound of investment into the uk and boost growth and living standard across the country as the chancellor say last week we be leave toxic legacy by the previous government include river fill with polluted waste will the prime minister put the river wye into special measure by designate it water protection zone and will he meet and the excellent cross border wye catchment partnership to deliver its plan to clean up the wye the river wye be one of our most important and iconic river and we be work closely with the welsh government on that press issue the destruction of our waterway should never have be allow that be why we have launch water commission to attract investment and speed up infrastructure delivery and why we have introduce legislation to enable tough penalty and severe fine to crack down on polluter will ensure that my hon friend get meeting with the relevant minister call the father of the house as good lawyer the prime minister will want to listen to the evidence so if evidence mount from expert and organisation such as the national farmers union that small family farm of average acre will be severely impact by the tax change will he in spirit of compromise listen to that evidence keep an open mind and perhaps be prepared to raise the threshold in order to preserve our family farm we be listen to farmer and the environment secretary and treasury ministers meet with the nfu on monday we have take fair and balanced approach the vast vast majority of farm will not be affect what will also say be that have grow up in rural community know that rural community also need an nhs that be back on its foot school that their child can go to and home that their family can afford to live in but we will continue to talk to the nfu and other this week the leader of the opposition tell we that any outrage at suitcase full of wine and karaoke machine in downing street while people across the country be tell to stay at home be all overblown for the people and business in my constituency who follow the rule many of we at great personal cost this be an insult will the prime minister join in ensure that we as country learn the lesson from covid and that the conservatives as party learn the lesson of their behaviour too across the country people make enormous sacrifice during covid they miss wedding birth and death really important moment in their and their family live in do so they save the life of people they will probably never meet that be collective effort and unfortunately the party opposite who set the rule do not follow they themselves it be betrayal of those who do and think the leader of the opposition be wrong to describe the public anger and upset as overblown be sure she will want to clarify that at the first opportunity call llinos medi diolch llefarydd representative of glan rhos nursing home in my constituency tell that the budget change mean increase in their in year cost staggering extra will the prime minister reconsider the rise in employer national insurance what we do in last week budget be ensure that no one would face tax rise in their payslip we have to deal with the billion black hole but when we do so we protect the small business and charity we double the employment allowance to mean that of employer will not pay employer national insurance contribution company with four employee or few on the minimum wage will pay no employer nic at all and half of business that pay nic will see no change or pay less after the budget my constituent be

if he do not why have he not remove the whip no do not as semi retired violinist and rock musician ask semi retired multi instrumentalist feel confident that the prime minister share my belief in the

he home yes we be committed to push the government of india on this important case the foreign secretary have raise it and will continue to do so and we will ensure that we speak to my hon friend as we do so that complete prime minister question on point of order mr speaker do the leader of the opposition want to correct the record as she say in prime minister question that the chancellor do not mention defence spending in her budget yet the chancellor mention it many many time include its allocation of billion which far exceed our commitment it be not for to correct the record and that be not point of order but the right hon lady have do it small boat crossings urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the home department to make statement on the recent increase in dangerous illegal and unnecessary channel crossing by small boat for too long smuggling gang have be undermine our border security and put life at risk which be why the new government have make it top priority to address the crisis we inherit let we be clear about what that crisis entail small boat crossing in the first half of the year at their high point on record and over arrival in the five year prior over case stick in the asylum system cost the taxpayer billion in support and million spend on gimmick that send just four volunteer to rwanda when we enter government we say it be time for grip not gimmick and that be exactly what we be deliver since july we have establish the border security command head by experienced police chief martin hewitt in the king speech we set out our intention to bring forward legislation to give the border security system strong power to investigate and prosecute organise immigration crime we be recruit new specialist agency and investigation officer at the national crime agency to target and dismantle the criminal network behind this phenomenon we have also announce an extra million to bolster border security bring our investment in the border security command over the next two year to million this government border security funding boost will go towards range of enforcement and intelligence activity and capability include covert technology as well as hundred of staff and specialist investigator as we crank up the pressure on the smuggling gang this be an international problem require international solution since the general election we have intensify co operation with partner overseas we recently strike new anti smuggling action plan with partner and the prime minister and home secretary both attend the interpol general assembly in glasgow on monday to press the case for much strong and more integrated global response to organise immigration crime as well as tackle the issue upstream we have take action to speed up decision making and step up return of those with no right to be in this country the result of all this action be return since this government take office include increase in enforce return and increase in return of foreign national offender stick plaster and gimmick have fail the smuggler and trafficker have be get away with it for far too long it be time to show they we be serious not with word but with action the security of britain border be paramount and under this government it always will be call the shadow leader of the house chris philp shadow home secretary thank you mr speaker be afraid the government action belie the reality since they come to office people have cross the english channel more than twice the number they have remove that be one and half time the number in the previous four month and more than the same period last year in october alone last month people cross three time high than in last october tragically since this government come to office people have lose their life or go missing more than in the previous month put together and tragically that include woman and child this government decide they choose to cancel the rwanda scheme before it have even start the first flight be due to take off from memory on july but they cancel it have they allow that to go ahead and the scheme to continue the deterrent effect would by now have start we know it work because it work in australia under its operation sovereign borders about year ago we know the deterrent effect of return work it work with albania where we secure reduction in arrival do not just take my word for it the national crime agency say that law enforcement alone be not enough and we need an effective removal scheme to deter crossing the government announcement in glasgow on monday be simply not enough and they repeat work that be under way already the nca and be not the only one say that we need return deterrent just few week ago european commission president ursula von der leyen encourage member state to develop their own return hub outside the european union will the minister follow ursula von der leyen advice and urgently implement offshore processing may also draw attention to the success that belgium have have in stop boat by the shore will the minister ask france to do the same finally because of their failing labour be break their manifesto pledge to end hotel use so will she pledge not to open any more hotel welcome the right hon gentleman the shadow home secretary to his new front bench position what pleasure it be to be opposite he be go to look forward to joust with he over the year on the rwanda scheme during the period from when it begin to when we scrap it people cross in small boat if that be deterrent the right hon gentleman have peculiar view of the meaning of deterrence in the english language when realise that we be do this urgent question take the opportunity to look at the right hon gentleman record as home office minister during his first stint at the home office from september to people cross the channel on small boat during his second ministerial sojourn at the home office people cross the channel in small boat so his overall total be in september the shadow home secretary answer an urgent question he say that the last government would not rest until we have take the necessary step to completely end these crossing official report september vol how do that go in cross the channel since then more than have cross the majority of they on the conservatives watch all they could introduce be ridiculous gimmick such as rwanda which cost taxpayer million of pound do the minister agree that the new injection of cash into border security command be well use of taxpayer money than the gimmick that the conservatives introduce yes agree wholeheartedly the issue here be deal with cross border organise immigration crime to do that we have to talk to our international ally and co operate with they across border that be exactly what the creation of the border security command will do both operationally and politically and we will see the result we now come to the liberal democrat spokesperson join the minister in welcome the new shadow home secretary to his place lead with the chin on the first full day in the job be an interesting approach but if any situation highlight the manifest failing of the last conservative government it be surely this we in this house all want to stop the dangerous channel crossing be afraid that the last government totally fail at that so be surprised we be discuss it today the asylum backlog balloon under the tories the human being we be talk about who be in these small boat be often the victim of smuggling and traffic gang that profit from human suffering do the minister agree that it be therefore imperative that we work in close co ordination than ever before with europol and our french counterpart to smash these criminal network urge the government to address the root cause of the problem not just the symptom we must empower the foreign commonwealth and development office to provide robust aid to region in an increasingly unstable world the hon lady be exactly right this be not about gimmick or have parallel immigration policy that be unconnected with any of the treaty we have sign or international law it be about do the day job and make sure not to leave an inheritor government person backlog by not do the day job the issue with small boat crossing be deal with organised internationally focus immigration crime which often originate in country very far away to tackle this issue we have to co operate with the force of law and order operationally across border and that be what this government be determined to do may welcome the government approach on this issue and the increase in enforce removal since last summer agree with the minister that the way to deal with this issue be to smash the criminal gang urge she to consider what attention she give to the shadow home secretary who when he be home office minister impose hotel on my constituency and be the chief secretary to the treasury for liz truss during the mini budget the shadow home secretary record in office be matter that we may well keep come back to agree with the observation that my hon friend make call the chair of the select committee everybody in this house want an end to small boat crossing and the risk that people take to cross the channel the minister have announce number of measure this week when do she expect those measure to start produce reduction in crossing will she commit to keep the select committee inform on progress it be my first chance to congratulate the right hon lady on her election as chair of the select committee look forward to come before her committee whenever she wish to talk to the department certainly wish to keep she informed about what be go on there have be significant shift in international co operation what with the collaboration on smuggling and the dialogue of the european political community of which there be meeting tomorrow at which we hope there will be some announcement the government have also be work on bilateral memorandum of understanding and action plan across europe to achieve step change in cross border co operation which be the key to beginning to tackle the awful criminal smuggling activity in the five year before the election work on prevent human trafficking in scotland include with many of the victim who come on small boat crossing they have go through the most appalling abuse that chill the soul do the minister agree that public money be far well spend on smash the gang and free the victim than on rwanda plan that be never go to work yes agree profoundly with my hon friend which be why the new government have change tack in this area be sure that we will see the result in due course the government have pledge million of pound to smash the gang on top of the million of pound that we spend on stop the boat the government have pledge more drone on the channel and to fast track case just as we deploy drone on the channel and fast track case the government have set up border security command which sound remarkably similar to the small boat operational command that we set up when in government other than scrap the one thing that would have work that is the deterrent what have this government do that be different that be actually go to stop the boat first the border security command be operationally completely different from the command on the channel which be deliberately there to try to save life and find out what be go on on the water operationally the border security command will co operate across border in very different way if be the right hon and learn lady would not be boast about the colossal morass of waste expenditure that the rwanda scheme million down the drain with plan to spend nearly billion on the plan over the next few year it be gross waste of money that do not deter single boat crossing the gang that run this vile trade care only for their profit not for the life that they put at risk will the minister reassure the house and my constituent in east thanet that the border security command will do everything to break the evil smuggling gang and bring the ringleader to justice yes the point of the increase in operational co operation across border be that if we can not bring people to justice in our jurisdiction we can ensure that information be swap in real time so that they can be bring to justice in other jurisdiction there will be step change in that kind of international co operation which will deliver result will the minister describe clearly and unambiguously without bluster the difference in function between the border security command and the small boat operational command the border security command be not focus only on channel crossing it be much more about use our intelligence capability and our operational arm to co operate across border with other jurisdiction and in real time to ensure that organise criminal gang can be track apprehend and dismantle we have give million extra to the border security command to start to do that work the command on the channel be about save life and co operate with the french once people have reach the beach it be far too late once people have reach the beach we need to go far back to the origin country and do lot more work there will the minister acknowledge the real concern feel by people in the uk and in my city of portsmouth about the small boat crossing do she agree that the increase since last summer in enforce return of people who have no right to be here show what can be do when grow up be in the room and when government focus on get grip absolutely agree with the point my hon friend make there be conflict globally which along with other factor such as poverty food insecurity and the effect of climate change cause population to move do the minister agree that as my hon friend the member for hazel grove lisa smart point out it be essential that we look at the root cause of immigration do she therefore support an increase in the development and aid budget rather than the cut in official development assistance in last week budget in the end any work that we can do upstream whether in respect of development or aid will deal with some of the cause some of which the hon lady rightly point out we have to stay within the bound set by the budget but assure she that regard prevention as much well than cure this government inherit situation on our border in which there be failure on all front there be record number of tragic death in the channel million waste on the fail rwanda gimmick and criminal gang profiteer off exploit our border will the minister reassure my constituent that unlike the previous government we will not waste time on political gimmick but will focus on the practical measure that can bring an end to the persistence of these damn failure assure my hon friend that we will do exactly that it be why we have see step change in return since this government take office there have be in that period which include increase in enforce return and increase in return of foreign national offender we will ensure that our immigration system have integrity sometimes when listen to the exchange between labour front benchers and the conservatives we can forget that we be deal with real people who be flee the most unimaginable horror aside from the bizarre rwanda plan why be the minister continue with the same fail approach as the tories the government continue to spend million on hotel drone and various bit of high tech how about try something different how about look at safe and legal route in order to smash the gang and how about show some compassion be not go to get into competition with the hon gentleman about compassion we have duty to ensure that asylum seeker who come to our shore be properly process and deal with and integrate in our society if asylum be grant interruption despite the hon gentleman chuntere away be not go to stand here and say that we will let people smuggler who exploit people for money decide who come to our country we have to stop this trade that be not at odd with treat those who arrive here with compassion when stand for election on july this year my commitment to my voter be that we would smash the criminal gang and stop the small boat at that point the number of small boat crossing be high than in the bad ever year do the minister welcome the datum that show that the number be now low than in yes but the house have to have patience there be no magic wand to wave in this policy area and there be no fantasy policy now that we have get rid of the rwanda scheme there be hard day to day operational work to try to get the system that we inherit which be in complete chaos with huge backlog back into some kind of order so that we can run it properly fairly and efficiently that be what we be focus on recently listen to an interview with retire former inspector of border and immigration who be respond to the government announcement he outline his concern about the impact of the measure on their own without an effective deterrent and about how the government will measure their success the percentage or volume by which they want to see small boat crossing reduce after the announcement what percentage reduction in small boat crossing would the government view as success be not get into number game in the house we be try to deal with and dismantle trade that be allow to become establish and industrialise on the previous government watch be not go to stand here and say it happen overnight but we will make progress folk in plymouth be really interested in how the government will solve this big problem they will welcome the increase in money towards deal with the problem and the increase in return another thing they want be constructive lively debate with idea in this place unfortunately the opposition seem so devoid of idea that they will bang on for another four year about their landmark rwanda policy to stop the boat fail scheme that get firmly reject by the electorate do the minister agree that the first sign of insanity be try the same thing over and over again and expect different result yes in the home office annual report it be confirm that in billion be spend on hotel cost for illegal migrant average million day the cruel inheritance tax assault on british family farm and business be estimate eventually to raise million year do the labour government need to rethink their spending priority urgently no we have just have budget which we be in the middle of debate and will be vote on and expect that that will be the way we go forwards the increase in return of people who have no right to be here be really positive step in give the public confidence in our system what measure be in place to continue to ensure that our process remain robust and that the trajectory of return continue we be ensure that the enforcement part of the home office that deal with return be give the resource it need to do that job but to make it even more successful we have to engage with those country to which we wish to return people so that we can have paper issue again the significant shift in international co operation be what will deliver that if rwanda be gimmick why be germany austria bulgaria cyprus the netherlands poland and romania look at similar scheme give the number of crossing and death in the channel would it not with hindsight have be wise at least to have allow the rwanda scheme trial run those country be not consider rwanda scheme they be all say that they will stay within the confine of international law the rwanda scheme definitely tear up international law and it be plan to spend nearly billion up until on try to remove people week from this country and to spend nearly billion on extra detention camp for they in this country do not think that represent british value or good value for money give that only of people who arrive by small boat between and june have be return period of reflection from the conservative party on this issue would be welcome do the minister agree that government who have dispense with gimmick and who focus on the day job be deliver that progress on return yes but let we not underestimate the fact that under the illegal migration act nobody who arrive in that way could be process so people be wait to be process because the previous government stop the system dead we have to get the processing system go again that be what we be do so that we can get the flow of decision return those who be not entitle to be here and integrate those who be entitle to stay the government have mandate for try out their approach and wish they well have always feel that unless the boat be intercept and turn back near the start of their journey nothing will deter people from use that method will the minister whom respect greatly explain how it be possible to smash gang who operate in other jurisdiction once they get to the point where they withdraw their headquarters to country where there be no possibility of co operation with the authority in charge of those state well get to that level of withdrawal would be fantastic development that would put incredible pressure on many of the supply line currently be use if we could get to that stage we would have already make significant progress the answer to what the right hon gentleman be talk about be international co operation to put the maximum pressure on this terrible international trade in human life and exploitation be glad that he be give little bit of time to prove that we can make difference people in west brom be appal by these criminal smuggling gang do the minister agree that the last government waste million on the totally fail rwanda scheme could she set out how the new government be go to fix the situation yes and the repurposing of some of that money and resource that have not be lose be fund the new approach do the minister agree that the loss of life be colossally too high on these channel crossing include the loss of two year old child just the other week do she also agree that we should reopen safe route so that we can treat those come to this country with the dignity and respect that they deserve do not believe that safe route would stop people from attempt to come over the channel in small boat have some sympathy with the idea of safe route but do not think they would stop this trade for example indians come across and we have visa regime with the indians the high nationality for small boat arrival this year be the vietnamese again it be not always about people who be asylum seeker come over it be people who do not have right to be here but be pay to come here safe route would not solve that problem the shadow home secretary refer to the life lose in the channel every single one of they be tragedy but do the minister agree that his try to make political point about those death as he appear to do be beneath the conservative party as be gimmick such as the rwanda scheme yes agree the loss of life in the channel this year have be the high on record and that be because more pressure be be put on the gang the boat be be overload and there be more anarchy on the beach in france those be all thing that we have to try to deal with in co operation with our french colleague my constituent want to see an end to the small boat crossing and an end to the use of hotel for asylum seeker as pledge in the government manifesto will the minister undertake to ensure that where hotel have see asylum seeker move out more be not put back in the issue with hotel and other dispersal accommodation be that we have inherit backlog owe to the way in which the conservatives run the system there be no processing of asylum seeker who then have to be put up in hotel hotel be temporary not solution we will do our good to get out of deal with hotel as quickly as possible by get the system up and run and process those who be make claim so that we can get they either approve and integrate or return the government come to power this year in the bad year on record for small boat crossing which be high than in the previous record year of that be the legacy of chaos leave by the last government there be no room for complacency but do the minister agree that we should be welcome the now low level of small boat crossing this year compare with agree that the first six month of this year be the bad on record there be then quiet three month and now there have be huge increase not least because of benign weather condition do not want to get into monthly figure we need to bear down on the organise criminality that be perpetrate the trade to disrupt it and deal with it that way do the minister recognise the distinct lack of humanity about this urgent question and the discussion surround small boat and migration do she not recognise that those people who risk all to get into those very dangerous boat and cross the chancel be do so in an act of desperation the lack of safe route system across europe have create market for people trafficker instead of the current approach do she not think it necessary to look seriously at safe route for asylum seeker to avoid the tragedy of all these death in the channel and for that matter in the mediterranean say early that safe route would not stop all the channel crossing there be now an industrialise system run by organise immigration criminal the vietnamese would never have safe route into the uk there be no visa system yet they now comprise of the people cross on small boat with all due respect to the right hon gentleman do not think that safe route would solve the problem the last government be responsible for an asylum backlog so large that they end up spend million of pound of taxpayer money every day on asylum hotel include in my constituency as the minister say we be now deal with that legacy and welcome her statement do she agree that we will take no lesson from the conservative party and that we will continue to make progress towards our manifesto commitment to bring down the backlog and end hotel use could not have put it well myself think there be unanimity in the house that this be moral issue when raise the issue of deterrence with the home secretary at her last statement on july she seem to agree that we need deterrent since then the government do not seem to have bring forward any specific deterrence if not the rwanda scheme will the minister look at the scheme that other european nation be consider to see whether we can deter the small boat crossing the way to deter the small boat crossing be to deal with those who be organise and profit from that immoral trade that be what we be do the shadow home secretary the right hon member for croydon south chris philp and conservative members be still bang the drum for the fail rwanda gimmick do the minister agree that if the previous government be so confident that that policy would work they would not have call an election before that theory could be put to the test my hon friend make an intriguing point give that conservative members have say repeatedly that they be about to start the rwanda scheme the week after the election and that all of sudden it would work and be perfect after people cross in small boat know that the scheme be legislate for and in place suspect somehow that the date of the election might have have bit to do with the fact that they realise the rwanda scheme would fail the minister be claim credit for an increase in deportation of people with no right to be in this country want an approximate figure please of how many of the people who have be send back since the labour government come in arrive here in small boat since give that the conservative party process virtually nobody who come over in small boat they be still in the asylum backlog that we be attempt to deal with be pleased to see this government take swift action to tackle the small boat crisis include scrap the rwanda scheme which be not only ludicrously expensive but inhumane and ineffective will the minister confirm that it be possible to manage our border in way that be both effective and humane and that we will do that that be certainly the balance that this government be aim to achieve the minister have say that her policy to smash the criminal gang will reduce the number of migrant cross the channel can she give the house her estimation of when that policy will start to work say in an early answer that there be no magic wand in this area tough operational processing and international co operation will begin to bear down on this and work by the national crime agency and by prosecutorial authority often cross border in different jurisdiction the fact that we have make such good start with international co operation and the significant shift in attention here will bear down on this but will not stand at this dispatch box and pretend that there be an easy timeframe or answer for when that will have the effect that we all want it to have we will bear down on it and we will make progress at time of highly stretch resource right across government thank to the mess in the public finance leave by the conservative party my constituent will be pleased that million have be secure for further investment in the border security command do the minister agree that it be far well use of taxpayer money than pay people to go to rwanda or housing they in hotel at great expense yes it be advisable to try to deal with the immediate cause of the problem organise immigration criminality as well as bear down on the long term cause which often be about political stability in other area of the world thank the minister for her answer want to take slightly different look welcome the fact that smuggler will now be treat use terrorism power as it be my firm belief and the belief of this house think that the continue abuse of the asylum system be tantamount to an invasion can the minister assure we that those who come across the northern ireland border will also be subject to the terrorism provision border security bill will be introduce perhaps the hon gentleman will want to serve on the committee so that he can be certain that the point he just make be accurately reflect by the government in that bill one of the most colossal failure under the previous government be the chaos in the channel and the associate backlog in the system yet the conservatives seem to have come here today to tell the british people that they have it all under control can the minister reassure my constituent of the serious step she be take to disrupt the gang speed up return and end this chaos yes my hon friend constituent can be assure that great deal of work be go on and more resource be be apply lot more intelligence be be gather much of which can not be discuss publicly we be on it strongly welcome the government focus on tackle the root cause of organise crime behind the small boat rather than the gimmick of the previous government across kent the criminal gang be fuel rise in organised crime and in my constituency that be push up rural crime street crime and antisocial behaviour will my hon friend ensure that the new border security command work closely with kent police to deal with the effect across the whole of kent and the wide country can give my hon friend that assurance some area have suffer particular pressure from this phenomenon over the year and kent be one of they so be acutely aware of the pressure that he and the local authority in that area be under over the past year the conservative party see this issue become grow crisis conservative members have speak much today about how we need deterrent but do the minister agree that for someone who be willing to get into vessel of questionable seaworthiness to cross one of the busy shipping lane on the planet chance of trip to kigali be not deterrent the only way of get handle on this be to go back to where the problem originate wait for people to get to the channel be delay the response and create the crisis that the conservatives oversee agree very much with my hon friend observation and so do the figure between the date of the announcement of the rwanda scheme and the date of the last general election people come across in small boat interruption the right hon member for croydon south chris philp say that it have not start then the conservatives begin by say that rwanda would be deterrent when their bill be publish and then every time it make no difference they take it back and say it will work it will work it would never have work it cost million and they have budget but not budget for nearly billion of expenditure by the end of that scheme give that at the end of under the last conservative government the asylum backlog have reach an elevenfold increase in year do my hon friend agree that conservative members who be very small in number for their own urgent question be exhibit high degree of audacity they be indeed and perhaps they should also be remind that return collapse on their watch as well personal statement order before call the hon member for ashfield lee anderson to make his personal statement remind the house that such statement should be hear in silence and without interruption with permission mr speaker will make personal statement in compliance with the finding of the independent expert panel in its report accept the finding of the panel and the parliamentary commissioner for standards in full and without reservation on november at the derby gate entrance be involve in an incident with security guard during the incident speak to the complainant in manner that be totally unacceptable and which include swearing and other language that go against the house of commons bully and harassment policy would like to apologise to the complainant and to the house for my behaviour our security staff do an incredible job and should always be treat with the utmost respect an mp behaviour must always be of high standard give you mr speaker and the house my firm assurance that have learn significant lesson through this process and firm undertaking that such behaviour on my part will never happen again thank the hon member point of order on point of order mr speaker have you receive any notice of statement from the government know that number of member have write to the foreign secretary in particular about the case of the writer and human right activist alaa abd el fattah who have serve five year in an egyptian prison for organise human right protest he be mean to be release in september but have still not be his mother laila have now be on hunger strike for four week and many of we be concerned about the risk to her life if statement be not forthcoming perhaps those on the treasury bench could urge the

purpose let begin by pay tribute to the right hon theresa villiers the former member for chipping barnet who previously work hard to bring this bill through parliament and by thank rebecca pow the former member for taunton deane who also endeavour to secure ban on the sale of peat somerset be one of only two county in england where peat extraction still take place the somerset level and moor be the second large area of lowland deep peat in england contain million tonne of carbon however drain deep peat be major source of greenhouse gas emission and along with peat extraction could be responsible for as much as tonne of per year accord to report publish by eftec somerset peatland be extremely rare and valuable habitat for wildlife they be the perfect place for plant such as the sundew and the marsh violet which in turn support invertebrate and bird population ban the sale of peat and protect our peatland both at home and abroad be crucial say abroad because we offshore most of our peatland emission by import about of the peat use in horticulture in the uk all the major party agree with the proposal for ban the liberal democrats have pledge to restore peatland and ban the use of horticultural peat labour manifesto promise to expand nature rich habitat such as peat bog and the last conservative government make several attempt despite fail to ban peat in their year in office in the previous government say that they want to reduce the amount of peat in compost voluntarily by but as the amount of peat fall by only quarter in the subsequent year the threat of legislation be introduce consultation by the last government also reveal how popular ban be with of respondent favour ban on retail peat by the end of the last parliament however no legislation have be introduce that would ensure ban on sell peat so vast amount of uncertainty remain in the industry today want to be absolutely clear how important it be that the horticultural industry be consider and consult before any legislation seek to ban peat be introduce but ban horticultural peat be the right thing to do and that be already support by vast number of people in the industry and if do correctly will bring huge opportunity for british horticulture in september this year professional grower gardener nursery owner compost manufacturer retailer and supporter of peat free horticulture write to the prime minister demand sale ban the signatory include co op supermarket chris beardshaw alys fowler chris packham the soil association the national trust the wildlife trust cpre evergreen garden care vitacress and the royal horticultural society to name just few recently visit durston garden products just outside street which be the large manufacturer of grow medium in southern england it produce million bag year and it support ban on the sale of peat three quarter of the bag that durston currently produce be peat free five year ago the figure be just one quarter that be because durston like most of the industry take the previous government at their word when they commit to ban the sale of peat durston have do what it believe be the right thing for the business and for the environment and it have put in the time effort and money to develop alternative grow medium that can outperform peat as it stand however the investment that durston have make to prepare for peat free market have be for nothing britain be gardening nation in fact there be million gardener in the country and of they be interested in garden more sustainably the positive reaction to my bill be announce demonstrate the feeling in the industry the chair of the grow media association simon blackhurst tell the industry main trade magazine horticultural week that there be currently an unfair commercial landscape as peat base grow media be cheap than peat free southern trident steve harper say there really be no argument for delay retail peat ban floralive sean higgs say everyone be expect it now or believe it already in reverse would be counterproductive to the industry and undermine it on several count there be many fantastic example of business move towards be peat free one such business be kelways in langport in my constituency which no long sell compost contain peat and understand the shift that need to take place move towards be peat free would help the government to achieve their aim of move towards circular economy peat free compost manufacturer want to keep supply chain close to home and some such as miracle gro have their own on site waste processor to produce compost other have partnership with local forestry and wood processing business rocketgro in somerset process digestate by product of sustainable energy into peat free compost advance in technology be clear evidence of the success of peat free alternative the royal horticultural society be set to be peat free by the end of and be now at the end of second successful year of trial fund by the department for environment food and rural affairs the rhs have grow million of plant peat free in partnership with eight major wholesale grower and develop practice to help the wholesale industry transition smoothly by end the use of horticultural peat at home we can reduce our reliance on foreign import plant grow in peat and support british peat free grower be fully aware that any ban would require exemption time for business to transition and support from the government to help business move forward but set date in stone through legislation would remove the uncertainty that be damage the industry and reduce opportunity turn to the impact that ban on peat would have on peatland peat grow at rate of mm per year but can degrade by cm per year if it be in bad condition which sadly be the case for of our peatland as touch on early they be amazing and rare habitat give our current knowledge of the damage that peat extraction do to nature the environment and the land around we there be simply no excuse for not change course somerset face ever more devastating flooding every winter and the degradation and destruction of our peatland do little to worsen its impact by reduce peatland ability to absorb excess rainwater and act as natural flood defence as an intact peat bog would do whereas prevent the sale of peat open up opportunity for world beat peat alternative stop peat extraction open up opportunity for peat restoration such as create new job by reskille the exist workforce to use their expertise in manage peatland for restoration the destruction of these precious important and beautiful habitat must stop as many expert the public and politician alike have outline we must not miss our chance urge the house to support this bill today and ensure that we take the step that would prevent the release of thousand of tonne of carbon help we move towards circular economy open up opportunity for british horticulture and protect precious peatland be not go to oppose the right of the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke to bring in bill because believe in the right of member to bring forward whatever bills they want most of they be ill conceived and have spend much of my time in this place attack bills that would have unintended consequence think the hon lady bill will fit into the category of bills that have good intention but would have unacceptable unintended consequence it will not go unnoticed that this bill be full frontal attack on british horticulture and that it be be promote by none other than the liberal democrats the hon lady refer to the previous bill which speak against on april it be salutary reminder of the work of democrats in this country that none of the member of this house who support that bill be still member of the house the electorate give their verdict on the ill conceive support for it be delighted to say today that number of my new and not so new colleague have say to why can you divide the house and oppose this bill say to they include my hon friend the members for rutland and stamford alicia kearns and for mid buckinghamshire greg smith that we should allow the liberal democrats to stew in their own juice and bring forward their bill so that it can be criticise and never reach the statute book one would have think from the remark of the hon member for glastonbury and somerton that she be supporter of the horticultural trades association yesterday the association run an event in this house and so many people attend that the free indoor plant on offer be all scoop up about halfway through if the hon lady go to collect her free plant she obviously miss the opportunity to talk to representative of the association who believe that her proposal would completely undermine british horticulture what be most important the hta make this point be that we should have level playing field with european grower we want to grow more tree too few tree be be home grow and too many of they be be import likewise we want to promote garden product but too many of they be be import very large proportion be be import from holland because far from have peat free environment holland be the fast grow export market for peat come into our country holland be also one of the large importer and exporter of peat and it get lot of its peat from germany estonia belgium latvia and sweden the dutch use peat to make horticultural product which be then sell into our market because those product be more acceptable to consumer not least because they tend to last long as peat be substance that enable plant to retain moisture and water lot long than product that be peat free such as coir some of the people who promote peat free product do not seem to realise when they talk about coir as substitute that it be produce mainly in the far east particularly in sri lanka and that it have to be wash and de salt before it can be prepare for horticultural use and then have to be transport halfway across the world that be not an ecologically friendly way of produce peat substitute there be another dimension to the issue of peat what proportion of it be use in horticulture it be very small proportion be tell that about of the peat consume in the world be use for peat fire it be put into domestic boiler and mega incinerator or use as substitute for coal or even natural gas by concentrate on just one aspect of the use of peat in horticulture we be ignore the much large problem of the burning of peat for fuel have look up how easy it be to buy peat for fuel in this country and the late information be that could get pallet of or so bag of peat deliver to my home for that peat come from exactly the same source as peat for agriculture why be we have go at the use of peat in horticulture and agriculture when we could be deal with the much large issue of the extraction of peat for heat our home this be sensitive emotional subject but we need to have some hard head realism around it if you like madam deputy speaker support british horticulture you should be very much opposed to this bill because it be full frontal assault upon the viability of our horticulture industry and will result in less choice for all those who engage in horticulture whether as amateur or professional gardener urge the hon lady to think carefully before she draft her bill if she think that it will be mitigate by have lot of exemption set out in it challenge she to include on the face of her bill all the exemption she think will be necessary because only with thousand of exemption will the bill be in any way acceptable that be the challenge to she that be why be not go to oppose she bring forward her bill let we see what it say but fear it be go to be absolutely ghastly be disappointed because think the liberal democrats be the friend of people work in the countryside and in agriculture and horticulture but this bill suggest quite the reverse strongly oppose it question put standing order no and agree to order that sarah dyke wera hobhouse tim farron pippa heylings martin wrigley caroline voaden carla denyer layla moran tessa munt richard foord vikki slade and steve darling present the bill sarah dyke accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday january and to be print bill way and means budget resolutions income tax charge debate resume order november question again propose that income tax be charge for the tax year and it be declare that it be expedient in the public interest that this resolution should have statutory effect under the provision of the provisional collection of taxes act call jonathan reynolds it be pleasure to open this final day of the debate on the chancellor growth budget can welcome the new shadow team it be lovely to see they in place think many of we on this side would admit that we be shadow ministers for long than we ideally would have be and know that it be tough and thankless job at time on personal level wish they well for the future as the chancellor rightly state growth be our only path to prosperity to increase living standard and to deliver the change that the british people vote for so decisively over the summer and we on these benches recognise that we can not have growth without investment growth demand investment in our infrastructure into our public service into the city and region that have go overlook and under invest in by past administration and that be what this budget choose it choose investment over decline with more than billion of public investment into our road and our railway our park and our playground our school and our surgery all the thing upon which successful economy and healthy society depend this be budget for affordable home for the nhs for the school rebuilding programme and personal priority for as mp for stalybridge and hyde for the trans pennine route upgrade include new station at mossley which be something be sure the whole house can be excited about and get behind this be literally rebuild britain in action and make no mistake business need that public investment too because it create the right environment for they to thrive now and long into the future that be why the office for budget responsibility say that our increase in spending will drive up the long term increase in gdp by up to the secretary of state make much of growth of course we all want growth but the obr report actually say that growth in real gdp will start to slow over the next three year and that in year four and five of the parliament it will go negative it be tell we that the government budget be actually go to result in small private sector not large one how be he go to explain that to business that be not what it say first on the figure we can not make like for like comparison because we know that the information provide by the previous government in their financial information be erroneous they do not square their own spending pledge with what be in those document the analysis by the obr show that long term improvement in gdp growth be vital but the right hon gentleman will recognise that it can not model some of the wide part of the government agenda it can not model those change in the planning system that be so important to the government it can not model the change involve in have long term industrial strategy it can not model our change to trade policy recognise that there be more to do to prove the case of the government overall commitment but can tell the right hon gentleman that fundamentally fix the foundation honesty and stability in the public finance and focus on long term public investment be essential to the long term growth of the country also one thing that have not have sufficient recognition be that many of the real benefit of great public investment do not accrue in this parliament they accrue beyond it and it be about time we have some long term focus again in this country not before time if may say so the right hon gentleman will hope be aware that the long term economic growth of this country rely not primarily on public investment or indeed public infrastructure but on healthy private sector the wealth creator from whom we can take the funding to deliver into those good that he talk about and that be part of balanced and successful society this budget do not help they it do the opposite be sorry but again the right hon gentleman be wrong agree with part of his assessment such as that strong and thriving private sector be crucial to growth but find his analysis little simplistic private firm will say that they also need skilled worker and that they need decent transport system so they can get to work under the last government would often get up in the morning and check my phone for update from people use the trans pennine line just mention the one we be upgrade and it would be full of people say can not get to work need the right hon gentleman to make slightly broad analysis despite the previous government leave we with rag skip fire in many area we have to raise money not to deliver our pledge but to deliver their pledge that they do not properly fund we have have regard and heed for the level of competitiveness in the uk economy for instance on the rise in employer national insurance contribution over half of all firm with national insurance liability will actually pay less or the same not only because of the change to the employment allowance but because of how we have remove the threshold so that all firm now qualify despite the frankly terrible inheritance bequeath to we we have do our good to meet those need and to deliver long term focus on the future will the minister give way be go to move on but can not resist the hon gentleman hope the minister will not be disappoint there be many good thing in what the government have bring forward but what be missing unfortunately be support for farmer on inheritance tax farmer be the backbone of britain and they produce almost all the food we eat across this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland farmer will be impact greatly declare an interest as member of the ulster farmers union and the national farmers union and all the farmer talk to in northern ireland have indicate that every farmer in northern ireland will be affect by inheritance tax if the government want to get it right the threshold need to be raise and it be not too late raise the threshold to million or million so that family farm the backbone of britain can continue always listen to the hon gentleman because he be genuine and conscientious in represent his constituency interest will always listen to what he have to say we can judge the exact impact of these change by look at the value of claim to date the conservative party analysis have forget to aggregate the impact of the change to those allowance such as agricultural property relief alongside the exist nil rate band and the ability to transfer the allowance between spouse in all case the total number of farm across the uk that will be affect by this change be actually only for the financial year that have be miss and remind colleague that any inheritance tax liability have year interest free payment period to be frank there have be some scaremongere from the opposition and we have to be clear with people we have have to restore economic stability to deliver that investment and we should not shy away from explain why this have be so necessary the previous government scattergun approach to growth leave our country starve of investment economically divide and struggle to maintain competitive edge in the global economy the previous government claim to have deliver the fast grow economy in the base on its performance in the first half of this year be laughably false believe that the sunday times liken it to someone walk marathon in six hour but because they run the last yard claim to be the fast runner in the world the truth be that consistency and stability have be sorely lacking we have have seven growth strategy since and business secretaries in as many year to say nothing of the uk revolve door of prime ministers will the minister give way have already give the right hon gentleman go will make little progress and we will see whether he can do well one next time the result be protract period of anaemic growth have our economy grow at the average rate of other oecd country over this period it would have be billion large imagine the difference that would have make to all of our community and to today budget debate british firm face such uncertainty have not see invest domestically as sufficiently attractive proposition they have be reluctant to adopt new technology to upskill their employee or to plough money into research and development we have even hear that in any give year roughly of uk firm choose not to invest at all we want to change that for good we want to give business certainty confidence and stability so that they can make decision for the long term that be why at the budget the chancellor reaffirm our new modern industrial strategy invest will be central pillar of our growth mission the strategy will allow business to plan not just for the next month but for the next year it have already win the backing of make uk which have tell we that business will no long have to fear the constant chop and change in policy we have see over the last decade instead they can focus on the long term our industrial strategy will create strong pro business environment make it simple and cheap for company to scale up and invest it will unleash the potential of our high productivity service and industry because our recent economic history have teach we that we have to play to our strength over the last year high productivity sector be responsible for roughly of our economy entire productivity growth look at the figure since over half of the uk economy gdp growth have come from just three sector information and communication technology financial and professional service and advanced manufacturing that be why our industrial strategy will channel support to eight key growth drive sector those in which the uk service sector will excel both today and tomorrow the service and industry that present the great opportunity for output and productivity growth over the long term how do that all gel with the fact that the obr be say that business investment will fall by as share of gdp by it sound great but it do not add up in the obr eye will the minister please elaborate we have similar question the government wide pro business change can not be model by the obr and we know that we have to prove they there be simply no way that we will get to the high business investment the high productivity growth and the strong economic growth that we need in all part of the country unless we be honest robust and responsible with the public finance as this budget be and the previous government be not if the budget do not set the trajectory for strong long term public investment to leverage in that degree of private investment we will not have the foundation to succeed be so excited by this budget because it give we those strong foundation for the future the problem with our economy be that too often people build small business and then sell they off they do not sit and develop they before potentially hand they on can the minister explain how the propose inheritance tax change will encourage people to take risk in nurture and grow their business in order to pass they on to succeed generation plainly his suggestion will have the reverse effect and will therefore make the situation bad which will damage growth ask the right hon gentleman to look at the detail of our plan from the datum hold by the treasury we can plan for how many firm will be affect and it be very small number in most case give the exist inheritance tax nil rate band especially where property be involve or where there be transfer from one spouse to another in the inheritance chain the allowance be so great that it be already considerably in excess of the average claim for relief in this area the right hon gentleman be talk about very small number of firm at the very large end think the revenue can be raise in way that protect the kind of family firm he and want to see continue to thrive we all know there be case where for instance people advertise the sale of agricultural land or certain type of investment specifically to avoid inheritance tax which be not right that be not good for business we have to recognise that these fair and proportionate change will pay for the last government spending commitment the change will always have benchmark for international competitiveness in way that the right hon gentleman should recognise rather than scaremonger at the budget as statement of intent for our new industrial strategy we see the chancellor make the first of many down payment with multi year funding commitment for these area of our economy there will be significant tax relief for our world lead creative industry up to billion for brand new life science innovative manufacturing fund and nearly billion for our aerospace sector to fund vital research and development into jet zero technology which will boost industry in the east midland the south west and scotland there be also billion for our automotive sector ensure that the next generation of electric vehicle be design develop and build right here in the uk at the same time we recognise that our industrial strategy success rest upon work in partnership with mayor and multinational council and ceo union and academic that be why this government be champion local growth plan growth plan for the long term to be deliver by strong local political leadership which will work together with the government to create the right condition for success crucially our new industrial strategy will be international from the start take learning from the good of what have be achieve globally so that we enable business of all size and sector to thrive in our market to that end it will work in lockstep with our trade strategy and our twin track approach to trade accede to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and negotiating deal with the gulf co operation council and india all to the benefit of british business unlike the previous administration we be also make it much easy for uk firm to do business in and with europe although the opposition might not want to hear it the eu be not just our close trading partner but be still our large trading partner by quite some margin yet the previous government adversarial approach to work with the eu all that incendiary rhetoric be not conducive to good business we be change course aim to remove unnecessary barrier to trade so that british company will be able to operate more easily in france germany italy and across europe we be make real progress early this month the prime minister and the president of the european commission issue joint statement to deepen our co operation on the economy energy and security we have agree to regular eu uk summit to strengthen our connection in all those area include the close business and investment tie that connect our economy on the sector that will benefit do the secretary of state agree that the hospitality sector would benefit more from some honesty and openness the government announce increase for people on the minimum wage many of whom be employ in the private hospitality sector but while our constituent will pay for that the treasury will benefit by hundred of million of pound because almost all those minimum wage earner will become taxpayer overnight the hon gentleman should recognise that the chancellor do not make an announcement on personal tax threshold which for some conservative members be unexpected and reflect the difficult inheritance of the new government labour member be proud of the minimum wage now call the living wage which have be one of the most successful policy in the history of this country and even some conservative claim credit or support the measure as policy innovation there be no doubt about the burden on the hospitality sector because if the living wage go up for people employ in it that be business cost we have to acknowledge that what those business fundamentally need be customer who have some spending power to use their disposable income in those place the rise be not without benefit but recognise that it be painful the future for this country however can not be as low wage low productivity economy that do not give people the living standard they want have be on television many time talk about the stagnant wage of the last government want wage to be high the doubling of the employment allowance in the budget recognise the burden on those type of business which can now employ up to four people on the living wage without any national insurance liability at all we have to have system that accommodate those burden but fundamentally this government be in favour of high wage and we be not go to pull away from that in any measure the secretary of state be right to emphasise the importance of well fund public sector and well provision sector organisation to economic growth he will also be aware that question remain about how much additional support public sector organisation will receive to cover the additional cost of employer national insurance contribution do the secretary of state expect or anticipate those employer to be compensate in full for those additional cost the hon gentleman raise legitimate point that be considerably outside the remit of the department for business and trade he be right to put that issue on the record there will be opportunity for clarity in that space understand why for his constituent he will want to ask that question in the budget debate as member intervention have show the budget be not just about set of policy that will be to the advantage of large business they will also be important to our small start up and small and medium sized enterprise as well as for our old big family firm we have commit to hardwire the view of small business into everything we do and we have already start to do that that be why in september together with the federation of small businesses we announce robust measure to tackle late payment with new fair payment code and tough new rule on company report at the same time we be reform the british business bank to free up precious capital for sme to expand to create new job and to take idea from design to development the chancellor budget give the green light to my department to invest over billion over the next two year so that the british business bank can widen access to finance for small business across the country that include over million each year for small business loan programme like our start up loan and the growth guarantee scheme as hon member will know and have ask about during the debate while we be raise national insurance contribution we have mitigate the impact for small business by double the employment allowance to that mean million small business will either be pay the same or less in national insurance contribution than they do now that be why the federation of small businesses have say that the budget show clear direction in business policy now for the whole of this parliament to target support at small business prioritise everyday entrepreneur work in local community in all part of the country through this new support for sme the stability afford by our new industrial strategy and the resetting of our trade relation we be show unequivocally that the uk support business want to partner with business and be open for business that pro worker pro business approach be already have significant impact last month hundred of the world big firm and investor from blackstone to the bw group haleon to holtec line up at our international investment summit to back britain and back this government growth mission that summit result in billion of private investment commitment more than double the amount secure by the previous government last year and in just day it will see billion of pound flow into our tech digital manufacturing and life science sector spur growth in all four nation of the united kingdom and create almost new job in the process we see something else at that business and international investment summit ringing endorsement of this government restoration of stability for the uk economy ifm investor say that it be very encourage by the new government commitment to long term pro investment mindset ørsted global leader in green energy state that the main reason it be invest more in the uk be because of our green energy target it recognise we as government who want work with business to enable the investment require go one step far it say the uk have clear national mission to drive economic growth and back wealth creation across every region of the country it welcome our effort to put the uk back on the investor map showcase market opportunity and reinforce how business and government can work in partnership let there be no doubt despite the dust the opposition be try to kick up this be budget with stability at its core which set course for growth and rebuild britain the former prime minister response baulk at the wave of new investment this budget usher but he could not be more wrong while we be restore economic stability and go for growth we be keep debt on downward path indeed on the back of the budget the imf have say that it support the reduction in the deficit over the medium term include by sustainably raise revenue it recognise what we on the government benches know to be true the principal way to drive economic growth be to invest invest and invest may remind the opposition that we have try their way all that do be stagnate wage stifle growth and put the public finance into billion black hole with nothing to show for it we can not cut our way out of hole we need investment to lift the economy up have endure the last government lurch from crisis to crisis the british people vote in july overwhelmingly for change they vote for government that would set budgets to serve their long term interest not serve the news cycle or election cycle they vote for stability for growth and to fix the foundation that be exactly what this budget deliver and commend it to the house rise before call the next speaker wish to make short and hopefully helpful statement it be about the way in which member be call to speak in debate member who wish to catch my eye or indeed the eye of mr speaker himself or any of the other deputy speakers should write to mr speaker in advance those who have not write in may still be call but priority will be give to those who have apply in writing in advance member who have apply to speak but no long wish to do so should notify the speaker office as soon as possible once you have write in to request to speak you should turn up in the chamber for the start of the debate and for all contribution from the front bench you should be present in the chamber for most of the debate if you be not able to be here because of other commitment then you should withdraw your application to speak selection of speaker in debate be at the discretion of the chair the chair however can not predict precisely when member might expect to speak when very large number of member have put in to speak as we have see over the course of the entire budget debate it may not be possible to get you all in even with the use of time limit if for any reason you need to be briefly absent from the chamber during the debate in which you be down to speak you should notify the chair but prolonged absence may result in your name be remove from the list may ask members not to crowd the chair please to make request about when they be likely to be call please go through your whip it be very distracting and difficult for the chair particularly if there be large number of intervention and large number of member try to speak to please go through your whip who will be able to handle those request appropriately thank you madam deputy speaker may start by congratulate our us ally on the election of their president when it come to business and trade america be our most important partner as our economy be so interlinked nearly million brit work for american company and more than million americans work for british company that trade relationship be worth billion year and the amount invest in each other economy have now surpass trillion the government may be right to say that there be much to rebuild in britain today but what this budget do combine with the government nationalisation of railway employment rights bill and great british energy be to take we far away from that goal with high taxis more regulation big government and small wealth produce part of the economy it be budget for prejudice rather than for progress while labour member will praise the budget for its fine measure and the socialist purity of its design their constituent can see that when it come to growth the budget emperor have no clothe the office for budget responsibility strip it back to its stark naked flesh it say that budget policy temporarily boost output in the near term but leave gdp largely unchanged in five year if growth be their central mission the government have already fail in the harsh light of day the secretary of state colleague be start to realise that the budget be not such an appealing sell as be report on sunday labour back benchers have say that the chancellor budget be impossible to sell to horrified constituent they have be read their email again one colleague of the secretary of state for business and trade tell the daily telegraph it have be receive very badly indeed within the labour party there be stark contrast between what the obr be say and what those on the government front bench be claim the chance be that it will not be growth budget as be claim all the evidence be that it will have no more growth by the end of it and it will certainly be pay for by high effective taxis on work people the secretary of state colleague be right and no wonder the private sector experience of the cabinet could barely fill beer glass let alone boardroom conservative members know that it be business that create job and the prosperity to pay for our public service business be the builder and there be no rebuilding without they that be something that labour members simply do not understand britain business need government who have their back not one that drag they down under the previous government life expectancy plateaue and the number of people live with long term ill health increase be that good for business the ability to continue to invest in our public service and the sterling work do by the predecessor government on level up every part of the united government member do not like it but that work rely fundamentally on private enterprise which pay the taxis that fund the prosperity and the infrastructure that this country need be afraid that the hon gentleman be merely show once again his party deficient understanding of how modern economy work it be market not government that drive up prosperity and how free trade have improve human health do the shadow secretary of state think that the conservative design and implement brexit be good for market good for business and good for growth well we will talk little later about stability if colleague do not have maiden speech to make will be very happy to talk at great length about the many benefit of brexit and the important ability for country to make its own law and deliver benefit for the economy let make some progress the secretary of state have talk much about infrastructure and indeed that be partly the subject of today debate although create infrastructure be noble goal important to all the constituent who send we here word be afraid be cheap and the action of his party somewhat undermine his position his party vote in the other place against measure to allow home to be build and his labour mayor of london fail to build to such an extent that the secretary of state for housing communities and local government now propose lower his target this labour budget have pull up the housing ladder for so many by increase the burden of stamp duty for first time buyer currently an estimate of first time buyer pay no stamp duty but from april that could fall to only half rise will happily give way to the hon lady particularly if she can tell how this budget will help deliver for first time buyer do the shadow secretary of state agree that this labour government will help renter by ban no fault eviction be party to the debate in which my right hon friend the leader of the opposition talk about the unintended consequence of pile burden upon burden on the rental market in well mean way accept we have only to look north of the border where similar measure be introduce to see their devastating effect on the rental market and the shocking increase in rent as result of government try to over regulate sector laughably while the government talk about investment in their first day they cancel the restore your railway programme clearly with some project be honourable exception which would have make it easy for constituent to get to work sustainably they have also cancel road scheme include the scheme and declare an interest the arundel bypass in my constituency it be not the first time that labour government have cancel that bypass the government talk great deal about the future of this country the technology and their modern industrial strategy but should not new innovative technology such as artificial intelligence and supercomputing be at the heart of that rise will happily give way to the secretary of state if he want to explain why he no long deem it important to invest in these crucial part of the economy let we reflect on where we be today the first day of the constructive opposition the new leader of the conservative party stand at the dispatch box two hour ago and call for both tax cut and massive public spending on defence how be you go to pay for project that you promise but never deliver and that you know you could never pay for order the secretary of state know well than to say you we would have get well answer from chatgpt the reality be that the budget not only increase taxis in the outyear by billion year but increase borrowing by billion over the course of the plan yet despite that largesse there be no room to fulfil the mandate of british researcher and continue to invest in the supercomputer and infrastructure that they need business secretary in the last government write an industrial strategy but it be quickly bin under the conservatives new leadership what be their position on industrial strategy because we go without one for many year forgive if the hon member have be here for more than day but fully support the sector and the industrial strategy that the government have articulate for they because the strategy continue on from and be identical to those of the previous government not for the first time we see what call name plat from this government british business bank the uk infrastructure bank be be re name plat as national wealth fund the modern industrial strategy take the exist science technology and innovation framework our plan for financial service and our creative industry strategy and re name plat they under different banner that be welcome there be nothing quite as flattering as plagiarism and be delighted that those really important sector of the economy will benefit from degree of continuity the budget have be absolutely crush for business if the secretary of state be honest he will know that from his engagement the only thing that it have deliver to business across the country be more burden accord to the institute for fiscal studies the increase in national insurance contribution amount to billion tax on business the reduction of the national insurance threshold by over will keep small and medium sized business up at night let we not equivocate the measure in the budget amount in the word of the chancellor herself to job tax from industry leader to shop owner those in the retail hospitality and leisure industry in particular will think back to what they hear during the election campaign know that my hon friend follow these thing closely accord to the obr the billion job tax bombshell actually net only billion because of reduced investment and other fund and three quarter of the billion fall on worker wage only this socialist government could be so incompetent as to reduce wage by more than they will take from tax that they have introduce have not hear that observation yet in the debate but share it with my hon friend my right hon friend be exactly right we have hear talk from labour members of circular economy well this be entirely circular as the obr observe the measure do not add to growth and as my right hon friend mention three quarter of the burden will fall on the low pay the labour party have distinguished record on these matter and if labour member be serious and thoughtful about this they will interrogate their front benchers in much great depth because the measure will result in lower pay poor job and it will be much hard for people to get on the job ladder in the first place there be an enormous number of unanswered question the impact on gps be uncoste and on charity indeed there will be an impact on charity and the third sector those who care for we at the most difficult point in life on friday meet representative from charity in my constituency that care for those with dementia its income be fix its need be ever present and as result of this labour budget it simply do not know how it will balance its book be the reality not that the labour government also do not know how they will balance the book ask the secretary of state for health and social care in write parliamentary question how much the rise in employer national insurance contribution will cost the department the government say that they do not know either the government do not know but should know or they do know and should say the budget also include the high ever increase in capital gain tax and reduction in business property relief just as with the family farm tax that reduction be an attack on the family own business that dominate our high street and industrial park the incentive to take risk and to create and grow family business with the objective of pass it on will be fundamentally undermine some of uk business be family run and in aggregate they employ of all worker in the economy we be talk about decade of hard work dedicate to build legacy and people create an insurance policy for their passing the so call loophole in inheritance tax that government front benchers talk about be legitimate tax policy introduce by labour government in to ensure that business be not break up and devastate on the death of an owner to the detriment of the remain employee worker supplier customer the wide economy and even the treasury which would lose future tax take this measure could be devastating for our community and our high street up and down the country it be not just conservative members who be sound the alarm though we may be do it with great degree of passion the chief executive officer of ukhospitality say that the increase in national insurance will undermine business operate at the margin and be brake on growth family business uk which represent family own enterprise have say that the budget remove entirely any incentive for start or run family business the hon gentleman will recall that in the spring budget the conservative party increase national insurance for employer by and he support that can he explain why he be in favour of it then but oppose it now even though we have introduce increase employment allowance that counteract the change be pretty sure that at the time the now chancellor describe the increase as job tax and that be exactly what this be what we be see be not need to balance the nation book on the back of global supply chain squeeze high energy cost due to the war in ukraine and the aftermath of covid but government come in with premeditate plan that they do not share with the british people and set the big ever tax raid budget in british history that be an enormous difference and business understand it it can see through this government one of the uk lead hospitality entrepreneur be luke johnson who run gail which believe some of my liberal democrat colleague be rather keen on they be the party of gail he say it be heartbreake that britain proud record of innovation flexibility and business success be be throw away thank to that old knee jerk labour instinct of tax success agree it be clear that the hon gentleman disagree with the way in which the budget raise revenue do he oppose the billion investment in the nhs the investment in special educational need and disability education or the increase in the school budget hope that the hon gentleman have long and successful career in this house but he will not have very long to wait if he be concerned about lack of investment in the nhs ask he to sit down with the chief secretary to the treasury and ask exactly what the rate of growth will be for nhs spending and departmental spending in the year and then perhaps he could come back and tell what he think about that level of spending growth the government talk of stabilise the economy we have hear lot about that but this be not budget for stability it be anything but let educate labour colleague there be nothing stable about lower the rate of economic growth all that do be create more fragile and susceptible economy there be nothing sustainable about government change the fiscal rule after say that they would not even with the potentially unsustainable level of departmental spend there be nothing stable in government have razor thin level of headroom that the obr quantifie at only billion just one third of the level that the chancellor predecessor set to ensure that they remain within the fiscal rule which they have just make up by the way will the hon gentleman give way will happily give way to the hon lady if she want to talk about headroom in the fiscal rule and the lack thereof the hon gentleman be talk about stability but do he recognise the irony in his party the party of liz truss lecture the government about stability be try to find something relevant to say to the hon lady there be rise behind you will happily give way in minute at least the budget that the hon lady talk about be an attempt to do two thing first it seek to shield household in this country from go into cold winter with an increase in energy bill her labour colleague may wish to contemplate what they have do to million pensioner through the reduction of the winter fuel allowance secondly it be budget for growth this budget as we have well some people be make interesting comment but the direction in this budget be to low rather than increase growth do my hon friend agree that in the reaction to the budget the gilt market be in far bad position than it be follow the mini budget labour members might want to do some research into the impact of their own budget well order will hear the shadow secretary of state my hon friend make exactly the right point the government be enormously lucky give the spike in gilt yield over the precede week and subsequent to the budget that the previous government deal with the aftermath of the financial regulatory failure in respect of liability drive investment we deal with that and as result we have more stable financial system which have be able so far to survive what the government have do in evidence take by the treasury committee yesterday richard hughes explain and shall say this slowly that an increase to interest rate of just third of wipe out all the headroom that be in the obr economic and fiscal outlook and be no doubt why the obr give the government only chance of hit their target that be barely well than the odd on coin toss so there we have it the government spend month talk up their credential on enterprise they look business owner in the eye and tell they that they would have their back and support they but day later they go back on their promise prawn cocktail offensive with nasty dose of indigestion they have crush confidence and destroy investment they have check any incentive for growth they have leave thousand of enterprise striver wonder when the day will come when the shutter on their shop be not lift any more dare the secretary of state to stand before the million family business owner and tell they that this be budget that will work for they risk taker and wealth creator deserve government who have their back invest in infrastructure and do not embolden the inefficiency of the public sector be in no doubt while the government keep growth innovation and entrepreneur in their crosshair the conservatives will always be on the side of business be delighted to speak about the first labour budget in year for my constituent the last fourteen year have be difficult too often they feel that the then government be not on their side that government do not hear that austerity leave we not only with deteriorate public service but more fragile community they do not reform the planning system which would have alleviate the housing crisis and stop the to rent increase that leave many of my constituent face eviction during cost of living crisis they do not take the difficult decision to protect the economy and leave our new government with black hole to fill we hear loud and clear in july that government must be different this budget offer that we have rise to the national living wage and to the rate for which will make work pay whatever someone age funding of over billion for the nhs over the next two year will deliver more doctor and ten of thousand of extra appointment help hospital such as st thomas just over the river in my constituency as the chair of the housing communities and local government committee have hear lot from our local authority which have bear the brunt of the failure to tackle the housing crisis council have be forget with devastating consequence for community yesterday at our first public committee meeting we hear from homelessness organisation and local authority representative on the state of temporary accommodation council be have to spend unsustainable amount to fill gap in that area which be drive they to near bankruptcy in london alone of local authority housing budget be be absorb by temporary accommodation that mean less money for repair and maintenance of housing stock which leave tenant feel the increase in the crisis the human impact be even more shocking as speak over child be in temporary accommodation across england in the last five year child have die in circumstance link to temporary accommodation of they be under the age of one that should shock and shame we those death be not coincidental yesterday the committee hear about family live in one room that can stunt child growth because they be not able to do the thing they should such as crawl we hear about how child ability to form social attachment with peer can be affect by the lack of consistency cause by constant moving we hear about how parent be often plunge into mental health crisis because of the stress of raise family in those condition which far isolate the child the government can and must do well welcome the step in this budget to supplement the affordable housing programme increase homelessness spending and scale back right to buy to boost our social housing stock but they must be first step we need far significant change in the upcoming funding settlement and the next budget must truly start to address that crisis be particularly worried about the freeze to local housing allowance rate because it be lifeline for people who be struggle that be cover by the department for work and pensions but the measure could have significant impact on attempt to tackle the homelessness crisis so it must be address in upcoming statement the deep harm cause by the last year can not and will not be fix overnight the budget be the first in my five year in this house that give we glimmer of hope and road map for fix our break public service congratulate the chancellor and her team on get on with the job so quickly but will be voice for the thousand of family who continue to fall through the crack with no safety net beneath they they can not afford to wait any long for help they need it now urge the government to give attention to people in crisis such as those in temporary accommodation we can not as labour government risk fail generation of young people call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be pleasure to follow the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi who have give another customarily powerful speech and remind we of the injustice face those who fall between the crack we live in an uncertain and unstable world and the us election result make it more so as we debate how to rebuild our great country after the mess leave by the conservatives many of we will have sense of apprehension today about what the presidential result mean for the us include woman and minority group as well as for the uk europe and the world family across the uk will also be worry about the damage that president trump and his administration may do to our economy and our national security give his record of start trade war undermine nato and embolden tyrant such as putin none the less that may well be the context within which we must rebuild britain we liberal democrats believe that rebuild britain start with rebuild our nhs and social care never before have hear so much desperation as at the last general election the legacy of the last government be to leave people say that they could not see gp or dentist and be wait month for mental health assessment or special educational need document people be ask on the doorstep whether maybe everything be so broken that it could not be fix at all but we liberal democrats know that health and social care must be fix hand in hand we welcome the government investment in the nhs but they can not remain silent on social care they can not dismiss it as second term issue business know that people productivity plummet when they have to pick up the piece of broken social care system the hon lady make absolutely the right point about the nhs and its interdependence with social care but the government have do more than be silent on social care through the minimum wage and the nic they have impose billion of additional cost on social care while give just million to local authority they be take an already difficult situation and make it rather bad thank the right hon gentleman for make that point he may remember that at deputy prime minister question two week ago raise precisely that point with the deputy prime minister and advise the government that if they go ahead with the rise in national insurance contribution it would affect social care the right hon gentleman will however remember that it be the conservative prime minister boris johnson who stand on the step of downing street in and promise to reform social care once and for all but clearly fail to do so two manage partner from gp practice in my constituency have write to about the significant impact of the increase in employer ni contribution which they say will directly undermine access and patient care they will also have huge impact on the brilliant work of princess alice hospice in my constituency which be already hugely stretch it will cost that hospice year do my hon friend agree that that hospice and those gp practice should be exempt thank my hon friend for that excellent intervention absolutely agree that they should be exempt think the rise in national insurance contribution be the wrong thing to do full stop but if it be go to go ahead there must be exemption in my own area for example one local hospice in hertfordshire will see its national insurance contribution go up by its warning be very clear that if this rise go ahead bed will have to close people must see opportunity in enterprise as well but the rise in national insurance contribution will hit small business hard especially those on the high street the success of our high street really matter not just for growth but for confidence for so many people the high street be the most visual and visceral mark of whether or not the economy be thrive would be grateful if the minister could indicate later today whether the government intend to bring forward high street strategy and if so when we might see it have be inundate with message from small business on my high street in st albans here be just some of the quote one business say that the reality of last week budget will mean no more investment and no further recruitment as be plan and in all likelihood redundancy another small business say provide employment locally raise money for local charity and have create much love addition to our town centre be worried about how much long can go on one business say that it would be impact mainly with our business rate increase and my plea be that that can happen the high street challenge be hard enough as they be without have to face an uncertain christmas trading period other colleague have mention the impact on medical charity hospice and gps in hertfordshire the local medical committee say since we have see practice close or merge across bedfordshire and hertfordshire represent of the practice that exist back in gp practice need certainty as to whether any of these cost will be pass on to they at time when they be already feel the squeeze can guess what the minister may say he may encourage member on the opposition benches to indicate how we would raise taxis instead in the spirit of constructive opposition we liberal democrats urge the government to think again because we believe the burden of fix our public service should fall on the shoulder of the big bank the gambling company and the big tech company not the small business that be the beat heart of our community suppress small business be not the route to growth the business rate reform in the budget not only fall short of what we need but actually make thing bad in the short term the last conservative government promise to reform the business rate system but fail to do so the current system penalise brick and mortar retailer while out of town retailer manage to get off almost free pub high street shop and the rest of the hospitality sector have be hit really hard with the discount be reduce from to that be go to have major impact st albans be renowned for its pub as many of the more long establish member will remember talk about the pub in st albans on many occasion we have more pub per square mile than anywhere else in the uk but those pub will now face additional business rate bill of between and some fear that this could push they over the edge over the past few day much have be say about food security as well we liberal democrats agree that the loophole that be be exploit by big corporation that buy up swathe of our land must be close but we be concerned that the government approach be rather crude that as they try to close those loophole some family farm will be collateral damage again in the spirit of constructive opposition encourage the government to look again at our proposal for proper family farming test as be use in some other country finally will say word or two about investment we liberal democrats believe that the government have do the right thing in change the fiscal rule and in principle we believe in the importance of borrow for productive investment however once again say this in the spirit of constructive opposition think the government have put all of their growth egg in the building back basket understand why they may be do that however give the trump presidency and the prospect of potential tariff and trade war that could drive up the price of product such as semiconductor and construction material there be very real risk that the investment that the government make will not reap the reward that we all hope for through change in the global climate rather than any fault of their own we need resilient economy so praise the government for investing but urge they to look at the question of resilience at this time it be even more important that we look to small business and high street for growth so urge the government to think again and unleash the power of our high street and small business rather than hamper they call irene campbell to make her maiden speech many thank madam deputy speaker for call to give my maiden speech in such an important debate it be great to see budget deliver by female chancellor the first one ever in this parliament and budget deliver the large funding settlement for scotland in the history of devolution be delighted to be here today as the member of parliament for

parliament be to bring improvement and investment and to work hard to make positive change to the life of people in north ayrshire and arran start by congratulate my hon friend the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith on his role as shadow secretary of state know what distinguished career he have have in business and how eminently qualified he be for this role also enjoy listen to the secretary of state know he be very intelligent man and know by reputation what decent man he be but while be sit in the chamber look up on wikipedia what his business experience be and what qualify he for his role be sorry to report that he have about as much business experience as do which be precisely none spend my career before my election work in parliament and in the charity sector you could mistake for labour mp madam deputy speaker be almost indistinguishable from they and easily mistaken for one however will do my good to disabuse they of that false impression by say what very shameful thing it be that the labour party allow the public to be so mislead in the run up to the last election labour promise not to raise taxis not to increase borrowing or to change the borrowing rule and certainly not to impose inheritance tax on family farm all those thing they have do in this budget and it be shameful thing leave aside whether these measure be good or bad for the country leave aside the erroneous idea that suddenly labour understand the public finance after they get into government when they do not understand they before even though before the party get into government it say it know exactly what be in the public finance and of course it do because that be what the obr enable the fact be that labour understandably stress in the run up to the election that they be stand on platform of probity integrity and trust those be the word use repeatedly in their election campaign and the public respond to that in so far as it be possible to say that labour win public support at the election of course it do not really we just lose it it be on the ground labour member ask why we lose it we lose it because the public could not trust we and they do not think we have integrity know that be not stupid we understand what the public thought and be not go to disabuse they but labour promise to be different and in this budget they have absolutely break their promise on integrity and trust this be day of shame for the party after what they have do with this budget in less partisan spirit there be much to critique about the economy that the labour party inherit when it come into government recognise that there be thing wrong with our economy and deep structural problem they go back decade lot long than year in so far as it be possible to critique the conservative party for failure those happen for very understandable reason not least because of the deficit and the broken economy that we have inherit year previously as well as other event that take place during our time in power our failure be that we do not fix those fundamental structural problem with the economy that we inherit those problem be to do with high tax high borrow economy that have high level of public debt cause by high welfare high and preventable health spending high rate of private debt low productivity and low wage those be the underlie structural reality of the british economy go back decade they be the reality of this century so far it be therefore right that the chancellor talk often about fix the foundation welcome that because it be absolutely the right framework within which to approach the challenge that the new government face on the economy the problem be that the government be lean into the broken model that we have they be far damage the foundation of our economy which need to be fix by pursue more borrowing more tax and spend and as my hon friend the member for arundel and south downs say from the front bench little while ago plan that will not lead to great growth in the economy over this parliament with only minuscule improvement if the forecast be correct nevertheless in the spirit of cross party consensus let hope that we can fix the foundation of the economy because we do need to fix they what be those foundation classically understand the foundation of prosperity the foundation of any economy be land labour and capital let look at each briefly in turn the fundamental reality of our land economy be the planning system work do in the think tank world by southwood hughes and bowman call foundations that be absolutely the right framing show that it be impossible to build thing in this country to build they quickly and to build they in the right place yes we need new housing urgently and recognise and applaud the government commitment on that but their approach be entirely wrong they propose to build house where they be not need and not want on our green field instead of where they be urgently need and very much want which be in our city what we need all across the country include in rural area such as the one represent in east wiltshire be more business space we need space for industrial use and we need office space we urgently need to enable our entrepreneur to create business and to grow they in the place where they want to do that be very conscious of the challenge we have in wiltshire with the lack of affordable and available land for business like other should also quickly mention the absolute crime of propose to tax family farm and to insist that farmer sell up when farm be pass from one generation to the next that be another flagrant abuse of trust by this government the second foundation be the labour market have not hear the government address this so far in the budget or in this budget debate but the crucial challenge for our economy be that it be so dependent on high rate of low skilled migration which depress wage increase welfare and inhibit productivity crucially because it disincentivise employer from invest in people in machinery or in technology that boost growth and productivity we have to cap migration and shift spending into the skill economy and into our own people to support they to gain the skill they need in order to do the job that need do the third foundation be capital itself we have hear lot from ministers about the need for investment but what they mean be public investment and public spending what be fundamentally need be private investment but we hear nothing about that and do not see much sign of it we have break capital market again recognise that lot of this go back many year to well before this government but it be difficult for business to find the capital they need to start and crucially to scale all the incentive be towards rush to private equity or to an initial public offering and cash out as soon as possible we hear from my hon friend the member for mid norfolk george freeman during prime minister question early about the failure of the london capital market to direct capital into uk business that be perennial challenge with our finance sector and it need address echo the point make by the liberal democrat spokesman the hon member for st albans daisy cooper who be absolutely right about the importance of invest in uk resilience we need money crucially private money to go into small and medium sized enterprise and the key growth sector that will be need in the turbulent time to come we need to use the incentive in the tax and regulation system to direct finance towards british business crucially we also need to make british business more competitive that bring to the national insurance increase this huge job tax have be impose on the country with no warning and in fact in direct breach of promise make by the labour party as business owner who be pleased to see more money in the pocket of not just my team but my customer can ask the hon member whether he agree that the conservatives be very good with their own money but absolutely appalling with the country finance be delighted to hear that there be in fact businessman on the labour benches that be tremendous and hope that he and his business prosper under the government that he be support the fact be that the obr itself say in its commentary on the budget that payroll tax rise be pass through into low wage the direct effect be that the government be tax worker to fund their spending commitment those spending commitment go partly towards what they call investment capital project but also towards public service run cost as we have hear today the bulk of that money will be front load at the start of this parliament in what one would have think be direct contravention of good fiscal management however more importantly and more worryingly as we hear the effect will be largely circular because the additional spending will simply be take in tax through the nic increase on behalf of my constituent would quickly add that the one spending area where have particular regret be the cutting of the transport budget the government talk about increase investment in the public sector but they have cut

attack student with monumental hike in tuition fee tax on aspiration and on young people and their hard work family as the week have go by we have see the budget unravel as manifesto promise after promise have be break have constituent from pensioner and farmer to business charity community organisation gps and many more come to with anxiety and worry my local farmer be devastate promise make to they have be break with no consultation give they no opportunity to plan the government have show that they be no friend of the farmer the producer of our food and the guardian of our countryside farmer have go from food hero during covid to be abandon in the cold the government seem to have fail to grasp that family farm be not only farm they be much more family farmer invest in their business for the long term for the next generation the government need to keep their promise reverse the change to agricultural property relief and business property relief and abolish what and other now term the family farm tax think it be thomas jefferson who say that honesty be the first chapter in the book of wisdom do my right hon friend agree that the way that this government be serially break all the promise they make during the election be corrosive for our politic absolutely small business also face tax on aspiration and entrepreneurship inheritance tax will be the death of enterprise the increase to employer national insurance and the minimum wage will stymie growth and investment inflation look set to be high than growth under the chancellor measure in fact far from this be budget for growth the measure set out by the chancellor will be hindrance if we put all this together who do it hit work people even the chief secretary to the treasury admit that on tv think too of the job for work people that will be lose or never even create thank to the budget of broken promise this be budget that punish pensioner destroy our countryside chase after our motorist deny work family and their child choice over education and saddle young people with more student debt it be budget about ever increase spending ever high taxis and an ever expand state prosperity have never be the result of the state hand out more taxpayer money it have come from empower business entrepreneur and family and it be about enable opportunity once upon time labour would have be think of as the party of work people but not now far from fix the foundation it be dig an even big hole what privilege it be to follow so many accomplished and particularly move maiden speech start by congratulate my right hon friend the chancellor on her first budget it show the first step of this new labour government as the work of change really begin hope that it will mark turning point from decline to investment from instability to security and from self interest to public service the choice make in the budget certainly turn the page on the last year they begin to restore our public service and improve the right and reward of low and middle income earner in the short time that have want to touch on three area of particular concern to my constituent first welcome the billion plus of investment to get our national health service back on its foot cut waiting time and deliver extra elective appointment week that move will give real hope to people worry about their healthcare it recognise our nhs staff across the service such as those at aintree university hospital in my constituency and in specialist facility like the walton centre will the hon member give way will not also welcome the intention to shift the focus to prevention in healthcare my constituency be one of the most deprived in the uk and far too many suffer the health impact of poverty addiction and despair hope to work with the government to address those long term public health crisis next and crucially the budget deliver some long overdue justice and fairness for those who have be fail by the state it will transfer the investment reserve fund in the mineworker pension scheme to its member and will fund compensation scheme for the victim of the post office horizon scandal and the infected blood scandal include number of my constituent it give hope that the government have show commendable will to right historical wrong hope that in the month and year ahead the chancellor will also consider the claim of the women against state pension inequality woman bear in the include in my liverpool walton constituency finally want to mention the hospitality industry which be central to liverpool visitor economy the relief on business rate for retail hospitality and leisure be welcome but with cost continue to rise there remain climate of uncertainty for far too many local business we need to level the play field between brick and mortar business and the online global giant and we need to prioritise our high street and take the necessary step to give relief to local business call dame caroline dinenage you will know madam deputy speaker that the gosport constituency be community build around share history of service in and for our armed force thirteen per cent of my constituent be veteran those be good hard work people who have serve our country and ask for little in return but they be not wealthy people they be disproportionately impact by the budget which deliver the opposite of the growth we be promise it deliver taxis and cut that will leave my constituent disproportionately poorer it start with the baffling decision to cut winter fuel payment many of my constituent exist just outside the pension credit threshold and be hang on by their fingertip the government own datum suggest that of they will lose that lifeline through the cold winter month age uk say that it will be more than that which will be of pensioner in gosport have real concern for the health of old people in gosport during these winter month that concern extend to the future of some of our most important business the care home and nursery who do such vital work and employ so many of our constituent at this stage must direct the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests those organisation be seriously impact by the triple whammy of minimum wage increase employer national insurance threshold decrease and contribution increase hopscotch nursery in my constituency tell that the billion tax increase will impact business that employ high number of low wage worker it estimate that the change will add almost million in cost to their business that can not be alleviate by productivity increase or headcount reduction because childcare ratio be set by the government the service to which we entrust our most precious and loved family member rely on face to face care and human interaction so the extra cost face childcare and adult social care service will be bear by their customer work parent and the vulnerable elderly and by employee through low wage growth my hon friend be make powerful speech it be good to see the chief secretary to the treasury in his place hope he will take on board these argument and perhaps the overall settlement can be rework to minimise the negative impact that my hon friend outline agree would love to see something do to exempt the childcare and adult social care sector in particular from the policy the budget also threaten many organisation that be central to the regeneration of our community welcome the fact that the cliff edge for business rate relief for hospitality leisure and retail have be reduce but what the chancellor give with one hand she take away with the other because hospitality venue can now expect to see their cost increase by billion in my constituency that will potentially cripple business which employ around people while ministers talk about the value of our creative industry tourism and hospitality they be ignore their fragile state the chief executive officer of the sound and music charity have say that the measure will impose an extra million in additional taxis on the grassroots live music sector the music venue trust estimate that without additional support of remain venue will see their door close that be up to venue job and performance opportunity all lose as well as be budget of broken promise suspect that this will become know as budget of unintended consequence the decision that the chancellor have take will have real tangible impact on the community and those across the country not only that but we be saddle future generation with billion of pound of debt to pay for it let start by congratulate the member who have make their maiden speech this afternoon my hon friend the members for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell for stoke on trent north david williams for sherwood forest michelle welsh and for ely and east cambridgeshire charlotte cane make the first of many brilliant be sure contribution to this house it be pleasure to speak in today debate in support of the budget present last week it be historic the first deliver by labour chancellor in year the first deliver by female chancellor and just as importantly the first deliver by chancellor who go to school in beckenham and penge on behalf of everyone in beckenham and penge congratulate the chancellor and look forward to take sign copy of the budget to her old school in penge very soon two fun fact about my constituency be that we have the second big percentage of rail commuter in britain and the most train station of any constituency we be constituency of commuter and the vast majority who board train every morning go to work in private sector job across london know that life well as it be exactly what do before be elect as the mp for my constituency this year criticism level by opposition members be that labour member do not understand business that be simply not true for the decade before be elect work in the private sector first at pwc on the graduate scheme and later for two big tech firm the private sector add so much value to our country and be passionate advocate of it private sector company be an engine for innovation they contribute to the economy help we pay for vital public service and provide high skilled well pay job the sort of job that thousand of people in my constituency do and want their child to do in the future in order for business to plan and invest economic and political stability be vital and business have be starve of that in recent year we have have six chancellor in just over three year and sharp cut follow by serious increase and then far plan cut corporation tax go from to and then to they say that they be go to build key infrastructure then they pause it rename it announce it again but could not tell we how they be go to fund it they tell we that brexit would solve all our problem but make disaster of that too this budget like this government in sharp contrast to the one before be serious about provide the economic and political stability that businesse in our country need to invest and grow be delighted to see investment in vital infrastructure include transport for london infrastructure and new co operative approach to work between my good friend the transport secretary and our excellent mayor of london sadiq khan have no doubt that that will be of great benefit to my constituent include the thousand who commute across london each day and the business for which they work and look forward to support it later this be budget of the public sector by the public sector for the public sector neither the chancellor nor the prime minister be able to define work person with any clarity in various confused and stumble attempt do the definition include the entrepreneur who take risk invest money employ work people work hard themselves and collect vat national insurance and pension contribution which they gift wrap and pay to the state as well as pay corporation tax on any residual profit if not why not however we can now see that that be irrelevant as the massive increase in employer national insurance contribution and the equally venal cut in the payment threshold from to be huge tax on employment in the private sector which unlike the state can not print money in taxpayer collective name to cover any budget shortfall this will mean that the private sector will employ few people by design and will reduce pay rise increase price invest less and pay less corporation tax it be disaster for government to hand out taxpayer money like confetti without proper check and balance take hard work taxpayer for fool this budget be only possible because quantitative easing have allow the state to grow without justification nurture the culture of central planning misguide net zero obsession and all the element of collectivism that take generation to destroy the soviet union the chancellor have land knockout punch on private sector entrepreneur it be not only small business that suffer the farming industry already in parlous state have be far undermine by revise death tax amendment if rethink of this lunacy be not forthcoming the continuity and long term investment require to provide this over populate island with degree of food security will be destroy by force sale of land on death farming be tough vocational career and the average age of farmer be now over the same be true for family business which be also set to suffer disruptive death taxis the backbone of britain nation of shopkeeper be be break by socialist design as winston churchill presciently observe contend that for nation to try to tax itself into prosperity be like man stand in bucket and try to lift himself up by the handle thank the hon member for great yarmouth rupert lowe for his speech but he should know well because one of his relative use to be doctor in my village in the cotwolds and the rest of the country have wait for this budget for year have work as gp throughout that time and have watch with horror as our nhs have go from be the good health service in the world as it be in to be service on its knee for year have watch the gap between rich and poor grow wide and wide for year have watch the fabric of our school and the nhs fall apart therefore welcome this budget it be budget that lift the curse of low pay and invest in the special educational need of our child it be the budget that will finally compensate those who have be wrong by the infected blood scandal it be budget that will rebuild britain lift people out of low pay and make our country more equal be probably the most effective way of prevent ill health and make our population healthier so what really welcome in this budget be the huge amount of funding for the nhs the big amount in year with that funding though need to come reform and an increase in productivity and want to outline few little project on which we need to concentrate to increase our productivity on gp access dr tom sutherland of dursley practice have will the hon member join in express concern about the rise in national insurance contribution and the impact it will have on gp surgery include potential closure gps in my constituency have be ask about the impact understand that it will be mitigate through funding be not exactly sure how but have no that be because have not be inform but have no doubt that it will be cop with know that this government will rebuild general practice just as the conservative party trash it and break the back of it be not take any criticism from any of you about the nhs order please be seat you be not take any criticism from you say you please do not refer to colleague as you sorry do get rather angry there and shall not get angry any more let talk about gp access we need to get doctor not receptionist or to perform triage and we need to start think in different way we do not want protocol drive nhs what we need be genuine doctor patient relationship we also need to develop neighbourhood on point of order madam deputy speaker be it relevant point of order it be can the point of order not wait mr stuart no it be relevant here wonder whether it be in order for the hon gentleman to have be give assurance by the government that funding will be put in place to mitigate the impact on gps because that information have repeatedly be refuse to this house know madam deputy speaker that you represent all back benchers like in make sure the truth be out you can definitely raise that in your contribution later it be not point of order for the chair but no doubt the minister and front benchers have hear and can respond accordingly dr opher you will shortly run out of time so would be quick okay work in general practice for year there be always mitigation for tax change and have no doubt that the government will look after gps no doubt have no doubt would like to finish my speech if may we need to invest in neighbourhood health centre in suffolk dr tim reed be develop genuinely holistic service which will save money and increase productivity in mental health provision and among paramedic this be something that we need to explore much more spend hour with love one in bristol royal infirmary department and see the huge pressure that it be under notice that dr simon laing be use innovative way of go out with paramedic keep patient at home and work with paramedic in his department that be the type of adaptation we need in the nhs this budget begin the process of transform the nhs and will reward nhs staff up and down the country who continue to deliver excellent unscheduled care we must fix the foundation of care and use the new funding to ensure that more patient be care for at home difficult decision be be take but all of we on both side of the house want to see the nhs become the good in the world again and this budget start that process we know that growth come from invest in productivity and skill and too welcome the billion for the nhs long term public investment be essential for the security and stability that the uk need however we hear about the issue relate to employer ni contribution which will hit doctor dentist care home and local hospice add significant amount to their annual cost base per employee there be also pressure on voluntary community and social enterprise in my district teignbridge community and voluntary services tell that the sector employ some of the local population who be now all subject to the ni increase although it be well than nothing the business rate reduction from to will disappoint local retail hospitality and leisure business not forget the inheritance tax threat to devon family farm there be nothing in this budget for social care for devon crumble hospital or for devon essential transport bank share be soar follow this budget do my hon friend agree that the liberal democrat proposal to reverse the conservative government cut to the big bank levy raise around billion year would mean that we would not need the gp tax the family farm tax or the winter fuel cut and that we could fund upgrade to the treliske derriford and north devon hospital order this be too long an intervention my hon friend be absolutely right there be other way that this money could have be find the liberal democrats have long be say that we should be look to the bank the big oil company and the big international tech company to pay their fair share and that be where money should be seek there be nothing in the budget for devon essential transport last year pothole fund be drop in the ocean accord to devon county council and the increase in this budget still leave big hole not even mention in the budget be the completion of the dawlish rail resilience project which be key to connect the south west without funding the design team will soon be redeploy and all the progress to date will be lose this project will cost million more if it be not do now and urge the minister to meet we to get it fund growth in the economy in devon and cornwall be heavily dependent on fast reliable train service and we see what happen with dawlish the budget also mention housing and local government until july be leader of my district council and be proud that the lib dem administration start build council home the first in year they be cheap to rent and cheap to heat because they be well insulate and power by air source heat pump and solar power additional capital for social home be welcome but the frozen local housing allowance hamper housing association that have already scale back their plan for development and commercial developer will still try to cut affordable home from section responsibility the budget also offer new planning officer but those be spread very thinly over the planning authority newton abbot social housing need have increase by in my constituency like in ely the average house price be time the average earning and rent have soar the broken housing market be fail newton abbot and the propose change to the planning rule be insufficient to fix it home be unreachable for too many family people be be deny the right to safe and secure place to call home welcome the multi year settlement for council and the removal of the hunger bidding for grant involve huge amount of waste effort write bid and unachievable timeframe we can not let that centralised control continue we need real devolution but devolution be not just reorganisation order call rosie wrighting like many of my hon friend have spend my career in business specifically in retail head office so be proud to be part of government that be pro business and pro worker the last time labour government deliver budget in this house be year old that labour government look after our public service focus on cut crime be ambitious about our education and invest in our nhs it be because of those decision that have the opportunity that do and that be stand in this house today since then those priority have be forget and our constituent have have to bear the brunt people in my constituency of kettering know all too well the price they have pay for the last year of tory failure crumble hospital and school rise crime and crisis in send work people in this country have not have government who have work for they for year it be shameful that the previous conservative government promise funding that simply do not exist they let our community think that they be go to receive money know that it be not there and that it would be someone else problem after the election we now finally have labour government and truly labour budget that prioritise work people it be incredible to be the young woman in the house today but it be even more incredible to have watch the first female chancellor deliver the first labour budget in year it show and many young woman that there be no limit to our ambition regardless of what the leader of the opposition think this be glass ceiling shatter there be some hugely important measure in this budget for the people of kettering our public service deserve well than the treatment they have

to this budget we can give they hope that they will have an nhs fit for the future and country that invite investment without barrier to opportunity and in which work people be at the heart of everything we do call charlie maynard not present give the raid on family firm it be worth point out that the art of good budget and smart taxation be pluck the goose to get the maximum number of feather with the minimum amount of hiss on that basis be afraid this budget fail lamentably and it certainly do in my constituency the secretary of state for business and trade in his opening remark say that farm year will be affect by the budget change to agricultural property relief he say it casually as if it be acceptable well that be approximately one for every constituency and very much more in rural constituency the prospect of this affecting and potentially close two farm year in my constituency be frankly horrendous urge the government to think again agree with the government that it be legitimate to look at those who be land banking to avoid inheritance tax if that be their intention they will have support across the house but attack family farm be not on and hope the government will think again the government say that growth be their no priority how so in my constituency as we have hear the long await improvement have be can and suspect that the improvement will follow as the north south strategic study that be to be the prelude to westbury bypass look like it have be indefinitely delay my right hon friend be make characteristically excellent speech and he

hon friend be absolutely right government who be go for growth do not can big infrastructure project as the mercury drop the removal of the winter fuel allowance be become real worry to many of our rural constituent who live in old cold home many of which have no access to gas as we approach remembrance sunday the department for education in its wisdom have decide to remove funding for combined cadet force ccf have triple since and they be powerful engine for social mobility as be our armed force overall they give kid the confidence they need for small amount of money the withdrawal of funding be appalling as we all stand around our war memorial this sunday we will of course be admire our cadet it seem spiteful and vindictive that the government be remove their support the government need to go for growth but damage our farmer and our infrastructure particularly in rural area be not the way ahead urge they to think again be pleased to be able to speak in the debate on behalf of my constituent in exeter this budget be welcome break from year of policy uncertainty fiscal incompetence and austerity for our public service it start to put this country back on firm footing rebuild the foundation and invest in community and place like exeter exeter people have have tough few year the inflation they experience as high mortgage cost high rent high energy price and high food price be make bad by the last government catastrophic and incompetent financial management and yet we have no apology from the conservative benches exeter have huge potential as thriving economy indeed exeter be the economic driver of our region with gross value add of around billion pound it sit at the heart of travel to work area of over resident exeter be home to world class research lead university and we have good in class further education college and good secondary school we have the met office and the exeter science park and we be home to far cut edge research include one of the uk supercomputer however exeter have be hold back over recent year by tory government that have not invest in public service and our economy in the way we need to succeed that change with this budget be particularly pleased that this budget commit the uk to an budget of billion which will mean exeter and the uk remain at the forefront of scientific innovation from climate change to land management healthcare to biotechnology and beyond exeter be already hub for scientific research but we can do even more listen to my resident on the doorstep in the newtown area of exeter at the weekend who be really pleased about the investment in our nhs from long waiting list to our lack of nhs dentistry service and closure of community pharmacy my resident have be affect by the huge strain the nhs have find itself under in recent year be pleased that this new investment in the nhs budget will begin to fix our local nhs though people realise that will take time while the secondary school in exeter do not suffer from the awful raac crisis because every single one of they be rebuild under the last labour government know how important the new funding will be to school around the country invest in our education setting be important will be support the excellent exeter college as it seek to grow its campus to continue to deliver exceptional education to young people in exeter and across the south west have healthy well educate city with opportunity to work in the high tech sector of the future be vital to our future economic prosperity close by welcome that this be budget that recognise that reality and also recognise that the south west region and exeter in particular have huge potential and will play significant role in the growth of the uk economy in the future congratulate all those who make their maiden speech today this budget be herald as budget for rebuild britain so let we take close look at one or two aspect of that first as far as be concern the care sector be an integral part of our national health and wellbeing how will the additional employer national insurance cost affect that sector recently have the pleasure of visit the burnbank care home in buckie in my constituency one of care home run by ron taylor and his partner ron and his colleague pride themselves on the ethos of their home where personalised care be provide at the expense of large profit and where staff turnover be low and morale be high ron tell they come through the pandemic without single case of covid in their home how will the national insurance change help to rebuild the economy when ron and his partner must consider how they will find the substantial additional sum necessary to ensure the home continue to operate with the same wonderful care and humanity can there not be an exception make for this sector secondly let turn to farming food security be the bedrock of everything else we can not rebuild britain without food security recently during political discussion with my daughter ask she where do you think your food come from she say sainsbury just under year ago the then shadow secretary of state for the department for environment food and rural affairs state that the labour party have no intention to raise additional revenue through the agricultural property relief provision to reverse that decision after make an explicit promise not to do so be shameful and will put confidence in this government at an all time low after only four month that be quite an achievement thirdly let press the issue of rebuild public confidence the new government rightly prioritise sort out the infected blood and the post office scandal which be two important step in rebuild public confidence in our public service and in government generally but what of the waspi woman who be refer to by the hon member for liverpool walton dan carden there be no mention of they in the budget and no understanding that this be vital part of the process of rebuild public confidence in what we do in this place compensation be recommend six month ago by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman and call on the government and the minister to address that issue these woman deserve justice not just mean test justice no ifs no but just do it finally the people of scotland be leave wonder exactly how this budget bill as rebuild britain will actually work for they have many other question madam deputy speaker but will have to leave it there congratulate all hon member who have make their maiden speech today and who have speak so powerfully be very honoured to speak in this debate as it be budget that break the mould it break the mould with its delivery by britain first female chancellor of the exchequer it break the mould with its ambitious investment in industry and public service which speak to every part of the united kingdom and it break the mould of tory budgets and mini budgets which lumber the country with decline living standard painful lack of investment public service at break point and no economic growth to show for it the imperative for investment in service and industry have never be great my right hon friend the chancellor have respond to that challenge deliver budget that have ambition aspiration and fairness at its heart we be fix the foundation so that we can rebuild this country the priority of this labour government be growth growth for our economy for wage for living standard and for our public service this mean an uplift in the national living wage and the national minimum wage give wage boost to those on the low income there be record billion investment in the nhs which cover new elective appointment week and programme to modernise service and slash waiting time let be clear this additional funding have to make its way to frontline service in scotland where one in six scot be languish on waiting list we have also have massive increase in education funding but again the scottish government must make sure that this money make its way to our council budget we must also get the money into those school impact by the raac crisis such as st kentigern academy in blackburn where west lothian council have not receive one penny in financial support for the million partial rebuild of the school thank my hon friend for give way conservative members have say that they would like to see tax cut in the budget but do she agree that they have not spell out how they would pay for those tax cut and which public service and investment they would cut to pay for those cut my hon friend make good point investment must be pay for think that member across the house be very much aware of the desperate need for investment in our public service and in industry investment be require in social and affordable home across the uk to offer security and stability to more than one million people who have nowhere to call home again the scottish government must grasp the nettle here and deal with the housing emergency throughout scotland they have to deliver funding to the council and the register social landlord to bring down the shameful level of homelessness that we see right across the country my right hon friend the chancellor be deliver the large budget settlement for scotland in the history of devolution as have say this money must reach frontline service struggle family and local community no more excuse from the snp government for too long they have bungle scotland finance and under invest in public service with many service such as the nhs and council run service stretch to breaking point all while cry it wisnae and point to westminster no more at the election we say do send message to westminster send government and that be exactly what the people of scotland do the budget make good on labour commitment to deliver the change that the scottish people vote for change that deliver for scotland and every part of the uk congratulate all those who make their maiden speech today and congratulate president trump on his election while many of we in this house have legitimate concern about what his victory presage for democracy and the rule of law we should not undermine those value by criticise the american people for the choice that they have make it be consequential presidential election and this should have be consequential budget give the cost of living crisis record nhs waiting list crumble public service and decay infrastructure after year of broken promise by an out of touch conservative government people be desperate for fundamental change sadly the budget fail to deliver it there be aspect that my party and welcome particularly extra investment in our nhs although where be the structural change and reform of social care that be key to save our nhs more fundamentally despite the government talk the talk they have not walk the walk to grow our economy in fact much of what the chancellor announce last week will hold we back as the liberal democrat spokesperson for transport question whether the chancellor be serious about economic growth give that she have inflict real term cut to the transport budget our transport system should be the engine of our economy after year of neglect our infrastructure the time have come to make target investment that would make real difference to people life by initiate organic growth rather than the sugar rush of increased government spending which as the obr have show will dissipate in future year sadly the transport secretary previous promise of unprecedented funding have result in little more than recycle infrastructure announcement include some that have already be build and increase to bus and rail fare that will hit the poorest hard it be not just with regard to transport policy that the budget disappoint labour claim to be champion work people and growth but the increase in employer ni contribution be tax on job as it be when the tories do it it will put small business which should be in the vanguard of our growth strategy in jeopardy and as the ifs have say it will depress wage in the long run we all appreciate the mess that the government have inherit from the conservatives early today the prime minister say that his government make the economy the centrepiece of our budget however budget that damage the finance of family and business while stifle growth be not do what it say on the tin but rather kick the can down the road and do nothing to reset our economy by lay the foundation for genuine productive organic growth thank member for their maiden speech such warm and thoughtful contribution look forward to hear more from the member who speak today growth for high living standard be the define mission of this government and rightly so labour member know we have see it play out over the last year that there be link between the health of the national economy and the health of family finance up and down the country why have family in this country suffer in the last year it be because productivity growth have be on the floor have wage in this country continue to grow since the financial crisis at the rate they have before family would not be just or year well off on average worker would be well off have the conservative party grow the economy and our productivity so that family living standard could improve think particularly of young people and child and the economy that they will grow up in want people all over the country not just in chipping barnet but across the united kingdom to enter job market where good job be available in every place in election to come in five or year time want our politic to be define not by scarcity and fighting over limited resource because we have continue on the path of decline that the conservatives set we on but by abundance and there be enough maybe even more than enough for every family then child from whatever background particularly those from background like mine grow up in low income family in social housing and on free school meal can have the opportunity that they need this budget have do so much to help child and family like that we have change the fiscal rule so that we can invest again in our public service and infrastructure we be reform welfare so that we can support more people into work we be put money into affordable housing so that we can get to million new home we be invest in transport include northern powerhouse rail and here in london be confident that thank to those reform the office for budget responsibility which set out that it have not yet take account of many of the reform that the government be implement will be able to revise up those growth forecast so that as the chancellor say what we have achieve so far be not the summit of our ambition but only the beginning it be pleasure to take part in the debate we have hear fantastic maiden speech from across the house and be sure that we have all enjoy the insight from they it be pleasure to follow the hon member for chipping barnet dan tomlinson love the way he set out his aspiration for the kind of country of abundance that we should seek he be entirely right but be just not sure that this budget be the way to get there if the penny drop with he over time hope that he will be able to engage with we in come up with more constructive way of deliver the growth that this country need not only be this budget of broken promise but unfortunately and this be an important issue it be bad faith budget do not want to rehearse although there be so much to rehearse the promise not to raise taxis or the bogus billion that be not validate by the obr but those be serious point it be good to see the engagement from labour members because in politic one can not afford to have reputation for be dishonest and not do what one say interruption labour members who laugh at that should remember cicero advice he be always well at give advice than follow it but he say the foundation of justice be good faith that is truth and fidelity to promise and agreement without that we lose trust do the right hon gentleman think that the former member for uxbridge and south ruislip be honest at all time steve tuckwell be great man yes and with respect to the hon gentleman point think that the former prime minister and member for uxbridge and south ruislip be true to himself true to his heart and true in his expression although like all of we he probably have his moment what he never do be set out on deliberate path to mislead people he set out his honest view of the way the world should be unfortunately million people include of my constituent believe the promise of the now labour government and even members of parliament think that they be be honest thank my right hon friend for the speech that he be make do he agree that many of those people will now feel betrayed think people do feel betray we need to conduct our politic as honestly as we can the labour government break their promise not to raise taxis on work people because as the obr have make clear the nics raise will overwhelmingly fall on work people in fact if we go through the number as do it turn out that there be big reduction in wage than there be net receipt to the exchequer that be quite remarkable achievement probably only labour government could do that of course the government have also put up the cost of get on the bus if ever there be symbol of work people travel from my constituency to low pay job in hull that be it it will cost they year extra out of tax income do not know why the hon member for hitchin alistair strathern be grin know he grin lot but it should not be funny to he that someone in low wage job who travel into hull every day will pay year more because of the decision his government be make for couple it be year that cost be real and it should not be glossed over there be just one train station in my constituency and people who live in withernsea have no choice but to travel mile to get there the prime minister constituent be bless with pick and mix of way to get to the office the tube the overground train ubers bolt and even boris bike that be not the case in rural and coastal east yorkshire my constituent get the bus at in the morning and they get another bus at at night that be their lived reality and the serious impact of this budget should be recognise another broken promise be to pensioner who be tell that they would have security in retirement that their benefit would not be touch take from the very poor pensioner be not keep that promise interruption the very poor pensioner be those eligible for pension credit will the right hon gentleman give way will not the very poor pensioner be those eligible for pension credit and nearly of they will not get that that be the truth there be no point deny it finally there be the awful betrayal of british farmer many of whom work from dawn to dusk to ensure our supermarket be full of fresh fruit and veg accord to my constituent william hodgson who run small family farm near withernsea it be rural catastrophe ask the government to think again one thing that people in folkestone and hythe say on the doorstep during the general election be that public service particularly the nhs do not work any more be proud that the first labour budget in year have answer those call billion of pound will be invest in the uk public service that will be the start of long process of rebuild those service which be leave flat on their face after year of tory neglect it be interesting that in the minute after the budget folkestone and hythe conservatives be tweet at on social medium complain about high taxis and high borrowing that sound to like the arsonist criticise the fire service the chancellor be very open about what be require to start fix the foundation of our country and the question that the conservatives can not answer be what taxis they would have increase instead if they would have borrow less what public service would they have cut the truth be that after another five year of tory rule we would have see more austerity leave our public service to rot more hardship and literally more pain for the work people who have bear the brunt of year of austerity covid restriction and the rise cost of living be proud to be labour mp support labour government who choose not to go down that road fully accept that this budget involve hard choice but they be hard choice that be duck by the conservative party for year and year in addition to the headline from the budget which warmly welcome such as the billion for the nhs and raise the national minimum wage this budget have give hope to the hundred of constituent write to about whole range of matter include child with special educational need and disability in kent the tory run county council send provision be on its knee thank to labour budget there will now be billion of extra help to build an education system that can cater for every child need for people in rural area of my constituency such as romney marsh who have no or no proper access to broadband million will be allocate to help improve such service the budget increase in carer allowance will be welcome by the over carer in my constituency receive that allowance and the extra million in grant funding to local authority for social care be especially urgent in area such as mine where the population be old and more vulnerable also warmly welcome the billion of infrastructure investment over the next five year and will continue to make the case for investment in upgrade the rail freight infrastructure in kent particularly to maximise the use of the channel tunnel rail freight capacity congratulate those hon member who make their maiden speech in this debate their speech be touch and very inspirational the chancellor promise we that by make the necessary tough choice the autumn budget would provide the blueprint for unlock growth and prosperity yet struggle to see the substantive improvement that my constituent will experience to their life and for good reason many people in birmingham perry barr have never feel as poor as dishearten and as ignore as they do at this moment and it do not take much soul search to see why the budget do not deliver for the of pensioner in my constituency who be no long eligible for the winter fuel payment many of whom be now force to choose between keep warm feed themselves or incur an inordinate amount of debt the budget do not hear the plea of family in low income household some of child in birmingham perry barr live in poverty and child in my constituency alone live in household directly impact by the two child benefit cap yet despite the child poverty crisis unfold nationally this government refusal to remove that cruel measure have limit their ability to tackle the issue head on in the wake of the budget the safety net for our nation most vulnerable stakeholder be unable to support the weight of living the protection be brittle and hollow out this budget do not serve my constituent in birmingham perry barr nor do it ease the burden for birmingham million resident who continue to face indiscriminate cut to local government spending follow mismanagement birmingham city council which incidentally be labour run be essentially bankrupt necessary service such as transport for schoolchildren with special need adult social care youth centre and library be be cut and close the list be endless what be once far reach local government authority have be reduce to minimalist bare bone skeleton service while welcome the government slight increase in local government finance birmingham city council need significant amount of funding urge the government to consider increase local government finance it be great honour to speak in today budget debate this be the first labour budget in year deliver by the first female chancellor in year and it lay the foundation for local and national economic growth like many high street across the uk town centre in my constituency have face serious challenge over the year business have close unemployment have rise and crime have increase all sign of year of conservative under investment and neglect that have hurt not only our local economy but the very fabric of our community one thing we can all agree on be that we want our town centre to come back to life we want to restore the vibrancy that make our high street the heart of our community that be why will speak about the possibility that this new budget open for town such as leigh atherton golborne lowton and tyldesley town that have be fight back despite year of disinvestment we have see that target support can make real difference take leigh spinners mill my former place of work this community own co operative venture host more than business from start up to social enterprise all thrive right there in leigh those business have flourish with minimal investment prove that when we create the right condition such as affordable rent and reduce business rate local economy can thrive as much as we celebrate project such as the mill however the question remain how we bring the same success to our high street the government new business rate initiative be step in the right direction protect small business and encourage entrepreneurship support high street be not just about economic it be about revitalise the unique character of our community and create the independence need for business to grow be particularly encourage by the government commitment to the long term plan for town despite the billion black hole leave by the previous government that strategy align with labour manifesto priority reaffirm our commitment to build sustainable inclusive economy that benefit everybody in our community like everyone else would like to extend my congratulation to those who have make their maiden speech and to say what pleasure and honour it be to share the chamber with they refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests which detail my professional career as an optometrist provide nhs service and own small business this be my first budget just as it be for many other member in the chamber and have listen carefully to member dissect it and weigh up the detail as always the devil be in the detail as an nhs care worker welcome the increase in the nhs budget but be concern by the absence of specific measure to address the funding crisis in profession such as dentistry pharmacy and optometry all of which have important role to play in provide care to patient investment in such service will save million in the long run in my constituency there be real disparity in patient and gp number in fact it be the second large such disparity in the country for every gp there be patient that be untenable as result many people can not see their gp and that be where optometry dentistry and pharmacy play huge role serve those who do not even have registered gp be sorry that there be need to do more to promote the contribution that those profession make to the nhs and ensure that they be properly fund in the future welcome the increase in funding for social care and special educational need and disability and in the national minimum wage however in place burden on pensioner and small business owner the budget have miss an opportunity the government could have use wealth taxis on those in our society with the broad shoulder to raise the revenue necessary to fund improvement in our public service instead they allow the money to be raise from small business and those who be most vulnerable such as our pensioner warmly welcome the additional billion that this budget will deliver to the scottish government the large settlement in the history of devolution that additional funding can rebuild scotland and our fail public service but the scottish government must now take responsibility admit their failure and take long term approach that be serious about address scotland challenge economic and political stability underpin the chancellor budget the undoubted attractiveness of scotland for domestic and international investment require the removal of uncertainty which can hinder investment plan only when there be government in scotland who seek to genuinely work collaboratively with the uk government and the private sector on investment plan for not just the next decade but beyond will we fully reap the benefit of this budget however we have government in scotland who make policy and economic decision through the prism of the constitution and who seek as matter of ideology to find point of difference and divergence that be demonstrate by their failure to even turn up and vote for gb energy unquestionably an economic opportunity for scotland the chancellor have commit the uk government to work closely with the scottish government on the industrial strategy and the national wealth fund but the vehicle for promote that collaboration the council of the nations and regions be unfortunately be undermine by the snp which can not bear the prospect of uk joint working be success it have be manufacture grievance on behalf of local council regard representation on the council although it have be the most centralise administration that these island have ever see disproportionately strip local government in scotland of power and resource welcome the effort of the secretary of state for scotland to rise above this petty divisiveness in pursuit of high vision for job growth and prosperity this budget be serious strategic long term approach to fix our country an approach that we have not see from the scottish government or in the last year from the conservative government it sit alongside an ambitious investment and industrial strategy again something that we have not see from either the snp or the conservatives in power in the last decade or so be confident that with this new approach we can rebuild our economy and country and therefore welcome the measure outline in the budget to rebuild britain it would be remiss of not to take this opportunity to congratulate the president of the united states of america donald trump the fact that president trump make such comeback after one term out of office should be warning to this government if they continue on trajectory of burden ordinary working class people and business financially and with their anti life policy their stay in office will be equally short the theme for today debate be rebuild britain yet in reality the budget have the potential to rock the very foundation of the united kingdom this government budget have deal the most devastating blow to so many million pensioner be leave reel from the decision to cut the winter fuel payment with many now have to choose between heating and eating and the waspi woman have be fail again as there be no provision to right the wrong that have impact so many woman across the united kingdom include in my constituency of upper bann prior to the budget have warn this house that in the space of month four cafés in portadown in my constituency close their door this budget will undoubtedly close many more the requirement on business to pay additional national insurance contribution will tell tale this be not budget for work people despite the rise in the living wage because that rise will be swallow up by high retail cost due to the rise in national insurance contribution for employer it be cause and effect algorithm this budget hit worker and business the prime minister and his chancellor have betray our nation farmer decimate our family farm and jeopardise our proud rural heritage the introduction of inheritance tax on family farm value at over million mark an unprecedented and unjust assault on the backbone of our nation no farm or farmer mean no home grow food and rise cost as we have to import food to eat this policy threaten the survival of family run farm force many especially in northern ireland to consider sell off land or asset to meet tax liability thereby undermine the continuity of farming business across generation for northern ireland this tax burden loom heavy family farm will be dismantle to cover liability erode the very fabric of rural life urge the government to stop with the spin and more importantly stop the farm tax and to implement policy that support our farmer rather than hinder they we must prioritise the sustainability of our agricultural sector to preserve our rural community and to ensure the prosperity of our nation and food security for future generation some have speak today of the wait for this budget depend on our perspective we wait either week or year and be in the latter camp be proud to sit behind my right hon friend the member for leeds west and pudsey rachel reeves the first woman chancellor in the year history of the office as she deliver the budget last week and be even more proud of the budget that she introduce and what it mean for work people of all age in cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy one in four child in my constituency be grow up in poverty they have be fail by two opposition party save the children scotland say this year that the scottish government policy would not move the dial on child poverty and the snp have consistently fail to meet the target it have set once again its member be not here to listen to the debate because of this budget labour fair repayment rate will mean that more than million of the uk poor household will be year well off from next april that be expect to benefit household in scotland and to begin at last to drive down dependence on emergency food parcel many of those visit food bank be in work and the increase to the national living wage and the even large increase for to year old be an important recognition of the financial difficulty in which many of my constituent find themselves in fife alone more than low pay worker stand to benefit from the increase to the national living wage the mineworker pension scheme will return more than billion to former coal worker of whom be in my constituency that mean that the people who power our country who be so badly mistreat for so many year by the conservatives will receive increase to their annual pension finally labour budget deliver the large financial settlement to the scottish government in the history of devolution with an extra billion next year alone it be over to the snp now to use that competently to fix scotland precious public service which the snp have run down over the past year in conclusion this budget deliver for all age group and all part of my constituency in enact our manifesto commitment to make work pay to revive our public service and to tackle poverty be proud to support this historic budget commend those who have make their maiden speech and commend member for their collegiate and warm response people in north norfolk will welcome aspect of this budget such as the promise of great spending on our national health service but for all that welcome stability they have several significant concern the potential for increase cost for north norfolk gp surgery and all sort of other care provider through the national insurance rise be huge worry the huge challenge face rural constituency from this budget be the government family farm tax want to share the story of judith with the house she be constituent of mine who live on her farm in antingham she and her husband be fifth generation farmer and they have rear prize win cattle on their small farm their son have be work on the farm with they for the past year he be also carer for his father judith husband who be in the advanced stage of alzheimer disease judith be lose sleep over whether her son will be force to sell the farm and its machinery to pay the death duty which will mean an end to generation of family farm on their land these be hard work honest norfolk farmer not multimillionaire or land baron indeed many norfolk farmer have contact before and since the budget to share their concern and be proud to be stand up for they today north norfolk will also feel the brunt of the increase in the bus fare cap rural public transport be lifeline for many resident live in our village it get they to the shop to the doctor and to see friend and family ask they to swallow an increase in cost while londoner continue to enjoy cap be ludicrous they along with pensioner in north norfolk who have already lose the winter fuel allowance be start to question the change that this government be offer honestly believe that this be budget of extremely good intention from labour but sadly handful of misstep have lead many in north norfolk to question the direction in which we be go hope to work with the government to see how we can ensure that the positive part of this budget deliver for north norfolk and remedy the issue cause the most angst as ever will be put north norfolk resident first stand up for constituent raise their concern and ensure that their voice be hear loudly and clearly family in my constituency have be hit hard in recent year by rise inflation outpace their take home pay be delighted therefore that the chancellor have already recognise the importance of public servant with fair pay rise of or for the military mean that nurse teacher and service personnel be fairly recognise for their hard work we be also recognise worker through the rise in the national living wage to an hour which will make huge difference to living standard for my constituent in north east derbyshire enable more people particularly young people to stand on their own two foot one of the big issue hear about from constituent be the terrible state of the special educational need and disability provision by derbyshire county council the conservatives have determinedly and deliberately run the council into dire financial position leave many child pay the price through long waiting list for assessment and inadequate support which cost the council even more in fine be proud that we in labour will not accept this tory neglect of vulnerable child and have allocate an extra billion to reform send that show the difference labour government can make to ordinary family we be fortunate in north east derbyshire to have wealth of small business include retail on our high street and service business whether in landscaping or consulting we in labour know the value of reward those who be prepared to take risk and build their own business be delighted that the threshold at which employer national insurance contribution be make have be increase to mean that many small business in north east derbyshire will see the cost of employ people fall and their ability to grow rise under labour we know the future be bright for business declare that have financial interest in some of the budget measure the budget be one of broken promise and poorly think out measure for every generation for child who attend private school their school will face vat quite apart from the disruption that will cause it be unlikely to raise the money the government suggest because the wealthy parent have already pay more student will need to be look after in the state sector there will be great demand on send service and there will be reduction in employment among staff who previously work at such school the prime minister tell those who go to university that he want to abolish tuition fee wonder whether they be surprised that he have put they up young people want to buy their first home will see stamp duty threshold fall and many more will pay stamp duty on their first home what of those work people the labour party have find it so difficult to define first they have to get to work those who use the bus will find that the fare have increase by those who have commercial pick up truck will see that the tax on they have go up too what about the national insurance rise it be tax on every single work person and it have not be think through as public sector worker will also need to pay the national insurance the government say to the times that they be go to provide mitigation but the department of health and social care do not seem to know how much it be go to cost to start with ask write parliamentary question and be tell it will take long to prepare an answer the department do not seem to know how much it will cost directly or indirectly many right hon and hon member have talk today about the indirect cost that will face air ambulance hospice general practice opticians care home mental health service and outsource laundry catering and human resource what about the private hospital deliver waiting list initiative work for the nhs they will also need to put up price will the nurse who work at private hospital do proportion of she or his work for the nhs and proportion for private enterprise be partly recompensed or not it have not be properly think through we will need the nhs for all those old people cold and vulnerable in their home who have have the winter fuel allowance snatch from they people the labour government have let down if they die they have the prospect of further taxation on their pension business asset and family farm my hon friend raise the issue of family farm do she agree that it have be hugely disingenuous of the government to repeatedly say they have farmer back only to abandon agricultural property relief at the first opportunity do as farmer wife particularly recognise the effort of family to work together on farm it be not the most profitable work but be labour of true love those who need pint after listen to all the increase in taxation across the generation may be pleased to hear that pint be go to be penny cheap woo hoo but with business rate relief for pub and other hospitality have go from to and the rise in the minimum wage and in national insurance contribution the likelihood be that price will not go down at all lead to further disappointment the budget be bad for business bad for growth bad for the young and bad for the old but most of all it be break of trust it be litany of broken promise from the labour government to the public labour voter like the prime minister favourite singer may be say to themselves do you have to do this be think that you could be trust it be pleasure to contribute to this debate on the first labour budget in year and particularly to mention the impact that it will have on my constituent in kilmarnock and loudoun and on scotland as whole this labour budget deliver the large settlement for the scottish government in the history of devolution it mean an additional billion for the scottish government to spend this financial year and an additional billion next year this be budget that keep our promise to scotland end the era of year of tory austerity provide billion in investment in public service and prioritise economic growth the budget be good for the scotland office good for scottish labour and most importantly good for the people of scotland an aspect of the budget that be particularly welcome be the reserved spending from the uk government which be necessary due to the snp administration in scotland at good spending on their own priority and at worst waste money on silly vanity project or legal fee to cover up freedom of information request the reserved spending will go directly to those community who need it such as kilmarnock the large town in my community despite the aforementione big financial settlement in the history of devolution the nationalist have take scotland in the wrong direction and have be careless with scotland money the snp administration can not continue to blame other for their own economic incompetence it be about time that they apologise to the people of scotland for their mismanagement of public fund but will not hold my breath the problem in scottish public service create by the snp be not solve by have more money to spend put simply the snp need to get smart at spend it the snp waste million on delay discharge and agency staff in our nhs on ferry that never sail and on pet project that do not deliver for scotland all the while decimate local community funding mean that vital service be be lose while labour have commit not to increase taxis on work people the snp continue to try to use income tax as substitute for economic growth with those earn over pay more labour manifesto commitment to brand scotland have be realise an initial investment of will fund trade mission promote scottish good and service around the world and help scottish business export for the first time this be the budget that my constituent have be wait for the budget that scotland have be wait for and the budget that the uk have be wait for fully support it will start by welcome few measure in the budget in particular the increase in the carer allowance and the funding for the nhs that be sorely need after the last government there be something that be confused about though this as trail in the labour manifesto be mean to be budget for growth indeed that be how the chancellor introduce it last wednesday and the secretary of state in open the debate today say that the budget will bring growth but it do not appear to help small business which be the engine of our economy employ over half the people in it and provide of the revenue in my constituency of tunbridge wells be adrian scripps which grow of the uk apple crop james its manage director tell that its labour cost will go up by so this year if he do nothing about it he will lose of his profit and this be good year so in lean year he would lose money if business produce of the uk apple crop be to lose out from the budget what do that mean for the wide sme sector as an aside if be to ask james what he think about the government policy on europe which be essentially continuation of the previous government could not repeat what he would say in the chamber as result of this budget james will have to lay off staff people lose job do not grow the economy have short time leave but would like to talk about toby who run the chapel salon in tunbridge wells he be also the head of the salon employers association which represent salon across the united kingdom he estimate that more than of salon may go under as result of this budget cut hair be labour intensive and the margin be wafer thin business go insolvent do not grow the economy understand and agree that we need to invest in our public service think the government have get that bit of the budget right but disagree with who be tax to pay for it the liberal democrats think that we should tax big business and the labour government think that we should tax small business that be not on after more than decade of stagnation this budget provide the vital reset that our economy need not just to address the immediate challenge we face but to lay the foundation for bright and fair future for all there be many welcome measure in this budget and of particular importance to my constituency will be the increase in the carer allowance weekly earning limit give carer great flexibility to work and increase their financial security the additional billion for send and alternative provision be vital first step as we begin the work to rebuild the broken system and to restore trust with parent that education can be inclusive supportive and break from the adversarial model that be the root of the crisis they face today will focus on housing as we strive to get britain building once again have work in the social housing sector for the past year be convinced that whether the issue be educational opportunity for child live in overcrowded accommodation the healthcare need of people with the blight of damp and mould on their bedroom wall or the cost of living pressure cause by poorly insulate or draughty home fix the housing crisis be the solution safe decent and affordable home be the cornerstone of dignified life when people have decent safe accommodation that be suit to their need they have strong foundation on which to build their life that in turn have stabilise effect on their family and the wide community in recent year we have witness dramatic rise in house price and soar rental cost leave many individual and family struggle to secure roof over their head in my area average price have increase by since while earning have increase by only over the same period for many young hard work people the dream of home ownership have slip away that be why the million investment in the affordable home programme be so important as well as the long term settlement for social rent to give confidence to our register provider to make their own investment it be important that we ensure that support be in place for vulnerable population which be why welcome the additional million allocate to tackle homelessness bring total spending in this area to billion we believe that every individual deserve safe and stable place to call home that be how we transform life and strengthen community be proud that we have labour government in office who take the housing crisis seriously government who be dedicate to deliver the change that our country so desperately need and deliver hope for bright future for everyone this government will build britain where everyone have place to call home rise order to ensure that can get in as many people as possible there should be no further intervention in mid sussex we do not have many large employer so small and medium sized enterprise truly be the backbone of our economy when watch the budget statement bob from hurstpierpoint who be involve in multiple small mid sussex business tell the big loser be small business bob be already have to make contingency plan and think seriously about his workforce go forward he be right to say that without thrive small business and sme the ability of local community to thrive be inhibit that be true in mid sussex and in community up and down the country another constituent of mine ian who have invest considerably in local business and employ number of local people say that he feel abandon the catastrophic impact of the decision will be not just on employer but on employee none more than those in mid sussex gp and care business who have write to since the budget niki from hassocks director in social care organisation support adult with learn disability raise two point first the national insurance change will have disastrous impact on the sector with social care provider already struggle hit in recent year by covid interest rate hike rise in the national living wage and the cost of living crisis many be teeter on the brink secondly social care provider will feel the government measure acutely and disproportionately they be people business so almost their entire cost base be hit by the national insurance increase they employ many people on low wage so shift the national insurance threshold to have huge impact katie lindfield gp say that the change would directly undermine patient access and patient care in our area she say there be dwindle partner number old estate difficulty recruit staff we partner be sure how long we can keep provide increase healthcare for my constituent tom gp partner tell that because practice do not charge patient they do not have the option to put up their price as business might he be try to digest how he feel about partner bear the brunt of these change gps have tell that they be not entitle to claim employment allowance and we need clarity on that essential point this be why the liberal democrats be call for gps and care provider to be exempt from national insurance rise when those who employ we care for we and choose to base their business in mid sussex feel insult abandon and unsupported fail to see how this decision be the right one the budget speak to the need and ambition of my constituency support our community

transport be optimistic that our ongoing effort will soon deliver the change that my constituent deserve my area have proud industrial heritage and the budget provide lifeline to manufacturing area with the first industrial strategy since we will finally be take long term approach to training skill and investment this mean that our skilled worker and young people in staffordshire will not have to leave for opportunity elsewhere but will instead find they exactly where they should be back by investment in green technology and clean energy initiative such as great british energy these be not just big ticket item they be the job training and progress that people in my constituency need then there be public procurement with our commitment to back british firm and british job with public tender with new regulation require fast payment and favour british firm we be see tangible support for the small and medium sized business that be the backbone of our society we must buy more british

resilience in every part of the country it be about remind every family in burton and every business in uttoxeter that they be not just part of the economy they be part of britain future too thank you for call madam deputy speaker be not expect you to do so may associate myself with the remark make by my hon friend the member for north norfolk steff aquarone apropos farm and farmer madam deputy speaker you can call you hear talk about health service in the remote far north of scotland more time than care to remember member refer to the nhs as be on its back which be nowhere true than in my constituency the people in caithness and sutherland know that when they come to put cross on the ballot paper in july which be why we get the result that we do would say to my hon friend who represent other scottish constituency that that be true elsewhere too two doctor in my constituency dr alison brooks in thurso and dr ewen pearson in wick have make it very clear to what the effect of the increase in employer national insurance will mean do not want to bore the chamber because we have hear lot about that already but the hon member for stroud dr opher who be not in his place refer to possible mitigation and hope that that will prove to be the case otherwise we could face the diminution of service and even find that job will go which would be totally and completely unacceptable be sit in the chamber when the chancellor announce the billion for the scottish government and hear nine soft thud as nine chin hit the deck behind the snp have the old wail dirge ready it westminster what do it we ai get the cash oh none of they be here what shame well be just go to say what other member have say hope that the snp scottish government get off their backside and spend the money properly there be no hiding now and there be no excuse they have get the dosh madam deputy speaker how many time have you hear talk about mum have to go on more than mile return trip to give birth in the middle of winter be we joke it be amazing that something dreadful have not happen the doctor speak to about national insurance contribution tell that gynae service in the far north of scotland be on their knee dr pearson tell about mum who have to wait two year to get hysterectomy be that not disgrace in the county of caithness there be not one psychologist damn fact because we know that mental health be such problem there be no hiding the scottish government should get on with the day job and sort out the nhs in my constituency and the rest of scotland they have no excuse in the time allow will confine myself to few comment on the budget financial settlement for the ministry of justice the moj be one of the small departments in budgetary term but have suffer the large cut in proportion to its size give its role in keep we safe provide high quality judicial and court system and offer access to justice that be not dependent on mean the previous government action be not just regrettable but reckless be therefore please to see substantial real term investment for the first time in year it be not enough to resolve all the crisis but it be start in turn thing around total moj spending will rise from billion in the last financial year to billion in the next an average real term increase of year and the law officer budget will increase by year over the same period some of that funding have rightly be direct at prison and probation with billion to be spend on new prison half billion pound on maintenance and security budget and the same on recruit new staff however the budget make no mention of civil and criminal legal aid or of additional money to address the unsustainably large court backlog this year settlement fund crown court sitting day not enough to address the backlog which grow ever large trial be be list for and there be similar logjam in the civil and family court and tribunal as of november the prison population be prison be run at almost full capacity and the prison population be project to increase to by march and up to by march prison be in dire state prisoner be be hold in unsafe crowded condition on an estate plague by widespread disrepair and severe maintenance backlog fire safety standard on the prison estate be woefully poor and we have to ensure that there be plan for probation to grow in response to measure to reduce prisoner number legal aid be another area of acute pressure will any of the new money allocate to the department be spend on legal aid failure to invest will deny access to justice and it would not be possible to tackle the grow court backlog without further investment in criminal and civil legal aid be pleased that the minister say yesterday in reply to question from in the house that there will be announcement in the next few week on legal aid this be an excellent start but there be long way to go to repair our broken justice system it be pleasure and privilege to listen to some excellent maiden speech as welsh liberal democrat be pleased to play my part in constructive opposition want to see thing get do for wales and there be certainly part of this budget that we welcome for example the increase in the carer allowance that my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey and the liberal democrats have campaign so hard for around of the welsh population be estimate to be unpaid carer and many of they will see real difference thank to this initiative we also thank the government for listen to our call for extra funding for the nhs and social care it be now over to the welsh government to ensure that all consequential money be spend on health and social care which have not always happen in the past with people stick on waiting list in wales which be nearly third of the population this could not be more urgent we want to see further action on social care some of bed in powys be currently block and the patient be unable to be discharge to go back to their home and family that be something that must end fix our health service be key and it be for this reason that we have call for the national insurance hike to be remove for care provider and gps be proud to have mining heritage in my family and welcome the boost to former miner pension but confusion remain over the future of the british coal staff superannuation scheme which have over member many of they across south wales further clarification have not be provide so far for those former miner time be run out for many of they and we urgently call on the government to provide some reassurance to they we have less favourable view on other element of the budget include the change to agricultural property relief which be cause great deal of genuine anxiety across my constituency and wales as whole if the labour government do not change course they will be throw family farm to the wolf in the same way that other industry have be let down in the past the impact will be feel not just by young farmer unable to take on viable farm business but in wide consequence the entire rural economy be dependent on farming income so the change will threaten job across wales we do not understand why the government be not raise the revenue from other source why should welsh farmer bear the brunt of repair the economic damage cause by the conservatives it be privilege to speak in this debate follow the first labour budget in over year and the first in year to be give by woman this might not be an achievement that the leader of the opposition think be of any note but can tell she and the house that in my constituency of cardiff west it be proud moment and one that woman and girl in my constituency take great pride in after year of chaos and instability this labour government have make their choice know in this budget this labour government have choose to deal with the billion black hole leave by the tories and to be honest about it with the british public this labour government have choose to stabilise our economy so that we can grow our economy this labour government have choose to invest in our public service and to end the austerity of the last year and this labour government have choose to support and work with our devolved government rather than denigrate they despite our dire economic inheritance from the tories the chancellor have make some tough choice while hold true to our party value in deliver budget that support and invest in work people throughout our region and nation this budget have deliver for my constituency and for wales more generally this be the big budget since devolution it provide record billion spending boost for the welsh government to support public service as result my constituent will see the benefit both through the barnett formula and through direct spending be also proud that the budget have set aside million to support steel community both through the transition board and through the town centre regeneration fund for the first time ever it allocate funding to make coal tip safe with million in new money but let we not forget why the choice in this budget be necessary the tories crash the economy and we have to fix it in so do we have ensure that work people will not face high taxis in their payslip and we be increase the national living wage by when we talk about choice let we not forget the choice that the conservatives have make they have choose to oppose this budget which mean they be oppose to the investment that will grow our economy they be oppose to invest in and reform our public service which can only mean that they remain committed to continue austerity do not even know where to begin with the tories disgraceful position of allocate no money whatsoever to their promise to pay compensation to the victim of the contaminated blood and post office horizon scandal my constituent sue sparkes and other have fight this injustice tirelessly this budget show the difference be make by the labour governments in westminster and cardiff and celebrate it the return tide of populism that we have see today be sobering reminder of what can happen when people feel that the system have not be deliver for they this reality make fiscal event such as budget deliver by new government so critical budget be more than just an annual accounting practice it represent an opportunity to reassure our community that they can trust we all of we to recognise their need aspiration and concern budget be an opportunity to meet those need and to inoculate our community and our country against the populist contagion that have invade yet another host today against that backdrop will shamelessly share some of eastbourne need eastbourne need support to tackle homelessness which have mean that our food bank be the country busy last year therefore welcome the million announce in the budget for homelessness prevention and hope the east sussex float support service can benefit from it but we have be let down by the lack of emergency support to help council like mine with the unsustainable cost of temporary accommodation as so eloquently describe by the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi eastbourne also need service at our local hospital where be bear to be protect welcome the nhs investment announce in the budget but be disappointed that the status of investment in our hospital via the new hospital programme have still not be confirm this mean that local mum who in many case be have to travel more than mile to have their baby be still unclear about what investment their hospital will get our significant population of local pensioner and have plead with the government to review their decision to remove the winter fuel allowance from many pensioner who need it it be unacceptable that those call have be ignore our local business need additional support to thrive yet the increase in employer nic will make it hard for they to survive especially many of our hospitality business which be proud to represent as patron of the eastbourne hospitality association eastbourne waspi woman lead by angela boas deserve compensation which be miss from the budget eastbourne send family support by advocate like kate humphries must benefit from the billion send funding that be announce overall the government have make progress but they must go far to reassure my community that they will deliver for eastbourne on all the count have describe failure to deliver will leave my town more vulnerable to the vice of great hardship and more expose to the venom of populist predator congratulate member on both side of the house on their excellent maiden speech today it be pleasure to speak in the debate for far too long people in north wales have suffer because of stagnant wage fall living standard and rise cost that be the legacy of the last conservative government and why our country have vote for change last week we see budget that turn the page on an era of unfunded policy and stick plaster politic last week budget be an honest budget which will fix the foundation of our economy and improve living standard for people in community like mine thank the chancellor for this historic budget and what it mean for wales the chancellor have deliver record billion to the welsh government to invest in public

people in wales will receive pay rise next year as result of the increase in the minimum wage mean more people have more money in their pocket to spend in our local economy include in our shop and cafés and on our high street be proud that we now have two labour governments work hand in hand in the interest of the people of wales and the uk this budget be not just about rebuild our country it

worksop or the failure to stop doncaster airport closing the tories have leave it to labour to pick up the piece to sort out their mess and to get britain back on course congratulate all of today maiden speaker on their excellent contribution in her budget statement last week the chancellor announce billion increase for special educational need and disability any additional funding be of course very welcome especially in surrey where the send system be in crisis but it be important to put that figure in context estimate suggest that the national send budget be run an annual deficit of billion rise to nearly billion in the whole system be be save from complete collapse thank only to statutory override an accountancy trick that allow council to keep these deficit off their book until march what happen after that no one yet know but the national audit office have warn that the uk send system teeter on the brink of collapse surrey county council alone be carry an eye water million send deficit so while the chancellor additional billion investment may sound promising it really only buy little time few week ago spend morning with group of nearly parent each of whom have child or

become full time carer with one or both parent give up pay employment to take on caring responsibility each year thousand of private and public sector worker be lose from the economy because send provision be fail child and parent alike parent tell that when they be not educate their child they work late into the night administer appeal process gather evidence for tribunal and seek help from charity and agency that might just help to unlock the broken send system for they that be the daily pattern for many thousand of household across the country yet the experience can feel crushingly lonely the send system pull work people out of their career and out of the workforce while permanently limit the life and career chance of child with incredible potential those human and economic cost be barely account for in the government budget setting if this be indeed government who prioritise economic growth and seek to invest in work people encourage they to see reform and proper funding of special educational need as vital component of their national mission when be out knock on door and listen to fellow resident at the weekend many people in winterbourne say how pleased they be to see we begin the change that have be so desperately need by so many for so long from our nhs and our school to our industry and our road this labour budget be focus on fix the foundation deliver change

support by brilliant sme be innovate every day to reduce emission and lead the way in british enterprise know that local people will join in welcome our government investment of million in the aerospace sector in the budget that will fund vital research and development for the late aerospace technology in our region and beyond that be important because rebuild britain be also about restore britain leadership and place on the world stage we have strong defence sector locally include mod abbey wood so welcome the billion uplift in defence funding in addition to the funding for ukraine for as long as it be need our support must never waver as the first ever woman to represent my constituency note what an important moment it be to see the first woman chancellor in our country history stand to deliver the budget representation matter as do deliver change this budget do what our new labour government be elect to do it set the path for rebuild britain look forward to support those effort on behalf of my community who elect to deliver that change certainly the budget have be on the mind of many of my constituent it be even topic of conversation with the owner of gurkha sunkoshi when collect an indian takeaway last night will say more about the impact on small business such as his shortly but let start with the positive it be certainly excellent to see the government commit to nhs investment which have be the subject of key liberal democrat campaign include in my constituency also welcome the compensation for victim of the infected blood and post office horizon scandal agree with colleague who have highlight the point that the increase in carer allowance and send provision be welcome but do not go far enough nevertheless there be much cause for concern for my constituent particularly small business owner gp and dental surgery be concern about rise cost as result of increase to employer national insurance contribution and the minimum wage alas so far they have not receive assurance of additional funding to match the liability that they will face of course they run the risk of need to reduce staff recruitment or even lay off staff which could add to pressure on the local health service the same issue apply to the wide small business and high tech sector in my constituency include indian restaurant my constituency have be assess by the startup coalition as no in the country for new business not least thank to our high tech business park milton park culham campus and the harwell science and innovation campus those business will be worried about the ability to grow because of the cost that they face many of my colleague have highlight concern about the propose family farm tax the liberal democrats call for an extra billion year in support for farming community it be on transport policy that the budget most disappoint perhaps give the propose increase in the bus fare cap and the above inflation increase to rail fare the government be under the impression that work family only use car season ticket from didcot in my constituency to london plus travelcard already cost around year those policy undermine the government state objective on economic growth climate change and reduce congestion also regret that there be no commitment to local rail scheme in my constituency such as new station at wantage and grove and electrification between didcot and oxford today election result in the united states emphasise the importance of manage the economy and public service so that people feel listened to and support my fear be that some of the budget measure will have the opposite effect but genuinely wish the government success and hope that they will listen to and address the many concern raise by the budget congratulate hon member who have deliver maiden speech today on their thoughtful contribution this budget mark the end of an era of austerity inflict by the conservative party over the past year during which time take home pay be cut to the bone and our public service almost reach existential crisis in scotland we have the trouble of two fail government the snp promise scandinavian type public service while the conservative party promise north american level of taxation the result be break public service and complete misuse of taxpayer money be proud of many thing in the budget but be most proud that next april the national minimum wage will rise to an hour that will lift the earning of people in scotland and people in my glasgow south west constituency this labour government will ensure that work pay and that it be secure and dignified the budget continue and increase direct investment in scotland through the innovation accelerator programme which support project in glasgow it also establish brand scotland and support scottish trade abroad by contribute to the scotland office this be the big uplift in scotland funding through barnett consequential since the beginning of devolution in with billion of additional funding within that funding labour have increase the overall education budget by in real term and increase local government funding by so snp run glasgow city council have no excuse to be cut teaching post over the next three year it must not rob young glaswegians of their future because theirs be the contribution that will make our economy grow conservative members use to tell we frequently that they believe in britain and snp members conspicuous by their absence today use to tell we that they be strong for scotland what well embodiment of strength and of that belief than invest in our infrastructure and our people we on the labour benches have make our decision it be now up to they whether they back britain or not in this budget debate be go to focus on the massive disconnect between the government talk about growth and investment and what the obr consider will be the outcome sadly we can want something and talk about it but if we do not enact the policy we be not go to get it that will hit everybody across the country really hard particularly the most vulnerable be see that reality in my constituency where lot of employer be relocate plant abroad to the eu rather than relocate and grow those job in the uk that be not just happen in my constituency very likely it be happen in every other member constituency as well that be huge problem for our public service which be ultimately underwrite by our taxis as result of this budget real private consumption as share of gdp be set to fall by by and real business investment be set to fall by it be not say that it be the obr that be very different from what the secretary of state have tell we it leave real gdp growth low in the outer year in the forecast again not my word but the obr as per obr datum brexit be cut our long run productivity by and be cut the overall trade intensity of our economy by in the long term the uk have free option to boost economic growth at zero fiscal cost by restore close economic relationship with europe however although not single person on labour front bench even vote to leave the eu we find ourselves with government support daft conservative economic policy that nobody in the country vote for such as remain outside the custom union and the single market even before trump win today we as country could not afford to be take these wrong decision continue to do so wilfully and in direct contradiction of the fact be neglectful and show disregard for the wellbeing of our country urge the government to change course this budget be about rebuild britain after year of incompetence negligence and chaos conservative members all four of they who be leave in the chamber today can not even bring themselves to apologise for the inheritance that they leave not just to our government but to the country as whole they should have spend the past few month reflect on why as we can see before we the country reject they so profoundly instead they engage in yet more infighting and ask people not to believe their own eye even now they tell people that the economy have never have it so good that they should ignore their deplete bank account the increase mortgage rate they have to pay and the state of our high street they talk as if our hospital and our school be not leave to crumble as if they do not savage local government finance and the service so many people rely on and as if the criminal justice system have not be push to the point of ruin even when they admit to the desperate state of mental health special educational need dentistry social care homelessness and poverty they talk as if those thing have nothing to do with they it be always someone else fault this budget end the cycle of conservative decline and restore hope that thing can get well just like our nhs britain might have be break by the conservatives but we be not yet beat that be underline by the choice this budget make not always easy but necessary the choice to protect pension with the triple lock the choice not to raise national insurance income tax and vat for work people the choice to unfreeze income tax threshold so that people have more money in their pocket the choice to increase carer allowance the choice to raise the minimum wage to record level the choice to fund thousand of new home for family in town such as ipswich and far beyond and the choice to start rebuild our nhs our school and our infrastructure those be the choice we have make to fix the foundation of the economy and our public service to invest in britain future and to deliver the change that people vote for return to specific issue that have be mention many time in this debate special educational need that be now very much national crisis but it be one that we have be battle in suffolk for the good part of decade billion injection into send be much need as our government look to repair broken system starve of funding resource and focus no money alone will not solve the multitude of issue face family desperately try to get the support their child need we need bold and wide range reform too but new specialist staff and place do not come free and unfunded reform be complete non starter send can not be treat as cinderella service any long the new funding be much need statement of intent from this government and one that will be welcome by family in ipswich and suffolk and across the country this first budget be about clean up the mess of the last year five prime ministers and seven chancellors and repair britain foundation it be about invest in britain and back it to succeed and ensure that when we need public service they be there for we it be an important first step but my goodness the conservative party have make an incredible mess during the general election campaign my team and speak to thousand of people across telford every conversation be about decay our crumble nhs the struggle of our education system and the breaking of our council service the fact that we do not see enough police officer on our street high street in need of support send system that be let child down road and transport system that do not work for work people could go on there be real sense that the government have give up on govern and make many people believe that there be no hope and that decline and doom chaos and corruption be the norm this first budget be watershed moment it mark the return to state that care about make sure people can get the medical treatment they need when they need it that they feel safe on our local street and that they can afford housing the contrast between the hope that this budget offer and the bleak future describe under the conservatives be strike be particularly

association declare an interest on the basis that be now the honorary vice president of that organisation every councillor regardless of political persuasion will talk about the last year with council of all political stripe go bankrupt almost every single year the lga have call this budget step in the right direction but after year of stumble in the wrong direction it be just the start of long

our school the increase to the minimum wage and carer allowance will make tangible difference to many people life the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme will finally be rectify benefit thousand of former miner across nottinghamshire and there be more but there be also element of this budget that worry disabled people fear that the target of deliver saving through reform to the disability benefit system will mean that people be exclude from the support they need it be shameful that people have be force into poverty by the welfare cut of previous government some have even lose their life thank to system that all too often seek to punish rather than to help we must do thing differently we must fund social security net that give everyone whether in work or not the resource they need to live decent life we must also prioritise end child poverty as previous labour government have so be disappoint the chancellor have not move to scrap the inhumane two child benefit limit meanwhile the rich of britons have trillion between they although the budget will modestly increase their contribution to our public finance we must go far to make the super rich pay their fair share we should introduce wealth tax tax earning from wealth at the same rate as wage be confident that this budget take important step to deliver change but be it at the scale we need after the devastation cause by the conservative party be not so sure say that not to undermine the budget which stand in welcome contrast to the last year but to push for even great ambition because the job of back bench government mp be to tell their party when it need to go far trump election be warning to we here if people do not see their life improve the populist right stand to benefit so

starting point and the damage do both to our economy and to business confidence by the last government know from my time spend in industry that over the last decade and half our country have lose out in the race for international investment from combination of political uncertainty and long stand indifference to industrial policy listen carefully to the word of the hon member for great yarmouth rupert lowe and think he must have read different budget from the budget read commit we to public sector investment of over billion over five year which along with our modern industrial strategy set the scale of the government ambition for increase prosperity and security across the whole of our country several member include the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler for tunbridge wells mike martin and for didcot and wantage olly glover mention small business these be the very business which stand to benefit from our industrial strategy as our new approach to industry and manufacturing see the private sector crowding in investment produce well pay job and export that will support our small business in supply chain this will also reverse the tide of deindustrialisation frankly bizarre policy of inaction enact by conservative government over many year that have leave much of our industry include steel chemical and ceramic mention by my hon friend the member for stoke on trent north david williams at serious disadvantage it seem clear that to grow our economy we need to boost productivity and simply build more factory but know as an advocate of industrial strategy that this position be not settle one particularly in the party opposite that be in big contrast to the collaborative approach of this government who work pragmatically with business leader we have hear some warm word from conservative about industrial strategy include from opposition front benchers but they perhaps have not have time to consult with their new leader the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch who have describe such policy as part of the law of diminish return have see my right hon friend the secretary of state for business and trade secure billion of private sector investment we can be sure to borrow metaphor from the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison that have their goose not be cook at the last election return would most certainly have be the diminished this budget will be of benefit to my constituent in stockton billingham and norton who value well pay industrial and manufacturing sector job can understand the confusion of the right hon member for

firm to employ four national living wage worker full time without pay national insurance on their wage at all by more than double the employment allowance for the small business that make up the high

living crisis when listen to the response of the former leader of the opposition it be hard to keep up it be crystal clear to that the bear to rule conservative simply have not understand that they be not rule any more only want to hear one word from the former leader of the opposition sorry that word never come as someone with over year of private sector experience be get bit bored of the trope

economy that be traditionally seasonal with low per capita spend per visitor welcome the chancellor move to permanently low business rate for retail hospitality and leisure and the decision to extend

government those business include grassroots music venue such as the bootleg social which be already fight to keep its door open but make huge contribution to our cultural landscape in blackpool have

congratulate all hon member who have make their maiden speech today the economic inheritance from the last year could hardly have be any bad conservative government have serially undermine our public service they strip they of funding make it hard to deliver and demoralise dedicated public servant the impact of their political choice could not have be clear in multiple crisis which span from our nhs and social care to local authority service school prison policing and criminal justice housing and university instead of reinveste to rebuild they promise billion of pound of entirely unfunded tax cut in desperate bid to cling on to power they have be the vandal of our public service and our economy and they have leave this new labour government with colossal and daunt task to restore and rebuild welcome the budget which seek to fix the foundation and begin the restoration that be need regret that the action of the previous government mean that the road to recovery be so long the additional billion in the budget for send be as welcome as it be essential the crisis in the send system be the big current challenge in the education system with far reach consequence for child and family who be be let down school that can not meet the need of their pupil and local authority that be be drive to the edge of bankruptcy by the cost urge the government to ensure that send remain at the forefront of discussion in the comprehensive spending review because billion while welcome be only third of the current in year deficit in the send budget the statutory override which protect local authority general fund account from send deficit be due to come to an end in march and local authority will soon need certainty about what will happen after that date without clear plan more local authority will be issue section notice that be not something that the government can allow to happen as constituency mp want to use my remain time to raise two other issue arise from the budget the additional funding for the nhs be desperately need the allocation for individual area and health trust have not yet be make want to make particular plea for capital funding for king college hospital king be currently face severe financial challenge which it be work hard to address but that be make hard by lack of funding for the essential equipment that staff need to increase productivity and deliver the service that patient need finally while the additional injection of million for social housing in london and change to the regulation on right to buy be welcome the crisis in london be so deep that the government must turn their attention to the local housing allowance which must keep pace with rent in london to avoid even more family be force into temporary accommodation with knock on consequence for local authority budget the budget seek to fix the foundation and undo the damage that the conservatives have do there be much more to do but the budget be very welcome first step on the road be pleased to vote for it today this be budget that answer the call make by many of the constituent speak to during the general election it be budget for change change for our national health service change in the living standard of work people and change to our decline investment in infrastructure yes there be tough decision we on the government benches do not shy away from that fact the key difference between this government approach and that of our predecessor for the last year be that we simply refuse to place the burden of those tough choice on the back of work family there have be lot of talk about business during the debate but the opposition do business disservice as if the only thing that business care about be the tax bill business also rely on function health service quality education system and investment in our broken infrastructure they also rely on their customer have money in their pocket to spend in the local economy be therefore delight to see transformational uplift in the minimum wage which will positively impact thousand of worker in my constituency of crewe and nantwich welcome also the commitment to extend high speed to euston and the recognition that spend on major infrastructure do not merely carry cost to the taxpayer but have the potential to pay back to society through economic growth and wide societal benefit it be imperative that we now turn our focus towards deliver solution between birmingham and manchester the birmingham to crewe leg of the original project be due to return for every spend welcome the government new approach to infrastructure investment and look forward to work with they to realise the potential of my constituency as transport hub my constituent do not elect labour government to continue the failed miserable image of the future project by the conservative party future where public service can only decline where growth flatline and where the only figure rise be debt destitution and the number of fail prime ministers in single parliament they vote for change and that be what this government deliver so commend the budget to the house be proud to stand up on behalf of my constituent in calder valley and thank this government for the budget deliver by our chancellor budget that rebuild the country and protect the nhs as someone who spend eight year in local government before come to this place recognise some of the huge step that this budget take to cement local government guarantee funding for high street project like those in calder valley and

scourge of pothole most importantly we get three year funding settlement no more annual scrabble in december to work out how to make budget fit local authority and business can plan long term which be what they want and it be the stability that we need it have be quite something to sit through this budget debate for the past few day because it seem like there have be two budgets one be deliver by my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer which fix our foundation support hospitality and the high street provide billion for the nhs find funding for send and open breakfast club then there have be the budget that exist in the imagination of opposition members today the leader of the opposition claim that it do not mention the word defence the speech mention it six time and the budget have whole section in the funding settlement for defence today we hear from the hon member for solihull west and shirley dr shastri hurst and for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson about the problem of social care that should not be new concern for conservative members andrew dilnot release his report in we be then promise that we would get some kind of proposal in in the conservative government release their proposal but then withdraw it because they have an election they then delay it in it come back in and be delay again in then they say that they would deliver it in but do not find the funding throughout all that there have not be shred of contrition or acknowledgment from the conservatives that they leave the country on its knee they have no idea yet why the public reject they so resoundingly at the last election hope that as they sum up they will perhaps show some contrition and answer the budget as it be not the one that exist only in their imagination refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests my wife be employ as special educational need co ordinator in one of our local authority school my constituent in bexleyheath and

detail my local authority sign safety valve agreement to avert effective bankruptcy and like other authority we have hear about today it now face tick time bomb signal the run out of the statutory override in its finance will be boost by the increase spending power provide in the budget it be three year since my conservative council seek capitalisation order and make of staff redundant to stave

second home buyer which should lead to more house on the market for local people the budget provide extra money for council to build affordable and social housing as well as limit the discount on sell

so we should probably all declare that most of we receive funding from business during the general election campaign certainly do and pay tribute to the small business in my constituency some of they be consider microbusinesse with few than employee so the majority will pay less national insurance under this budget thank the chancellor for protect work people and small business listen to conservative members as we have be do for the past five hour it seem that many of they see the business community as care about nothing but quick profit and avoid tax but the local business that speak to are proud not only to deliver quality product and service but to create good job and strengthen the local economy they have be do that in try circumstance and many of they have support labour candidate at this election because they want government who match their ambition when ask they what they want to see from government they say they want not only fair tax system but investment and that be what this budget deliver they want secure power supply they also want fast planning decision include the young farmer who come to see because he have be push back for two year now in his attempt to just build some pig pen the big barrier however be that business can not get the staff and this be true from manufacture to hospitality britain be hold back by skill shortage so welcome budget that will invest in britain most precious productive asset her people when we invest in fast nhs appointment in emergency dentistry in mental health in send provision in specialist teacher in stem subject and in childcare we invest in business too because these be the people who will rebuild britain the people of durham have be hold back for too long in the past year our life expectancy have fall behind our child be short and the number of child in care have increase by so we can see the impact of austerity in people body and family life welcome budget that have bring the end of austerity and begin the long hard job of rebuild this country also welcome budget that have put more money in people pocket include by honour the triple lock which the conservatives fail to do in cost pensioner in my constituency we come to the final back bench speaker patrick hurley when stand to speak in this house often criticise the former government and to be fair there be lot to criticise but liz truss at least get one thing right she claim to make economic growth the drive force behind her plan but while truss take reckless big bang approach to tackle the stagnation that this country have experience since our focus be on long term investment not short term tax cut this speak to one of many big problem with recent tory governments problem that any business owner in this country could tell you about it be all about return on investment over the last year there have be too little return because there have be too little investment to combat that we have secure billion in private investment and we have put billion into electric vehicle development note too that the uk space agency say that the space industry be worth billion year to our economy it be no doubt help to ensure that we get early warning of any new super massive black hole we might not be aware of this budget be the beginning of the change our country vote for it will make britain well off there will be more money in people pocket an nhs that be there when people need it business create wealth and opportunity for all the house building that we need the transport infrastructure that we be cry out for wage that make work pay and state pension that be uprated as it should have be all along this be budget of change budget of investment and growth budget to put more money in work people pocket and budget to get our public service back on their foot it be the most welcome budget for many year budget in line with the value of the british people be proud to support this labour budget call the shadow minister thank the back bench members who have speak in this debate and commiserate with the two labour members who do not get in be sure that they will have their opportunity in future congratulate the four member who give their maiden speech the hon member for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell for stoke on trent north david williams for ely and east cambridgeshire charlotte cane and for sherwood forest michelle welsh many in this house will remember their maiden speech and will know how anxious those four member be before they stand up to speak and how relieved they be when they reach the end and could sit down that feeling do not go away we end this budget debate where we begin with the deceit that the labour party show to the british public about its intention to launch one of the big tax grab in our history at the election labour front benchers tour the country stag photo op snap cheeky selfie and solicit reassuring quote from business farmer and senior citizen say to each in turn that they could trust labour and that labour government would have their back this budget of broken promise show that they have all be con my conservative colleague have lay bare always clearly and frequently with strong feeling the consequence of the political choice this labour government have make with this budget colleague have speak on behalf of britain farming family on behalf of our country small business on behalf of parent with child in education on behalf of gp surgery and hospice and above all on behalf of the work people they represent who have be target by this budget this be budget of choice and the choice be labour and theirs alone their choice to increase taxis their choice to increase debt their choice to change the fiscal rule and their choice to rip up election promise after election promise just as the labour government have make their choice today we must start to make our own choice our choice be to help the small business owner to help the aspire entrepreneur to help those thinking of use their talent to help build britain to help the farmer whose parent and grandparent have toil in our field to help the child who will be turf out of their school in the middle of the year some have no school place to go to and to protect the worker of britain who believe what labour say at the election and who now know they be con that be why we will vote against budget resolution this evening two group of people have be clobber drastically by this budget group who be the cornerstone of our economy as we have hear throughout these debate the labour government decision to increase employer national insurance contribution be not only manifesto breach but barrier to growth sadly this labour government do not understand that there will never be sustainable public sector without thriving private sector the private sector in this country be delicate fabric of small and medium sized business many have be just scrap by for year but each be spur on by the endeavour that be the spirit of free enterprise run small business labour members may want to take note be not easy our constituent run some million small and medium sized enterprise across the uk so when the minister respond will she explain to those people in my constituency and across the country what they be to do in the face of labour job tax the massive increase in employer national insurance contribution the office for budget responsibility say that the job tax would be pass on by most firm to their employee through reduce wage the resolution foundation say it will have the big proportional impact on low pay worker and the federation of small businesses say it will cause many sme to struggle that be the truth and far cry from the warm word the labour chancellor offer business during the election campaign when the prime minister in february this year look farmer in the eye and say that they deserve well be he already hatch labour family farm tax the nfu have say the shameless breaking of those promise on agricultural property relief will snatch away much of the next generation ability to carry on produce british food the truth be that the labour party do not understand even the basic of farming reduce the relief and impose inheritance tax on farmland will devastate family farm and pose serious risk to domestic food security and food price throughout the debate labour mp have sneeringly refer to those farmer as millionaire but many family farmer be not rich they eke out modest labour members should have be here for the debate many family farm eke out modest and highly uncertain income year after year that be why we ask taxpayer each year to subsidise british farmer so they can continue grow food for britain the family farm tax be not just tax farmer it be tax britain farmland the very land we need to grow the food we eat this budget of broken promise send series of clear message do start your own business because labour will tax you do have plan to hire new employee because labour will tax you do take risk and expect to keep reward because labour will tax you do invest in the education of your child because labour will tax you and do whatever you do farm your land to grow british food because labour will grind you into that very same ground and tax you too finally say to the minister that the trust that have be break in this budget will not be recover people will never forget what happen when labour be give its chance they will never forget the harm do when labour make its choice and they will never forget that labour first budget be budget of broken promise it be an absolute honour to make the closing speech on this historic budget it be historic for two reason first it be the first ever budget to be deliver by woman the first female chancellor of the exchequer after year she have smash the glass ceiling and hope all the woman and young girl watch know that they can be in the drive seat of labour government secondly it be historic because we be finally wipe the slate clean and turn the page on year of tory incompetence chaos and outright instability this budget will make meaningful change by focus on the fundamental do the minister agree that one of the good way of celebrate this budget be with pint of locally brew beer do she agree that the consultation on the pub code announce by the government in the budget statement will be joyful to the ear of local independent brewery in all our constituency thank my hon friend for her intervention know that she be doughty champion of the pub in carlisle the pub in my constituency be celebrate the penny off pint let get back to the previous government who be wrong when they claim that they would fix the roof while the sun be shin while chase budget surplus for which year later all they have to show be catastrophic public finance they merely paint over the ever grow crack in the bedrock of our society and our country that be why this government be right to focus on fix the foundation of our economy because that be the only way that we can change the country deliver for work people and rebuild britain of course buy home be hard if the seller have mislead we about its true condition by underestimate the size and cost of any require repair in that sense rebuild our economy be no different because the previous government public spending plan exist only on paper there be no real allocation of money to back up any of the spending plan they behave no well than some huckster try desperately to sell flat that they know will never be build that be why the obr have say that have it be make aware of the scale of the spending pressure during the spring budget its assessment of the previous government spending plan would have be materially different that be why it be right that we take our time to conduct full survey of the economic inheritance that they leave we will the minister give way no the right hon gentleman have intervene time shall not give he another chance let continue that be the only way that we can really fix the foundation of course that involve take tough decision particularly on spending and taxation but will take no lecture from those who be content to levy billion pound tax on this country future and through their unfunded spending commitment attempt to undemocratically bind the hand of future government well guess what this government will do thing differently while the previous government allow investment in our country to fall to its low level on record this government will put investment at the heart of everything that we do that be why we hold the international investment summit in october to show firm at home and abroad that britain be open for business once more that be why we have introduce new fiscal rule the investment rule which alongside appropriate guardrail provide by the obr and our new stability rule mean that this government can meaningfully invest in our country future of course investment mean take long term view as anyone who have buy property build business or raise family will know the early day be always the hard but if they take the hard call now in time they will get back far more than they put in pick those example deliberately but with regret the sad truth be that for work people particularly young people up and down the country home ownership entrepreneurship and start family have never be more distant this budget will start to change that our manifesto make clear commitment to get britain build again this budget put the first shovel in the ground with commitment to spend an average of of gdp on public sector net investment over the course of this parliament this will include an additional million in new funding for social and affordable home which bring total investment in housing supply to more than billion and support the delivery of ten of thousand of new home we will build more than just home we need to build community infrastructure be key to tie those community together while ensure that they plug into the wide economy interruption the shadow foreign secretary ask how if she listen she will learn so she should pay attention get our country move again will be key to grow the economy interruption she should not chunter from the front bench she need to listen because our commitment to infrastructure investment will help we to do so by for instance increase local road investment by million in these be the thing that the previous government fail to do but we will deliver for our country for work family that mean less time waste dodge pothole and more time for the thing that actually matter of course infrastructure help not just family but firm in an increasingly volatile world government should play an important role in secure our energy supply so that firm can price that into their business plan we hear powerful and authentic maiden speech today from my hon friend the members for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell for stoke on trent north david williams and for sherwood forest michelle welsh we will see they as huge asset to parliament some of they mention that their family do not think that they would get here be really pleased that their family be wrong will finish by echo something that the shadow minister the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller say it be not often that agree with he but he say that we have choice the truth be that we do have choice and guess what we choose to act in year time the country will look back on this budget as the moment when we get britain future back in the future the economy will have grow because at this moment we choose to prioritise healthy workforce we will have record level of investment because we prioritise fiscal and economic responsibility and people will have more money in their pocket because we prioritise protect hard work people payslip the merry go round of austerity and economic irresponsibility be over we

schemes franchising authorities england regulations which be lay before this house on september be wakeford question agree to road fuel market motion make and question propose that this house do now wakeford the topic for this my first adjournment debate be fair fuel pricing an issue that have be raise repeatedly with by resident of dunfermline and dollar since be elect in july and that have be examine by previous government of all colour and by the competition and markets authority in july this year the cma say that weaken competition in the fuel sector be negatively impact driver wallet its examination find that in alone high price cost motorist staggering amount of money in the midst of cost of living crisis that seem especially egregious the cma warning be not however the first or even the second significant warning on fuel pricing after launch market study in july which report year later and make series of recommendation to protect consumer the cma have issue three interim report in those report the cma find that driver be overcharge at the petrol pump by million in and furth billion in that mean that in just two year driver be overcharge by some billion on their fuel in the midst of cost of living crisis that be shameful profiteering which we know hit lower pay worker and family the hard the cost of living crisis have mean that change in the price of utility and fuel have be sorely feel we have long understand the argument that rural driver might pay more for fuel due to the increase logistical cost and additional staffing cost do not always find such argument convincing but they at least have perceive logic to they however fuel be not luxury it be lifeline it enable people to commute to work take their child to school and provide care and support to love one congratulate the hon gentleman on bring the debate forward speak to he beforehand he and share the same concern in relation to fuel driver in rural constituency such as our of strangford and dunfermline and dollar be very much at the mercy of those who seek to charge more for fuel some have to travel far to get cheap fuel and it be debatable whether that be competitive or even logical do he agree that when it come to competitiveness we must have fairness and equality for every postcode and recognise that price in kircubbin the ards peninsula and dunfermline be similar yet in manchester fuel be almost litre cheap thank the hon member for his intervention believe that take an intervention from he be rite of passage in this house could not agree more particularly in relation to constituency such as my own where there be mix of urban and rural area and the rural pricing hit particularly hard those be often area that have poor public transport as well so the impact be feel even more most small business rely on efficient and cost effective transport for their delivery staff and customer and that often mean run and fuel car or van high price at the pump have direct impact on small business and squeeze already thin margin in the ongoing crisis in the cost of live and of do business research by the federation of small businesses show that more than three quarter of small business see their cost go up in the last quarter and of those more than quarter say that the increase price of fuel be one of the main reason for that rise my constituency be just mile from scotland oil refinery in grangemouth yet resident in dunfermline consistently pay full litre more than those nearby in glasgow stirling glenrothes or kirkcaldy that be despite the local supermarket tesco and asda as well as host of other outlet in the city such as bp all supposedly compete to be the driver choice what we see in dunfermline be cluster of price around the same level within the city and price cluster around dunfermline as well with all supermarket and supplier at roughly the same price that be not local competition that be local cartel even bad my constituent be pay per litre at asda in dunfermline whereas in the asda bridge of dee store in aberdeen mile far north they pay just at the pump never mind that be difference of per litre in rural and semi rural area as be say early where public transport infrastructure be less entrenched certainly in my constituency where the train service be frequently short form delay or cancel at short notice fuel be not choice it be necessity my dunfermline and dollar constituent rely on their vehicle more heavily yet often face the high price that be an issue of basic fairness be all in favour of market force be use to shape price but not where the market be demonstrably break and fuel pricing have all the sign of broken market mechanism it be nothing short of outrageous that the most essential aspect of daily life be subject to broken competition non function market and what appear to be price cluster by retailer across the constituency small business and sole trader such as plumber builder florist and taxi driver along with family be pay the price as we might say in scotland small business be be pump at the pump like many fellow member of this house welcome the chancellor announcement in the budget which we pass this evening on freeze fuel duty which will help people who be still feel the impact of out of control inflation on their take home pay however while this pricing behaviour by retailer continue be concerned that the full benefit of the government effort to keep down fuel cost will not be pass on to my constituent to help the house understand fully the consequence of this kind of price clustering and the effect of broken market will share the experience of one of my constituent aimee year old apprentice who write to last month aimee be proud to secure her apprenticeship which she start this autumn earn the apprentice minimum wage of an hour with just over month to live on aimee use month of her hard earn wage on fuel she get her petrol at asda in dunfermline where as mention unleade be per litre yesterday her be buy she litre of fuel however if aimee be buy her petrol at asda bridge of dee in aberdeen where unleaded be litre yesterday she would have pay just for the same amount of fuel that be full month difference over the course of year aimee would have to work an additional hour just to pay for the difference in price of petrol for she to get to and from work that be not justifiable aimee who be learn while earn be experience real term pay cut differential due not to anything she have do but to the effect of this broken market we encourage the use of green transport but we have see the failure of the snp government and scotrail to provide fife with reliable service so that be not an option for people such as aimee with short train and unreliable service particularly in west fife one step that the snp green coalition at holyrood do take be to remove peak fare which see increase in train usage however that encouragement of behavioural change be swiftly remove just like the scottish greens from the coalition when the financial incentive of fair train fare be also remove behavioural change of positive nature do not happen overnight but the switch back to the car from the train do and have that short sighted decision like the short form train that often serve the region have put people off use green transport have be let down by the scottish government commuter in dunfermline be be take advantage of by fuel retailer and market competition in my constituency my hon friend be make an excellent speech have also notice in my constituency that many fuel retailer be not pass on benefit to driver and as he recognise the competition and markets authority have say that those competition practice be unfair notice that the government be take forward fuel finder app which will allow customer and driver to find out more information about different retailer and will drive competition do he agree that the government should do that as soon as possible so we can get that transparent and accurate information and driver in my constituency and other be able to get saving on fuel thank my hon friend for that intervention will come on shortly to the action the government be take and where think there be still more to be do the impact go beyond personal strain it create an uneven playing field for business hinder economic growth by harm small business owner in dunfermline who rely on vehicle for operation in this budget the government have take wide range of step to help work people across the country include in my constituency wage rise for scot record funding to scotland fix the mineworker pension scheme protect the pension triple lock and as have say commit fund to maintain the freeze on fuel duty that the conservatives fail to do and which would otherwise have see people like my constituent aimee pay even more for fuel be also pleased that this new government have confirm that they will implement two of the cma recommendation an open datum scheme call fuel finder that will require all fuel retailer to share their price in real time and road fuel monitor function that will report on the state of competition in the road fuel market scenario modelling by the cma suggest that pump price could reduce by between and litre as result of these measure help to ensure that driver get fair deal for fuel across the uk be keen to hear from the minister what more she think the government can do specifically around ensure fair and functional fuel market so that pricing be fair and not allow to cluster into local price fixing as see in dunfermline fuel price be undoubtedly subject to range of external factor as we have see over the year but by increase transparency and ensure real competition between forecourt we can have function market where competition help drive down price however nothing be prevent fuel retailer from choose to do the right thing right now and to stabilise fuel price to remove price cluster like we see in dunfermline and to ensure that people such as aimee be not financially penalise for where they live hope this government will build on the excellent start they have make to protect work people and small business and hope we will be able to do more to stop fuel retailer profiteer on the back of hard work people up and down the country start by congratulate my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie on secure this debate make such an excellent contribution and champion the need of consumer both in his constituency and across the uk where so many people have the same struggle welcome the opportunity to discuss the important matter of the road fuel market this government be commit to fix the foundation of the economy deliver change by protect work people and rebuild britain it can not be the case that fuel retailer register record profit and do not pass on saving when the burden be be unduly feel by hard work family and business that be why be so grateful for my hon friend story about aimee her story be one that suspect be familiar to many other mp from their constituency we be commit to support people with the cost of living and the cost of fuel agree with my hon friend that for so many vehicle be more than just means of transport they be lifeline they play an integral role in connect work people family community and business especially in rural area in the case of young people include aimee their car be means to forge career and earn meaningful well pay work this government be commit to deliver for driver but also provide range of transport option to make it possible that people such as aimee should not have to worry about how they get to work that be why this government make the decision at last week budget to freeze fuel duty for further year which know my hon friend have welcome commend his dedication to campaign against high fuel price and for family work people and small business to get fair deal on fuel across his constituency and scotland it be imperative that we have well function transparent and competitive road fuel market we want to ensure that driver can get fair price for their fuel and that fuel retailer remain transparent and do not overcharge we expect all fuel retailer to pass on any saving at the pump as my hon friend set out the competition and markets authority publish its road fuel market study in july and it find that competition across the retail market have weaken the cma find problem in relation to three aspect of the retail market national local and motorway at national level the cma find that retail margin have rise significantly since with the supermarket retailer follow similar trend of increase margin on fuel the historic price leader in the market primarily asda but also morrison to some extent have take less aggressive approach to pricing and have significantly increase their margin over recent year the rest of the fuel retailer take passive approach and follow that trend at local level the cma find significant price difference between local area with low price at forecourt typically associate with have supermarket competitor nearby know that my hon friend be concerned about that and recently raise it with the leader of the house at business question as he have do today in this debate by share aimee experience on motorway pricing the cma find that driver without access to fuel card which account for to of fuel sale on motorway be pay significantly more to fill up at motorway service area than they would elsewhere due to limited competitive pressure as result of those factor the cma find that driver have be pay more than would otherwise have be the case it be estimate that the financial impact of the increase in average supermarket fuel margin from to result in combine additional cost of around million for customer of the four supermarket fuel retailer in alone that be equivalent to approximately million month for this period while fuel price be now lot low than at the all time peak in july weakened competition persist the cma late monitoring update in july this year estimate that the increase in retailer fuel margin compare with result in increase fuel cost for driver in of over billion weak competition be still fail consumer that be hugely concern the price of petrol and diesel be an important issue when price be high the impact be feel by everyone we expect all fuel retailer to pass on any saving at the pump as my hon friend say to address these issue the cma make recommendation for the government to implement an open data scheme for fuel price require retailer to share their price on real time basis and allow driver to be well inform on price and easily compare price and to launch an ongoing monitoring function for the retail market to assess how well competition be work the government accept those recommendation on the cma first recommendation as part of the budget last week we confirm that we will implement statutory open datum scheme call fuel finder it will require all retail petrol filling station in the uk to report price and when fuel become unavailable within minute of change the datum will be share openly and freely to third party so that it can be incorporate into their price comparison website or app sat navs and other consumer face product that consumer can use fuel finder will empower driver to compare price more easily and make more inform decision on where to buy their petrol and diesel that will increase pressure on fuel retailer to compete strongly to attract consumer by lower their price or improve their service at the forecourt the government be commit to implement fuel finder as quickly as possible we will begin procurement for the fuel finder aggregator in the data use and access bill that the government have introduce will provide the legislative basis to set up fuel finder subject to parliamentary timing we aim to launch fuel finder by the end of on the cma second recommendation it will receive statutory information gather power through the digital markets competition and consumers act to undertake the permanent monitoring function we be aim to commence those provision by january the cma will be able to assess and monitor the state of competition in the retail market both nationally and locally provide ongoing scrutiny of price and advise the government if further intervention be need to protect consumer the transition from fossil fuel to zero carbon vehicle be likely to lead to further risk of weakening competition in the remain fossil fuel base road fuel market the transition be likely to be feel particularly by less well off consumer and those live in rural area the cma will be able to monitor the market through the transition and benefit consumer by ensure that the market continue to function properly the cma will therefore publish an annual report on the state of competition in the sector three short update on price cost and margin and information on price trend across the uk and over time take together fuel finder and the cma monitoring function will reinforce each other in provide new source of competitive pressure in favour of great competition in the road fuel retail sector one of the interesting thing bring to my attention by resident in harrogate and knaresborough be that while we be quite rural be on the periphery of north yorkshire there be an aspect about be an area with tourist along with high housing and other cost more generally when we be talk about try to reduce fuel price can the minister give any further information on what consideration will be give to regional and inter regional inequality in pricing the hon gentleman make good point that be why we need to start monitor the situation properly when we all have access to that real time datum and can understand exactly what be happen the cma can be monitor that and report to the government the government can say actually there be more systemic problem here that we need to tackle we need to make more intervention the government stand ready to look to do those thing but the first stage of have the datum available so that we understand properly what be go on will help we to do that fuel price be inevitably uncertain and sensitive to wide global factor but our publish impact assessment estimate that increase transparency and encourage competition between petrol filling station could result in fuel cost saving for driver total billion over year that amount to saving of to per litre at the pump be sure that my hon friend and other will agree that that would be welcome in addition at the budget the chancellor announce that the government be extend the temporary cut to fuel duty rate for further month until march alongside that the government will not increase rate in line with the retail price index or rpi take together that be tax cut worth billion in the freeze in fuel duty will save the average car driver in these action have be welcome by stakeholder such as the rac and the aa let assure the house and my hon friend that the government be commit to deliver for driver our ultimate goal be to increase the level of transparency for consumer and encourage fuel retailer to become more competitive that way consumer will send the clear signal to they that they will not pay extortionate price when give range of option to choose from we be confident that these measure will help facilitate competitive road fuel retail market increase price transparency and protect consumer interest thank hon friend again for secure this important debate question put and agree to house adjourn
