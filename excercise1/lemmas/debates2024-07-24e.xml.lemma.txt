redevelopment of casement park the government be commit to ensure that euro benefit the whole of the united kingdom we be work as quickly as possible with all partner to assess the option on the casement park project many people be surprised when the secretary of state on first be appoint make it his priority to deliver on casement park commit million for stadium to host five match at time when there be huge waiting list to be deal with in the health service and with special educational need and social housing need funding be an indefensible use of public money can the secretary of state assure we that the government view have not be influence by any personal intervention by the chief of staff of the labour party for whom this be personal project and can he confirm that such an intervention would be breach of standard in public life would say to the right hon gentleman that say this be priority because decision need to be make the fact be that the government have inherit commitment to host the euros at casement park it be now year and three quarter since uefa award that right to northern ireland and to the united kingdom and ireland but nothing have happen during the year and three quarter since then to progress the project we be leave with situation in which the cost have go through the roof and even if we have the money we do not know if we could build it in

citizen of northern ireland who await out patient appointment and to the who await in patient admission why in the government view it seem to be priority to pour hundred of million of pound into gaa sport stadium instead of fix our health service if the government commit money and the euros do not come to belfast will the government not be in position in which the rugby stadium and the football stadium do not get penny of treasury or northern ireland office money but the gaa do how could that be fair and how could that be proportionate hope very much that sport will be force for unity in

prime minister and the leader of the opposition for their supportive policy in relation to ukraine their expression today will have be of great comfort to the thousand of ukrainian resident in the united kingdom who simply wish to return to their lawful home far to the answer to my hon friend the member for broxbourne lewis cocking can the prime minister tell the house how his planning reform

sustainability thank the right hon gentleman for that question we have to get economic growth in this country we have have failure over the last year to build the infrastructure the house and the

the previous government for someone to be over the age of before they can get secure roof of their own over their head be huge dashing of dream interruption we be not go to listen to the conservatives they put their case to the electorate and the electorate reject they profoundly have stand at the opposition dispatch box for four and half long year my advice be that when you get reject that profoundly by the electorate it be good not to go back to they and tell they that they be wrong it be good to reflect and change your approach and your party point of order on point of order mr speaker in his question to the prime minister the newly elect hon member for chipping barnet dan tomlinson make what be be sure be certain an inadvertent inaccuracy in his claim about the funding of the metropolitan police which be the well fund force both in absolute term and per capita the mayor of london be offer million with which to fund it which he fail to use because of lack of recruitment my broad point be whether advice can be give to new and indeed return member about how to correct the record when they make an erroneous claim on the floor of the house first the right hon gentleman

not minister but be for three year will the minister give way as the right hon gentleman have so much experience on the defence committee be happy to take his point thank the minister for give way she be foreign office minister head this up believe not defence minister which be interesting but it be an international agreement can she tell the house whether because of the threat to the programme from the defence review she have have any representation from the japanese government or the italian government our two other major programme partner to express their concern about any threat to gcap the right hon gentleman ask an important question can confirm that this be the legal framework around which the programme will sit can also confirm that the defence secretary yesterday meet with his japanese counterpart at the show and they be able to have far interesting discussion the right hon gentleman will be able to continue his questioning when he be surely once again member of the defence committee in the autumn many job in our constituency depend on contract with the kingdom of saudi arabia which be also interested in gcap what conversation have be have with saudi arabia particularly in the light of the procrastination by the prime minister on this programme reaffirm if be honest by the minister today in her remark the right hon member ask an important question but there have be no procrastination within month of be elect we have get the legal framework to the house of commons for debate expedite all the important organisational arrangement so that the programme can proceed at pace he talk of procrastination and after year be sure he be master of procrastination as part of the last government the privilege and immunity confer on agency personnel and representative be not

force defence industry on global stage through the gigo the uk will lead on the development of an innovative stealth fighter jet with supersonic capability and equip with cutting edge technology and facilitate collaboration with key international partner that raise the profile of the uk combat air industrial capacity there be much to be welcome in the minister speech at the very beginning she refer to number of aircraft company that will be involve across the whole of the united kingdom my understanding maybe she can confirm this be that spirit aerosystems will also be involve if that be the case it mean that everybody in this great united kingdom of great and britain and northern ireland will benefit from the job and opportunity obviously the specific of the supply chain and so on be not really part of the order but we be aware that that be an important part of our industrial puzzle and be sure that there will be some knock on benefit for northern ireland the hon gentleman be fierce defender of job and opportunity in that wonderful place the first duty of government be to keep the country safe under this government defence will be central both to the uk security and to our economic prosperity and growth include by harness the strength of our well establish defence industry the gigo be key to gcap and the uk government continue to make positive progress with our partner japan and italy commend the order to the house call the shadow secretary of state for defence may associate the shadow defence team with the remark from the prime minister and leader of the opposition about the terrible attack on british solider in kent our thought be with his family can confirm that we support the measure before we and recognise that they be necessary to deliver into law the administrative governance of the global combat air programme although this be foreign office measure the statutory instrument be prepare with strong input from the ministry of defence it certainly cross my desk when be minister for defence procurement may put on the record that it be great honour to serve in that role with significant responsibility in relation to gcap alongside the two previous secretaries of state ben wallace and grant shapps it be privilege to engage with our international gcap partner from italy and japan whom have the pleasure of host last september in lancaster house for trilateral discussion this be not just about deliver uk military capability in the crucial area of combat air but about do so to the benefit of two great partner and in the case of japan one that face the threat of china and russia right on its doorstep since that trilateral the project have achieve significant goal not least the signing of the international treaty last december that we be legislate for today the treaty establish the legal basis for the formation of new gcap international organisation the gigo be delighted that we be able to agree that the international hq of the gigo will be in the uk but that in keep with the spirit of equal partnership that underpin gcap the first chief executive of the gcap agency and joint venture be from italy and japan as such the si before we effectively enable this international treaty to enter into effect with further important measure on immunity and privilege that be necessary for the effective operation of the gigo all that say although the si be necessary to deliver gcap governance arrangement it will not directly deliver single aircraft alongside this si we need the government to back the gcap programme wholeheartedly by ensure that it have the funding necessary to deliver our sixth generation fighter capability indeed it would be quite extraordinary for the government to ask we as house to approve the regulation if they be at the same time seriously contemplate scrap uk involvement in gcap yet that prospect have figure prominently in the press in recent day while the good of british defence aviation have be gather at the royal international air tattoo and farnborough incredibly the government have not be able to repeat the wholehearte backing of gcap that they give prior to the general election in respond to the statement from his predecessor grant shapps on december last year when he confirm the trilateral agreement for the gcap treaty the now defence secretary say develop sixth generation fighter will ensure that we can continue to safeguard our uk sky and those of our nato ally for decade to come it will inspire innovation strengthen uk industry and keep britain at the cutting edge of defence technology totally agree with his remark yet fast forward to the present and as we have just hear at prime minister question the prime minister be only able to say that the programme be important meanwhile the minister for the armed forces the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard who be on the front bench and for whom have great personal respect say it be not right for to prejudge what might happen in the defence review he thus imply that the defence review might not continue the uk commitment to gcap we now need clarity from the government for parliament industry and our international partner we be be ask to approve this si to deliver key step stone to the gcap project so be the government still commit to it this be my guess about what be currently happen would be truly stagger if the government be to withdraw from programme that they have previously give such full support not because theirs be party that do not know good turn but because it would bring international ramification that do not bear think about either for the foreign office or the ministry of defence rather in my view we need to have in mind another department one that have also have the pleasure of serve in the treasury suspect that the overall question of whether the government be commit to gcap be red herring what really matter be whether they be commit to fund it this year with important spending decision to be make right now they will be in the inbox of the secretary of state under funding decision on gcap we want the government to continue that funding in the year beyond and we want to know whether they be use the review as chance to shift spending decision to the right it be not unprecedented in the history of the treasury for it to work in that way under successive government probably it might offer illusory short term saving but it would cause immediate and lasting pain to the most important conventional defence programme of our time to be clear and mean this have the great respect for the way the treasury have to balance the book and be responsible for the nation finance be delighted that the previous government propose move to once it be affordable we be prepared to make difficult decision to fund that by reduce the size of the civil service to pre pandemic level and once it be sustainable far from this government inherit what the chief secretary to the treasury have describe as the bad economic inheritance since world war two we do what we promise and move to only once the economic condition allow namely when inflation be back to target with healthy economic growth and deficit head towards little over over the forecast period that be our clear pathway to versus labour uncertainty and delay which make the real difference to understand the direct short term importance of and its relevance to gcap and this statutory instrument we need only go back to what the secretary of state say the response to the statement from his predecessor grant shapps in december he say this month the national audit office report on the mod equipment plan it expose billion black hole in britain defence plan and show that ministers have lose control of the defence budget official report december vol it be not so much that we lose control of the defence budget rather putin invade ukraine and send inflation soar all around the world in world that be then in rush to rearm that context cause an inevitable hit to the cost of major defence project and matériel have never pretend otherwise bear in mind that the equipment plan the mod forward inventory account for over year the nao assessment of black hole do not take account of one thing move to by as say in my wind up to the thursday debate on the gracious speech by set out fully cost and clearly timetable pathway to we be able to deal with those funding pressure head on and ensure that our large two programme the nuclear deterrent and gcap would be stabilise and as result properly fund into the future ask the foreign office minister who respond to my to confirm that the government timetable would not put funding of either programme at risk there be no answer and we have have no answer today either that be the problem the government can afford to bring forward this si and to continue build the administrative apparatus for gcap but we fear that they can not afford to approve the funding requirement for the next stage of build the actual aircraft because of their vacillation on reach we conservatives be clear that we support the si on the basis that we be also support gcap as whole include by put in place the funding necessary to deliver its requirement over the urgent timescale that all three member nation require that be key point for all three nation gcap be all about pace and timetable for the uk and italy that mean replace the typhoon before it be withdraw from service towards for japan with equal urgency it mean replace the mitsubishi that be why any delay or deferment whether cause by the lack of clear timetable to or otherwise be so important and critical overall it be my view that withdraw from gcap now would be the equivalent of scrap the spitfire programme in the it be that serious however if such an outcome be seriously under consideration and we know that there be those in government who be hugely sceptical will explain why we be ultimately support this si it be because we on the conservative benches believe that gcap be military necessity that will bring enormous economic and strategic benefit to the united kingdom to start with the military capability argument if there be one key lesson from ukraine it be that in the absence of air superiority we face the prospect of terrible attritional warfare with huge casualty reminiscent of the bad battle of world war two know it be think very far into the future but do my hon friend accept that one of the lesson from the ukraine conflict where we have have to give indirect support be the importance of maintain aircraft that we have withdraw from service in mothball if necessary so that they can be make available to ally should they ever face crisis such as this one when the happy day come that we have these great sixth generation aircraft can we be certain that we have not unduly dispose of their predecessor in case someone else need they in future my right hon friend question be an interesting one whenever be in front of the select committee it be always great joy and privilege to be cross examine particularly by my colleague on the conservative benches there be always debate about when we withdraw platform and when we bring in their replacement that will never go away and wish the armed forces minister well when he have the unique privilege and experience of go in front of the committee what would say to my right hon friend be that we have to accept that as matter of avionic reality the typhoon will reach the end of its service life and we as country have to replace it gcap be key to that with the construction of the new core platform while invest in the good combat air capability do not guarantee air superiority in the future it offer we the chance to deny adversary such potentially deadly freedom of operation by maintain technological competitiveness however there be those who ask why do we simply go off the shelf and buy more notice similar view be express in the daily telegraph this very day and there be even rumour that some government departments such as those mention early may take view along those line we must be clear that the while brilliant and highly capable aircraft be fifth generation platform not sixth generation one it be not optimise for the battle space that be likely to pertain by the late and the united states which after all possesse and manufacture the be itself invest in sixth generation programme as be our adversary commend the shadow minister for what he be say his great focus on the issue of modern technology our company and what they be involve with know that he have tremendous interest in northern ireland he visit there regularly in his former role in government can he give we some suggestion about the role that aerospace in northern ireland could and will play in find way forward be very grateful to the hon gentleman who be an absolute champion of the defence industry in northern ireland he be right one of my last visit be to the thales factory in belfast which of course be home to the next generation light anti tank weapon the lightweight multirole missile and other key munition in term of aerospace the first small and medium sized enterprise forum that hold as defence procurement minister be in larne in northern ireland on armed forces day last year spirit be one of the attendee and be confident that it have strong place in the future of british aviation in the defence sector as long as we put the funding in place and keep with the programme have say all that there must obviously be debate when we be spend this amount of money on capability and understand why there be those who question the sum of money involve the timeframe and so on to be clear as former defence procurement minister would not support programme that be purely about spend such vast amount of money just on new core platform to replace typhoon that bring we to what gcap be really about which the minister mention in her opening remark to her credit on one of my last visit to land company company manufacture armoured vehicle for this country the chief executive speak to refer to the gcap of land the point be that although the stand for air when we talk about gcap in military capability term it be equally about how we work with autonomous and uncrewed system that be the key to the sixth generation concept be very passionate about this issue be proud to bring forward the first defence drone strategy at the ministry of defence and although there be those who be concerned about the timeframe would just make the follow point first the timescale for deliver gcap be very ambitious compare with that of typhoon secondly we can gain capability benefit from gcap on much short timescale we have hear the chief of the general staff talk about the need for the army to be able to fight war within three year and when be defence procurement minister be keen to ensure that all the service be look at what they could do to boost lethality and survivability in the near term surely the key to that be how we make use of uncrewed system the united kingdom be incredibly well place in that regard we jointly lead the maritime coalition in respect of ukraine alongside norway of course ukraine great military success have be naval have push back the russian fleet use what we might describe as innovative weapon rather than traditional naval deployment likewise on land the incredible importance of drone can not be overstate include the psychological impact on those who be fight out there totally agree with what the former minister be say about the requirement for and necessity of sixth generation aircraft as well as about maintain sovereign capability however do he agree that it seem peculiar that the americans be develop their own sixth generation aircraft with lockheed martin the french and the germans be develop their own sixth generation aircraft as well and we have forge this strange partnership with the italians and the japanese to develop gcap do the minister think that make sense in term of pool effort and make sure that our ally have at least one good sixth generation fighter aircraft be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question but do not regard it as strange partnership all my experience of deal with gcap and meet my italian and japanese counterpart particularly industry representative from all three country and work so closely together there be already so much work go on tell that this be about develop brilliant platform that be need by all three nation there will always be multiplicity of platform from different country which think be perfectly healthy what be good about the hon gentleman question be that he have open up the debate about sovereign capability which will come to shortly just want to finish my point about the uncrewed domain and what it mean to be sixth generation before my hon friend do so would he give way very briefly of course it be pleasure my hon friend be very good defence procurement minister and we on the committee like he because crikey he actually answer the question he will know from that experience that even the americans who have new thing call the next generation air dominance fighter be struggle to afford it there have be medium report in the us that they may even cancel that programme because even the americans can not afford to do everything unilaterally anymore in the light of that do my hon friend believe that three way programme represent good value for money my right hon friend who not only serve on the committee but be an armed forces minister make an excellent point there be those who argue that we should go beyond would argue that be still significant jump for this country we have fund plan and that and critically with the pathway we set out which become an accumulation of significant additional billion of pound for the mod enable we to afford gcap and stabilise that programme want to make one crucial point about the uncrewed domain to be frank for the uncrewed side of the navy army and air force those programme be not fund hitherto the funding have come primarily from support for ukraine that be entirely logical because under the defence drone strategy we be very clear that there be no point in the army for example order large scale drone now it might order they to train with but the technology be change so fast what we as country need to build as set out in the drone strategy be the ecosystem to develop those drone and we be do that have always say say it during my statement on the integrate procurement model that my most inspiring moment as defence procurement minister be visit uk sme that be build drone for use in ukraine it be highly capable platform but brilliantly it be get feedback and spiral it as we call it the very next day on gcap it should be technology for the whole of defence it should be pan defence technology of how we team with uncrewed system how the navy fight with an uncrewed fleet above and below the surface for the army and of course for the air force have two final point on military capability as couple of point have be float around in the press the first be that the army be put out its opposition to gcap find that idea impossible to believe of course if the army want to succeed it need the support of the air force and so on that be why an integrated approach to procurement be so important not single service competition there have also be the point that we should choose between gcap and aukus as if when the next war come the russians will step into our dressing room and ask if we would like to bowl or bat would we like to fight on land or sea what be our preference the fact be that we do not know where the threat will come from but we know that it be grow so we should support both gcap and aukus not least for the enormous economic benefit they bring you will be pleased to know mr speaker that that bring to the last part of my speech on the economic benefit of gcap there be those who say we should buy off the shelf we would stress how in state of ever great war readiness it pay to have operational independence and sovereignty in particular invest in the great tradition of uk combat air offer huge economic gain for every part of the country in pricewaterhousecoopers estimate that the tempest programme alone would support an average of job every year from until those be well pay job in every constituency up and down the country include many in lancashire as you will know mr speaker scrap gcap would hit our economy hard even delay or defer gcap expenditure would undermine our brilliant aerospace industry which be on display this past week at the royal international air tattoo in farnborough and cast doubt over the vast sum of private investment that be wait from which hundred of uk sme stand to benefit an interesting point be raise by the leader of the opposition when ask the prime minister about export and discussion with the kingdom of saudi arabia it be an incredibly important point be clear that in reform procurement we have to have exportability at the heart of it because otherwise industrial supply chain wither it be as simple as that the demand from this country be not big enough this have be the french lesson for many year which be why they have put so much effort into export and we need to do the same whether it be gcap or any other platform or capability manufacture by the united kingdom to undermine gcap be to undermine our economy our future war fight capability and relation with our close international partner the government should instead embrace gcap wholeheartedly and confirm that they stand by their previous position of steadfast support then they should commit to clear timetable on so that we can turbocharge the programme by invest not only in the core platform but in the associated technology of autonomous collaboration and digital system of system approach enable the mass and rapid absorption of battlespace datum to conclude the good way to win the next war be to deter it from happen in the first place part of our overall deterrence posture be to signal to our adversary our preparedness to always be ready to out compete their technology how can we send that deterrent signal if we have such mixed message on our large conventional military programme we support this statutory instrument we support gcap and we support the powerful gain it will give to the united kingdom economic and military strength order can gently say that welcome the very thorough response from the opposition but the shadow minister do take twice as long as the minister do have other speaker on his own side who also want to get in so please just work to make sure we can get everybody in we now come to maiden speech call calvin bailey thank the shadow minister for his speech mr speaker thank you very much for give this opportunity to speak it appear that for once my sense of timing have be impeccable have complete year and seven month of service in the royal air force have arrive on time uniquely place as the only person who could sequence their maiden speech in amongst debate about military aircraft unfortunately as my hon friend the member for bootle peter dowd suggest in his riposte to the king speech will not be wear silk smoking jacket it be life of service to this house that also characterise my predecessor career loved politician john cryer give year of service to the constituency of leyton and wanstead and nine year as member for hornchurch before that he be fine parliamentarian and more importantly fine socialist like his mother and father before he his incredible commitment to the parliamentary labour party as its chair for the past nine year be instrumental in help we get to where we be today while he now move on to the other place be certain that his child and his family legacy will follow in his footstep in year to come this sentiment of service be something that resonate deeply with service be fundamental to who be and it be fundamental to the government and to my commitment to the wonderful constituency of leyton and wanstead be here because my constituent place their trust in trust for which be grateful and which will repay with service and commitment to ensure they be represent in this place to the full of my ability at the centre of my constituency be leytonstone at the heart of which be our beloved whipps cross hospital whipp have serve our constituency for year during which time its nhs staff quiet professional have give selflessly for those in need within our community yet this hospital be emblematic of year of fail tory commitment and lack of investment its rebuilding be central to my tenure as an mp leytonstone be also cradle for talent have be home to notable figure such as my namesake david bailey and cartrain and sport star jo fenn andros townsend and david beckham leytonstone be the home of raf pedigree of douglas webb dfm the front gunner in the famous dam buster raid and more lately of james sjoberg the officer command squadron leverage this rich heritage to inspire our youth and give they pathway to success be personal commitment of mine opportunity like these be scarce for young people like create similar pathway for our youth will be central to my service leytonstone be also home to one of the most financially deprive area in the country but it be spirited community that seek to heal itself community leadership from cann hall mosque ensure the provision to all local people of much need food bank and youth group similarly at st margaret with st columba other gather to preserve sense of community despite their obvious hardship community spirit be also strong in south woodford and wanstead if whipps be the heart of our constituency wanstead park be its lung and the river rode its vein wanstead park be part of our historic epping forest which be save by campaigner such as octavia hill founder of the national trust and the spirit of activism and preservation continue in the wanstead community gardeners the south woodford society and the ever popular wanstead fringe festival to the south be leyton home of leyton orient football club the and their trust embody the good of our community from their sacrifice in the pal regiment in the first world war to their work with waltham forest age uk they support our vulnerable veteran the club be also proud to celebrate our diverse community epitomise by laurie cunningham the club first black player his legacy continue to inspire as do the leadership of omar beckles in improve representation in football such leadership be reflective of the club leadership in the establishment of governance for our footballe world effort such as these be key to visible role model and leadership be essential for diverse community without these inspirational character young black people like will not see themselves in place of power reflect on the very low number of black man in our politic despite an increase in representation across all ethnic group address this be key to fix the inequality that face young people particularly in the area of knife crime pivotal moment in my upbringing be the murder of stephen lawrence while we be aware of the continue failure to provide justice to my friend stuart family we all know of the institutional failing that have lead to this want to point all member to number of thing surround this that be formative for first the absence of representation inhibit our ability to hear voice and understand the challenge face by other like we reflect during the campaign that when be young carry knife not because wish to attack anyone but because be scared and feel that the fate that have befall my friend brother could happen to and other like mistakenly assume that could look after myself similarly but sadly we know that be not the case and that those who carry knife be more likely to be kill themselves we need people like to translate those experience into policy secondly and in some way most importantly look back with great upset and anger on how this matter be politicise by extreme group our anger and upset be channel by populist who manipulate we for their own political end those voice be present in our house and vocal in our politic and we must challenge they openly to prevent those actor from foster anger hate and division within our community fear it be our great threat to democracy and we must be fundamental in our moderation we must challenge those behaviour without fear openly separate they from the underlie issue finally what see through that period in my life and through highly decorate fly career in the royal air force be the two thing value most first my friend and secondly my family my mother and father instill in the value and virtue of service and humanity my sister shape and help to see the world through the eye of woman my friend shepherd through school college and university and through every difficult challenge in my life but it be my wife who have support steadfastly through military career and grow our wonderful family love she deeply and will never be able to thank she enough the reason be here be my service not just as member of this house but to our nation in the raf have choose to speak in this debate because recall as young engineering student learning of the failing of the duncan sandys defence review which do deep and lasting damage to our aerospace industry and industrial base already we have hear voice state that our commitment to this programme be fallacy but acceptance of that be merely acceptance of failure to manage defence programme and the company contract to deliver they it be not gcap that be fallacy but the way we contract and manage such programme our interaction with defence prime must change we must encourage risk taking because without it there be no innovation we must not allow the customer to set the demand for technology that the customer itself can not conceive we must be government who well understand science and we need an industry that be incentivise with accountability we have the sixth large defence budget in the world we must get our money worth and we must make sure that our money lead to our security and not to excess corporate bonus for that reason the remark by the minister for the armed forces about the sanctity of the defence review be key we can not allow defence simply to be buy out of its overspend this be an exciting programme with two close and value partner and the government defence review be critical to it call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be an absolute honour to follow the hon and gallant member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey he have deliver an excellent maiden speech and it be an example to every new and old member of this house that he should set out his love and affection for the place where he live and where he have clearly spend many happy year it be obviously custom in this house to use the term honourable and gallant for somebody who have serve but in the case of the hon member it have particular resonance because he receive an mbe decade ago in recognition of meritorious gallant and distinguish service he make tremendous speech and the whole house will have hear he talk about the importance of new hospital to his constituency and about the scourge of knife crime and his own personal reflection on why young people carry knife we will all reflect on his thought and comment as he make they in the month and year to come welcome the minister of state to her place and congratulate she on her new role at the foreign commonwealth and development office give that she shadow that role for some time feel hopeful that she have good understanding of our partnership not just in europe but in east and south east asia and that they be safe with she on behalf of the liberal democrats welcome the government announcement that they remain committed to the global combat air programme also welcome the presence in the king speech of the strategic defence review reflect on the speech that we have just hear it be essential that we go through strategic defence review every time we have serious change of government as we have have after year it be encouraging to hear that the review will be publish soon within the first half of next year professor michael clarke point out that this be the defence review to have take place since the end of the cold war and that most have not be very strategic he say that most review have be cost cut exercise and that only couple of they could be describe as genuinely strategic he go on think this one have an ambition to be more genuinely strategic entirely agree with the hon gentleman analysis of past strategic defence review and particularly remember the sdr which be after labour landslide it be strategic and outlined concept that stand the test of time one reason for that be that it give other people the opportunity to contribute to the review be hop that labour ministers might pay little attention to the idea that if they want their strategic defence and security review to do well they should open up the process so that people on non partisan basis can have serious input to be delighted to see my friend the minister for the armed forces nod his agreement be grateful to the right hon member for that intervention and so far gather that the government be prepared to listen to external expertise be encourage to hear that fiona hill will be very much at the pinnacle of this review and know as an example that she have great deal of insight into matter europe and in particular in relation to russia the defence review will need to look not only at mean which be what we be discuss today but at end and way so that it come to think about mean only after think about end and way the problem with pre empte review and leap straight into talk about particular procurement programme be that it only serve at this stage at least to start to raise question about what programme have not be confirm so far in this the week of the farnborough airshow lot of question have be raise about gcap or tempest as the fighter aircraft will be know in the uk on saturday one headline warn raf jet may never get off the ground and on monday subheading read question be be ask about whether it should be scrap to save money on tuesday an opinion column warn the government silence over the future of the tempest fighter be deeply concern sometimes the question be not as simple as whether to spend but whether to spend in the near term or the long term or on procure equipment today or in the future there be trade off in combat power between the near term and the long term appreciate that the government will be seek to confirm to our ally that gcap will proceed and they will want to reassure italy and japan as well as offer reassurance to commercial partner those of we from the west country need look no far than yeovil to see what success leonardo have be for industry in our region defence export from yeovil amount to billion in month this issue clearly do matter great deal to uk industry but we must think about what else be happen in the commercial space we have hear about the european future combat air system scaf consortium make up of france germany and spain which be develop fighter jet in parallel urge the government to consider whether the two system can be as interoperable as possible the pyramid open system architecture that we anticipate will be part of gcap would do well to be able to speak with whatever the scaf come up with aside from gcap the strategic defence review should consider the uk exist capability and exist combat air in particular twenty six tranche typhoon fighter aircraft be due to be retire from service at the end of next march the option remain for those tranche aircraft to be bring up to the standard of tranche or tranche bae system provide the previous government with the structural and avionic modification that would be require but they choose not to take that up instead they intend to put the tranche aircraft on to so call reduce to produce programme to strip they of usable part for the typhoon fleet inventory of spare wonder whether consideration also could be give to whether they could become tranche or tranche aircraft instead an initial order of lightning aircraft have already be scale back to in part to release funding to gcap we can see that there be always trade off between think about future combat air in versus what we might need today upgrade the tranche fighter aircraft would grow the uk typhoon fleet from to of course they will not have the late air to ground capability of the and they certainly will not have the range payload or stealth capability that we will expect of gcap and tempest but they would be available soon in recent month we have see typhoon intercept russian long range maritime patrol bomber north of the shetland island within nato northern air policing area now do not seem to be the time to cannibalise typhoon tranche for spare part recall from my own service the phrase use in the armed force that we should deal with the crocodile near the boat in announce that gcap will go ahead trust that the defence review will also appraise those near term risk in our near abroad rather than simply carry on with exist programme because they be already in train in closing will pose three question to the ministerial team first be gcap still too link to the assumption about geopolitic from the integrated review be it take into full account the integrated review refresh of and particularly the russian invasion of ukraine secondly if there be to be parallel development of gcap and scaf by other european ally will the government reassure we that consideration be be give to interoperability such as in relation to open system architecture thirdly if there be not enough money in the pot to upgrade typhoon tranche buy more and develop gcap which of those three initiative be the uk unlikely to do call mark francois madam deputy speaker may begin by congratulate you on your election and welcome you to the chair be sure that you will chair our proceeding excellently we wish you all good luck may also thank the hon member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey for fine fluent and if may say so at time poignant maiden speech he speak well on behalf of his constituent have it on good authority that when my hon friend the member for south suffolk james cartlidge be the procurement minister the hon member take he on tour of brize norton and help to brief he on the my hon friend have ask to pass on his thank as former army officer may say to former raf officer what great pleasure it be to see the raf turn up on time there be indeed first time for everything laughter the purpose of the order be lay out clearly in paragraph of the explanatory memorandum which state that it give effect to the convention between the government of the italian republic the government of japan and the government of the united kingdom establish the global combat air programme international government organisation sign on december it point out that the convention be negotiate by the ministry of defence my third welcome be to the minister it be good to see she in her place however as the convention be nominate by the ministry of defence could she explain for clarity why the fcdo and not the mod be handle this statutory instrument the minister kindly nominate for place on the house of commons defence committee as today appear to be day for people take up nomination will gladly accept that and announce that be go to run for that committee also point out that in the explanatory memorandum the policy context for the order this be important be describe as follow in december the prime ministers of uk japan and italy launch gcap to deliver next generation aircraft by the signing of the gcap convention between the partner take place in december and be conduct by the respective defence secretaries of the three nation the gigo will function as the executive body with the legal capacity to place contract with industrial partner engage in the gcap so far so good the debate take on some additional resonance however because we now have defence review which some people have interpret as sword of damocles hang over this important programme my fourth welcome be to the new minister for the armed forces the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard who represent military constituency it be good to see he in his place too few minute ago at prime minister question the prime minister describe gcap as really important programme it be it be good that he be able to go to farnborough see the mock up of the aircraft for himself and receive briefing when serve on the defence committee in the last parliament in march we travel to japan to examine the programme as good we could from the japanese perspective we speak to politician civil servant industrialist and the japanese air self defence force its military we be go to write what believe would have be very positive report and then someone go and call general election we can not blame the minister for that but she and some of her colleague do somehow appear to benefit from it would like to stress three theme from that trip which come out strongly the first be the absolute unanimity of purpose among the japanese to deliver the programme as one politician put it to we we live in tough neighbourhood include three autocracy with nuclear weapon we need to strengthen our defence and this programme be fundamental to that think that be very good summary of the japanese perspective secondly we be strike by the willingness of the japanese to consider third party export of gcap to make the aircraft affordable by increase its production run my hon friend the member for south suffolk be always hot on that when he be the procurement minister for various historical reason do not think that the japanese would necessarily have take that view even few year ago that be important thirdly the japanese have an absolute determination to achieve the in service date of which be refer to directly in the memorandum the japanese air self defence force use mixture of eagle aircraft and the which be sort of soup up version of the american they be both good and capable aircraft but they be get rather long in the tooth the japanese have to plan forward against threat from the chinese or the russian the risk be that by the those aircraft will be outmatch by those two powerful new combat aircraft reference have be make to the it be fine aircraft but it be expensive to buy and very expensive to run the americans have find that to their cost the be nickname by the american medium the plane that eat the pentagon it might not necessarily be the answer to the treasury dream moreover for the record delivery of the to the united states force be suspend for nearly year they have only just be resume because of problem in upgrade the computer and the software if we be to talk about the reality the have be quite troubled programme and to some extent continue to be so what would be the implication of cancellation of gcap this be an international agreement and as it say in paragraph of the explanatory memorandum no external consultation be undertake as the instrument implement provision of an international agreement to which the united kingdom will be oblige to give effect as matter of international law once it enter into force the first implication be we to cancel it be that it would put back anglo japanese relation and anglo italian relation arguably for decade would not want to be the ceo of british company try to sell something to the japanese government in the aftermath of the cancellation of gcap secondly give the scale and the prominence of the programme there would be serious risk that we in the united kingdom would achieve reputation as an unreliable partner in major military collaborative programme everything from aukus through to collaboration in space in an era when thing such as sixth generation combat aircraft be so expensive that as intimate early even the americans be struggle to afford one on their own the reality for we as medium power be that we need to collaborate we would find it very difficult to find future partner if we suddenly cancel such an important and sizeable programme for financial reason thirdly it would make nonsense of the uk so call tilt to the pacific which be inherent to the so call integrate review and be reinforce when the review be refresh before the general election how can we tilt to the pacific if we then cancel major collaborative programme with critical pacific partner which face challenge from russia and china even more immediately than we do bluntly our name would be mud in that theatre of operation if we be to do that fourthly there be what one might call the prosperity agenda as they say in the king speech the government be very committed to growth let we not debate building and the green belt now but focus on this issue in the last few year about of the uk defence export have come from combat air mainly sale of typhoon or our workshare on the that have average roughly billion year again what would be the threat to our export and our reputation as reliable supplier if we be to cancel the programme what should we do the gigo which this memorandum establish will incorporate prominent representative from all three country the uk japan and italy and it will be headquarter here if the programme be to survive which strongly believe it should the gigo have vital role to play as the management organisation it will have to be lean and less bureaucratic than its predecessor organisation which oversee the tornado and typhoon programme two wonderful aircraft with proud heritage in the royal air force think everyone in the industry would admit that those organisation be bit too bureaucratic the gigo will have to be lot lean and mean to get the job do the principal industrial partner bae systems rolls royce mitsubishi heavy industries and leonardo among other will have real challenge historically the answer to such dilemma might have be look it very complicated programme it will take year to achieve and it all depend on how many country join how many aircraft they buy and what configuration they go for will the saudis participate will they want it build in the kingdom of saudi arabia if they do participate there be lot of imponderable so we will come back to you in about five year time with unit price that will not wash would submit that one of the first task of the gigo work with those industrial partner and the three government be to come up with at least realistic pricing envelope for the programme which the treasury can look at and hopefully take positive view on if they do not do that there can be no blank cheque even for this to conclude there be no such thing as an uncancellable defence programme although still hope for ajax but this come close to cancel this programme for short term financial reason would be disaster militarily politically diplomatically and industrially if it come down to gcap aukus or ajax for ajax have to go and say that as former soldier we need to understand how extremely serious the implication be of cancel this programme be soldier but the royal air force have proud tradition in the defence of this country and its interest go back to the battle of britain and the first world war when it grow out of the army hasten to say and the navy and the navy in which my father serve for completeness the royal air force need this aircraft we need it the japanese the italians and the west need it by all mean let we control the cost but let we keep it we be not go to scrap the spitfire of the future it be great pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker look forward to you extend your authority to unruly fourth party even if they be new to that role welcome this statutory instrument which give effect to the convention on the establishment of gcap gcap be not important but vital to range of different priority to which urge the new government to pay very close attention it be vital to the united kingdom ability to play its role in defend our value against peer or near peer adversary and the threat that they present to our way of life we will not do that in the very near future if we can not command sixth generation capability it be vital to develop and maintain sovereign air capability if we have no legacy of manufacture complex combat air system we could not start it that enterprise can not be begin from nothing the flipside of that inevitable truth be that if we neglect what we have develop at great cost to the public purse over the past year we defeat the legacy of world lead extraordinary aircraft civil and military that have come out of the united kingdom over the past year we also create an extraordinary gap in our ability to defend the realm the first duty of any government the programme be vital for the stakeholder in the uk alone who have be engage with gcap to date and it have not even get up to speed yet those be just few element of why this be vital in geographical sense it be extraordinarily important to defence manufacturer in the central belt of scotland and the north west of england but see no reason to disbelieve the claim that it have positive effect for constituency all across the united kingdom seek to impress on the minister for the armed forces who know get it and be glad that he be here today that he should challenge any rise in treasury dogma when it come to gcap it be an opportunity for the united kingdom to repeat the world lead performance of harrier and the blackburn buccaneer the extraordinary capability of the panavia tornado and the exceptional ability of the bae typhoon that be what it can do what it expressly must not do be repeat the incredibly self defeat cost to the public purse and defence capability of the fiasco in the unfortunately an incoming labour government scrap that at huge cost to our defence capability and huge cost to the public purse it be demonstrable exercise in treasury obsess with the price of everything and myopic about the value of everything repeat in case sound political that know the minister for the armed forces get it we trust he to do the right thing the hon gentleman be quite right to highlight what happen to which be generation ahead of its time and world beater it be scrap because the treasury want to buy the instead which be an american aircraft and then it do not end up buy it there be lesson from history there too be there not if we take as the united kingdom have an extraordinarily complex programme somewhere down the road then the opportunity cost much less the financial and operability cost of turn back on that must be well set out be afraid that those be the detail the treasury have history of not be that interested in it be more focused on the number at the bottom right hand side of the balance sheet but this be far too important to yield to that level of priority it be much to be regret that the future combat air system and gcap be proceed in the european theatre in parallel that be grossly expensive duplication greatly fear that there be nothing we can do about it now nevertheless it be much to be regret be not certain that the partner in the compete french lead fcas programme will be happy partner throughout but that remain to be see the minister for the armed forces must ensure that the door be leave open for any latecomer or laggard who want to get on board with gcap would appreciate his assurance either today or at later date on that willing acceptability and acceptance as it be foreign commonwealth and development office minister who be lead today let say that the one thing the extraordinary aircraft list do not enjoy be particularly healthy export success gcap must have exceptional export success because quite apart from the standard avionic engine and air frame that we have to deal with in conventional traditional aircraft this aircraft be breed apart in term of its electronic warfare capability it be combat system which happen to be in an aircraft that be extraordinarily expensive if the price of that be leave to the italians the uk and the japanese we will face no small measure of difficulty on the statutory instrument itself article of the convention make provision for host country experience serious balance of payment issue draw member attention to the sovereign debt liability of both japan and italy and the uk itself although it would be the third of that list but the convention merely seek to inform the minister to consult in such circumstance it would be appreciate if we could know what type of consultation that would involve far article clarify that fund from each party will be set out in further arrangement however the convention do set out that the steering committee will have equal representation from each of the party how will the convention decide what the funding will be base on will it be base on order or on the number of national employee employ in the steering committee how will that work it be unclear in closing leonardo in edinburgh be the brain and nerve centre of gcap it be the central nervous system of this world lead capability the system be be design and finalise in edinburgh and it will be build in edinburgh at leonardo that bring on to the final provision in the si which state that the headquarters of gigo will be establish at later date but that it will be in the uk it be really important that wherever it be establish it have close connectivity with the key prime manufacturer of gcap rolls royce thales bae and leonardo it must be in part of this island where an outstanding quality of life can be enjoy with access to good school good quality of life transport infrastructure an international airport and good link with london that place be edinburgh congratulate you madam deputy speaker on your victory you will be brilliant and look forward to serve under your chairmanship in the three or four year ahead may say how very much support the statutory instrument do not support the prime minister lukewarm word at farnborough think the concern we have on the conservative benches be to do with the hare he set run not by what he say but by what do not say my advice to ministers would be for goodness sake up the rhetoric around this no government in their right mind would cancel this project this project be not only essential to our defence it be the bridge to the unmanned future of defence that will come by mid century kick away that bridge and we be leave with very little we undermine fundamentally the defence of these island we destroy the reputation of this country not just with the japanese and the italians but with practically any partner in defence present and future that we can imagine not least the saudis and it mean that we will not be able to successfully translate our defence industrial base to the future which we all appreciate be largely unmanned in each of the four domain that defence these day have to consider word mean what word say except when they trip from the lip of politician then it be very often what be not say that influence the conversation particularly in the medium my plea in the very short time available to be for ministers senior ministers and the prime minister to correct what be say this week and in particular to ramp up the rhetoric on our support for this fundamentally important programme that be vital to our defence and our defence base appreciate that the prime minister have problem in that he have fail to commit to of gdp within recognisable timeframe which be no commitment at all and he have launch largely unnecessary defence review which will be distraction for at least month be confident in the sound good sense of lord robertson and richard barrons can not image that they will be party to the cancellation or delay of this programme call the minister to respond thank you very much madam deputy speaker congratulate you on behalf of the government on your accession to the throne not literally but to the speaker chair which be actually gift of the country of australia to the house of commons follow the thank my opposite number the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge in particular for his comment regard the dreadful attack on soldier outside the kent barrack this week thank he for put that on the record also thank all member across the house for support the si without vote will conclude briefly on some of the very important point that have be raise if do not cover they all it be because will be send copy of hansard to those in charge of the review include the minister for the armed forces my hon friend the member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard all the point that have be raise be crucial in think through the next five year of defence spending as say at the beginning this debate be about the international treaty part of the programme so will be very brief first of all thank the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois for his recommendation from his visit to japan there be nothing like visit country and get to know the whole team there to give really good feedback so will be pass that on we also have very supportive comment from the hon member for strangford jim shannon there be big plea from edinburgh by the snp spokesperson the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan for some defence job that have be hear praise fulsomely the maiden speech by my hon friend the member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey he have enormously big shoe to fill our friend have leave the green benches and will probably go the red benches at some future point who he have very big shoe to fill perhaps his predecessor have already be ennoble love my hon friend description of grow up with the challenge of knife crime and how he come through that what an excellent role model he be for so many people who be watch our debate today also admire his commitment to value for money that could prove very useful give his particular area of interest question arise in the debate relate to the role of other partner the order name the united kingdom japan and italy because we need to get on with this we be the first to deal with this at this level in our parliamentary process japan and italy will then engage in their own process because of the reciprocity involve and be sure that after that when we be all up to speed discussion about further partnership will be ongoing in grant these privilege and immunity we will be able to bring the gigo into force and in do so we will be well position to support the achievement of gcap aim and the fulfilment of the government objective we will also be well place to work with international partner and to influence the air combat industry as result hope that the house will support the order question put and agree to resolve that the draft global combat air programme international government organisation immunities and privileges order which be lay before this house on may in the last session of parliament be approve education and opportunity beg to move that this house have consider education and opportunity it be pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker and congratulate you on your election be grateful for the opportunity to speak about the labour government mission to break down the barrier to opportunity we be bring change to this nation however know that any change we deliver will be bring about in partnership with our wonderful workforce so let take this opportunity at the end of the academic year to thank they for all that they do for our child our young people and our country let begin by say two thing first welcome my new opposite number the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds to his place in the previous government he stand out for his commitment to his brief his passion and dedication and the collegiate and effective way in which he work with colleague in all part of the house we have disagree on many thing and be sure that we will go on to disagree on many thing but hope that whenever we can we will work together to build country where child come first secondly want to make an announcement here and now because our mission be urgent be pleased to announce that the department will undertake short pause and review of qualification reform at level and below conclude before the end of the year this mean that the defunding schedule for next week will be pause the come year will see further development in the roll out of new level which will ensure that young people continue to benefit from high quality technical qualification that help they to thrive will update the house with more detail tomorrow welcome the secretary of state announcement know it will also be welcome by college throughout the country teacher in my constituency like teacher everywhere else do an extraordinary job in support our young people but it be vital for they to be pay properly for it can the secretary of state update we on the work of the independent pay body and the government response to it we take the work of the pay review body extremely seriously but the previous government do not act responsibly in that regard they sit on the report and then they call an election understand the frustration that school leader and teacher be experience but as my hon friend know we be move as quickly as we can on this important issue and the chancellor will set out our position before the end of the month we understand the importance of get this right let reiterate once more our thank to our brilliant teacher and support staff for their work during this academic year we be put education back where it belong at the heart of change after year at the margin under the conservatives after year of ministerial merry go round after year of opportunity for our child be treat as an afterthought education be back at the forefront of national life know the power of education to transform life because live it standard be my story and now want standard to be the story for every child in the country not just in some of our school but in all our school want high and rise standard for each and every child but for long year that have not be the story in our education system think often of child bear in the month after the labour party last win an election some year ago they enter school in september in the first autumn in which conservative members serve as ministers by then the damage have already begin labour ambitious building schools for the future programme have already be cancel and that be store up problem for the decade ahead as the year go by those child see opportunity strip away they see not just resource drain from their childhood but also hope they see the child centre they have attend be close by the hundred they see fall investment in the school building in which they learn and in the staff who teach and support they they see change in the support for child with special educational need situation that in moment of unusual candour my predecessor the former mp for chichester describe as lose lose lose though she do almost nothing about it generation of child in social care be fall far and far out of sight my right hon friend have mention the inequality experience by child with special educational need and disability what be she able to say about what we will do and the difference that we will make to their life recognise the concern express by my hon friend and by member throughout the house about that important issue will say more about it later in my speech but let say now that not for second do underestimate the challenge that we face give my hon friend this commitment want to ensure that we deliver well system for child family and school one that be long way from the broken and adversarial system that too many people experience at the moment young people in unregistered school be miss out on not just the education but the childhood that they should have have and as that generation grow old the government response to once in lifetime pandemic make it clear to they that they be quite simply an afterthought pub be reopen to punter before school welcome back child examination grading be first farce and then fiasco we have government who forget almost altogether about further education and see apprenticeship start tumble year after year early this month the people of this country turn the page on that government and that era they turn to labour and to the hope which drive we and so many who work in education that tomorrow can be well than today and that our good day lie not behind we but ahead of we they turn to labour in the belief today distinctively labour belief that the role of government be not merely to administer but to transform and to deliver for all our child the freedom to achieve thrive succeed and flourish which have be withhold from so many of they for so long the secretary of state have talk about turn page and about opportunity she will be aware that young people today have few opportunity than our generation enjoy owe to disastrous tory policy that remove their freedom of movement as well as erasmus which include apprenticeship will she turn the page on that disastrous tory policy can tell the hon gentleman that welcome the opportunity to meet my opposite number in scotland recently and want to find area on which we can reach agreement constructively and collaboratively as for his specific question be afraid can not give he that commitment but want to ensure that all young people have the chance to travel learn and study the hope that want for our young people come from the opportunity that this government will deliver as member know opportunity be journey that last lifetime and the first step be in early year education because the barrier to opportunity appear early in child life we will bring about sea change in our early year system begin right now be fully committed to roll out the childcare entitlement promise to parent but need to be frank with the house the challenge be considerable and the last government do not have proper plan the irresponsibility that we inherit be shocking act immediately to get to grip with the task at hand but must be honest the disparity across the country be severe which mean that some parent will sadly miss out on their first choice place they and their child deserve well and be determined to get this right we will create nursery in primary school to well connect early year with our wide education system by the time we be do we will have thriving child strong family and parent who be able to work the hour they want the foundation for love of learn be lay early in primary school but child poverty put up barrier at every turn it be scar on our society the need to eradicate child poverty be why come into politic and it be why the prime minister have appoint and the work and pensions secretary to jointly lead the new child poverty taskforce together we will set out an ambitious child poverty strategy and will introduce free breakfast club in every primary school they be about more than just breakfast they be important for drive up standard improve behaviour increase attendance and boost achievement what child be teach once they be in the classroom matter too we must start early with math and inspire love of number in our young learner and this government be commit to fully evidence base early language intervention in primary school so that all child can find their voice want high and rise standard across all our school and for all our child but mean that in the broad and most ambitious of term we should be grow love of learning and encourage child to explore the world around they to be bold to dream and to discover their power our curriculum must reflect that that be why have announce the government expert lead review of the curriculum and assessment at all key stage in order to support our child and young people so that they succeed tomorrow and thrive today by work with teacher parent and employer we will deliver framework for learn that be innovative inclusive supportive and challenging that drive up standard in our school and ensure that every child have access to broad and rich curriculum however any curriculum be only as strong as the teacher who teach it today those teacher be leave the classroom not in drib and drab but in their drove and too often opportunity follow they out the door be work tirelessly to turn that around we will back our teacher and support staff and we will partner with the profession to ensure that workload be manageable we have already begin recruit more expert teacher together we will restore teaching as the career of choice for our very good graduate and we will invest in our school and service by end the tax break that private school enjoy accountability be vital and non negotiable but ofsted must change and change it will our reform will start with end one word judgment we will bring in new report card system that be part of our plan to support school and challenge they when need in order to deliver high and rise standard for every child have speak to colleague from across the house about their concern about how the system be fail learner with special educational need and disability share those concern the system be break be delighted to see on the government bench my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes with whom work so closely on this issue in opposition and who share entirely my focus and concern all family want the good for their child but parent of child with special educational need often face slow struggle to get the right support they be bogge down by bureaucracy and an adversarial system and entangle by complexity it be not good enough and we will work relentlessly to put that right we be committed to take community wide approach in which we improve inclusivity and expertise in mainstream school as well as ensure that special school cater to those with the most complex need have already restructure my department to start deliver on this commitment there can be no goal more important and more urgent than extend opportunity to our most vulnerable child which also mean reform child social care young people and adult deserve high quality route to build the skill that they need to seize opportunity and business need staff with the skill to help they grow those be two side of the same coin and the key to our future prosperity and growth we need skill system fit for the future but we have fragmented system that frustrate business let down learner and grind growth into the ground it be time for comprehensive strategy and for our country to take skill seriously so this week alongside the prime minister announce skills england new body that will unify the fractured landscape it will bring together central government combine authority business training provider union and expert business have tell we that they need more flexibility to deliver the training that work for they so we will introduce new growth and skill levy to replace the fail apprenticeship levy education be all about give learner the power to make choice that be right for they for many that choice will be university and be immensely proud of our world lead university they be shin light of learning but their future have be leave in darkness for too long this must and will change there will be no more talk down our country strong export under this government university will be value as public good not treat as political battleground we will move decisively to establish certainty and sustainability secure our university as engine of growth excellence and opportunity this government will break the link between background and success we will create opportunity for child and learner to succeed we will give they the freedom to chase their ambition and the freedom to hope this labour government be return hope to our country after long year and there can be no great work than build country where background be no barrier to opportunity that work of change have already begin call the shadow secretary of state madam deputy speaker may first welcome you to the big chair on behalf of the opposition it be great to see you there and may you have much success we will no doubt all enjoy serve under you may also welcome the secretary of state and her entire team to their place they have among the most important job in government and without doubt the good job in government while their colleague will be out visit wind turbine and distribution shed they will be spend time with child and the inspirational adult who teach they which be much well way to spend day although we have our difference we do not for moment doubt the ministerial team commitment to this crucial endeavour and our exchange across the dispatch boxes will always be in the spirit of seek the very good for child and for our society and country we want the government to succeed because the success of the british government be the success of britain that be true in every discipline but it be especially true in education where the effect of what happen be feel for many year to come and over the course of multiple change of government we will scrutinise and hold they to account as they know but we will also support they where they look to build on what have be achieve listen to the secretary of state be wonder from which country or era she be draw her material because what have be achieve be that we now have nine in school in this country rat good or outstanding up from just over two third when there be last change of government with more teacher more teaching assistant major upgrade in technical and vocational education through level high level technical and reform apprenticeship with employer set standard minimum length week and minimum off the job training time we have also be rise up the international result table at secondary school england young people have rise from in the world to in mathematic and from to in reading at primary school england child be the good reader in the western world do the shadow education secretary accept the institute for fiscal studies recent report it say that although we have see an improvement in average attainment there remain educational inequality particularly for child on free school meal child from ethnic minority background and disabled child we have not see any improvement and the educational inequality be stark the hon lady as ever make important point it be the mission of conservative governments from onwards always to pursue two goal first to raise attainment overall and secondly to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor between the advantaged and the disadvantaged or those with particular need although those gap be still too big there be decade of progress as she know think the ifs report that she mention will almost certainly have say that there be decade of progress right up until covid be afraid that covid strike labour members may shake their head but believe covid strike blow to education right throughout the world include in our country and there be yet think my point stand there be yet more work to do the point be make before the hon lady make her important intervention be that great deal have be achieve but there be still challenge in the aftermath of covid we know that there be particular challenge on the attainment gap and attendance by the way those two thing be relate but great deal have be achieve so my ask of the government be that while we acknowledge that they have just win the election with big majority we nevertheless ask they to be mindful and careful not to change thing just because they can of course minister do not educate child it be the teacher who educate child and those great achievement be their achievement but teacher exist within framework and system there be dedicated teacher not just in england but in scotland and wales but in those two country we have not see the same advance that we have see in england indeed in wales with labour administration run education we have see decline we have long have dedicate teacher in england too but the fact be that in the labour year before england result actually decline relative to other country even though some labour members may remember this in new labour target rich but be afraid highly gameable environment it be make to look like the result be all get well first may congratulate you on your appointment madam deputy speaker far to the point that the right hon gentleman have just make think it be fair to boast that scottish education use to be the envy of the world yet we now have so many staff vacancy in four of our highland secondary school ullapool kinlochbervie farr and gairloch that the kid simply be not be teach what they ought to be teach and be have to rely in some case on online learning which be scarcely satisfactory that be why the parent have band together to form the save our rural schools campaign be that not damn comment on the scottish government delivery of education north of the border as ever the hon gentleman make an important point incisively and speak up powerfully for rural community he be here the other night talk about rural health service and the challenge that they face but this be already go to be wide range debate and think might try your patience madam deputy speaker if we move into debate about the scottish education system and the snp administration much as he and would relish that opportunity however he be quite right to say that scottish education have have massive historical strength but have be let down by the snp administration when politician on the left talk about progressive agenda in education understand how that can sound beguiling and benign but we must not forget that the legacy of the last labour government be for england to be the only country in the developed world where the generation approach retirement be more literate and numerate than the young adult just enter the workforce and those who have just go through their education under new labour but that be the past and this team and this government will be assess and judge on the present and the future will the right hon gentleman give way at the risk of widen the debate will very briefly give way to the hon gentleman hope the right hon gentleman will welcome the scottish success in have more child and student go on to positive destination after school do he also acknowledge the damage that have be do by year and year of tory austerity and by remove the right and opportunity we have through freedom of movement follow our withdrawal from the eu which accord to labour figure have cost billion he should have some reflection on his own record admire the hon gentleman ability to turn everything into discussion about europe but have to tell he there be other thing at play if be an snp politician would not come to the floor of this house boast about the record of the snp government give their woeful performance on behalf of underprivileged child in scotland nor by the way would be complain about the finance when the scottish government be well finance for the thing that they should and must do until recently it be we sit on the government benches make these point but now it will be labour members this be debate about opportunity and the point of great leverage in spread opportunity be what happen in the very early year as the secretary of state say since we have have five major extension in early year and childcare entitlement and sixth be now on its way think hear the secretary of state say that she be commit fully to our plan in each of its phase unless she correct now that be certainly how will interpret it she then go on to say there be some difficulty and so can assure the secretary of state who speak from sedentary position that there be indeed such plan and we look now to the government to see that plan through would also like to hear from her colleague the minister of state department for education the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell when she sum up about the nursery to be establish in primary school it be important for we to know what proportion of those she expect to be full time year round nursery as oppose to term time only we know that however much time young child spend in nursery or in childcare they will spend more time at home and the social mobility literature be clear that what happen at home make big difference to opportunity later in life this be difficult area for government and require great care but hope that this new government will look to build on the home learn environment programme hungry little minds that we put in place and then reprise during covid and do so in supportive and non invasive way also hope that the government will continue with the family hub recognise that while they be vital for the to age group many issue go on right through childhood and adolescence the support family programme be actually cross party story because it be bring in during the cameron government from follow pilot under the previous labour government with its key worker approach it have so much potential and it now cover family not the original bring it into the department for education present great opportunity for the secretary of state and hope she will make the most of it in school the success story we have be discuss which can be see in the result in the programme for international student assessment the progress in international reading literacy study and other study have be base on three leg of stool the first be school autonomy with transparency and accountability the second be knowledge rich curriculum and prove learn method such as phonic and math mastery with the education endowment foundation evaluate and accredit programme the third be the spreading of good practice through academy trust and through school learn laterally from other school with teacher learn from teacher rather than thing be impose top down through nationwide network of hub in key subject and in key area such as behaviour it be not yet clear exactly what the new government plan be in each of those three area but if they seek to undo what have work and what do work we will argue the counter case robustly the government have as the secretary of state say announce review of the curriculum as of course they can and as we do in the past but again would urge they to reflect on what have work and what do work and in particular not to see conflict between skill and knowledge clearly when child be grow up develop and be educate they need both but it be through have depth of knowledge that they well develop skill as to what knowledge hope the review will also acknowledge that strength of our national curriculum be that unlike what lot of people think it be not in fact detailed specification of everything pupil will learn in history or literature rather it be framework that guard against political interference and that be principle that absolutely must be maintain hope that labour do learn the lesson of the literacy hour and the numeracy hour that seek to set out to school in or minute segment exactly what should be teach to child be bad idea with capital and capital on behaviour calm and ordered environment be basic requirement for learn and that be what child tell we they want of course no one want pupil to be suspend still less expel but that option need to be available as last resort yes we must think of the child wellbee but we also need to think of the wellbeing and life chance of the other child in the class have school leader in the drive seat be essential but that also bring need for transparency so we can see whether child in some area be not get as strong an education as child in other progress which we bring in measure the progress of all child equally and be far well than the blunt and much game approach of measure how many child get over the five plus plus at gcse hurdle it be also materially well than the old contextual value add measure which effectively lower expectation for entire group of child we also need threshold to trigger intervention so that underperform school can be move into strong trust that can well support they that be stand up for parent and child who will get only one shot at schooling there be challenge to address and as say to the hon member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams high on that list post covid be attendance it be much well than it be but there be furth to go hope the government will keep and build on the measure that we put in place together with school and the wide education family we always need to strive to do more to support child with special educational need and disability and enable they to maximise opportunity be encourage by what the secretary of state say call on she and the government to keep and grow our capital programme for more special school place as well as as she rightly say to strive to support inclusion in mainstream education where that be possible and beneficial today there be great prevalence of mental ill health in young people crucially this issue be not specific to this country we see it in most comparable country or at least those where there be datum we can look at we see similar trend there the labour manifesto speak about have mental health professional in school when we be in government with the department of health and social care and the nhs we be already roll out mental health support team to cluster of school and urge the government to look at that of course we and other country must also ask why there be this increase prevalence of mental ill health in young people because it be international in nature some of the ready answer that might otherwise be throw about can not be correct we will work constructively with the government as they work to build on the landmark online safety act for example and ensure its most effective implementation school be all about teacher and we welcome the government plan to recruit more of course be large number but it be not quite so large in the context of the total number of teacher which be and it should be note that the increase in the number of teacher over the last parliament be considerably more than in fact it be more like however it be true that it have be tough to recruit for some subject such as computer science physics and modern foreign language and welcome the secretary of state focus on that area will the right hon gentleman give way if the hon member will forgive have well press on as might be stretch madam deputy speaker patience early in my time face she in the chair do not want to get off to bad start we will be look to see exactly what the target cover by when and crucially how it will be achieve the one subject in education that get lot of coverage in the medium and elsewhere during the election campaign be the taxation of independent school we recognise that that be in the labour manifesto but it be still wrong headed it will not hit the famous big name school but it will hit small town school family of child with special educational need and certain religious faith most of all in the big way it will hit state school we do not know how big the displacement effect will be of family who can no long afford to send their child to their independent school and we can not know because there be no precedent but we know that it will be material number will my right hon friend give way will with apology one thing that have not be discuss in this debate about extra taxation on private school be that they generate billion year in export win this could have an effect on the country current account deficit we must not get into long debate on this but my hon friend be absolutely right that export earning be part it as be multinational choice of this country to site their headquarters all these thing be consideration include the ministry of defence inadvertently skip over the hon member so give way to he now thank the right hon member for take my question his figure on teacher number be very interesting do he not recognise that over the last parliament the teacher retention rate be at an all time low with third of teacher leave within five year of go into the profession again must not get into too lengthy debate on but can in the last couple of year we actually find that retention be well than have be anticipate we want teacher to stay long in the profession which be one of the reason why during my first spell in the department for education we bring in the early career framework specifically to address that issue the secretary of state have say that the government will continue to evolve that which welcome too but the fact of the matter be that we have teacher in the profession part of that be to do with retention and part of it be to do with people return to the profession which at time have be well than anticipate it be also to do with the significant programme to get people into teaching in the first place through bursary and scholarship return to taxation and independent education ask the minister of state department for education the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell at the very least today when she sum up to confirm that the government will not bring the measure far forward so that we end up with in year disruption for family and for state school try to cope with potential influx of large number of child can she also guarantee that the large number of spending programme that have be link to this taxation income stream include the teacher be protect regardless of what happen on that vat income be close to the end we set about major upgrade in technical and vocational education the secretary of state say something important and think new about what be go to happen hope the government will see through level and the reform of technical and vocational education on the blueprint we always do this in government we take cross party approach of lord sainsbury the secretary of state mention that she will update the house tomorrow will the minister of state confirm in sum up that that will be an oral statement give hon and right hon member chance to question the minister on exactly what be propose we will also scrutinise the government propose change to apprenticeship and the levy understand that business want more flexibility on what they can do with levy money but the two crucial thing about the apprenticeship levy be that first it deal with what economist call the free rider problem under which some business historically invest strongly in train their staff while other do not but benefit when staff leave those business to join they after two or three year secondly the levy ensure that human capital investment go into incremental training it do not just rebadge training that would have happen anyway in whatever reform the government undertake those two thing will have to be deliver on skills england we just need to know what it be we understand the desire of labour government to say in an emergency break glass reach for quango but what will it do that be different from what be do today by the institute for apprenticeships and technical education by local skill improvement plan and by the unit for future skills be proud that disadvantaged youngster be now much more likely to go on to high education than they be despite of course prediction of the opposite at the time the student financing system be bring in remember very well that when in opposition labour members of parliament say repeatedly that fee should never go as high as or and we will be watch for consistency in their approach in the month and year ahead we need to ensure high quality provision for student it do no favour to young person to go to university if it be for course where we know high proportion of student do not even complete the course we speak during the election campaign of our plan to build on our foundation of the office for student to ensure that in whatever subject it might be student could be confident that their course be of high quality the new government need to set out how they in their way will ensure that that quality be guarantee to member hooray come on it be often say it be say early this afternoon that the first duty of government be to defend our country and our national security and to keep people safe it be the most fundamental function of government to have sound management of the economy and the finance the noble drive in government be to strive to spread opportunity as far and as equitably as possible ultimately education be the key to almost everything we wish the new government and this team of ministers well we will work positively and constructively with they we will scrutinise what they say monitor what they do and hold they to account for what they deliver may start by congratulate you madam deputy speaker on your election and say what great pleasure it be to see you in your place also congratulate the secretary of state on her appointment know how deep her commitment be to increase opportunity and adjust disadvantage for child across our country education from the early year through school and on to further and high education be arguably the most important tool in the government box for address disadvantage be therefore delighted to see that break down the barrier to opportunity at every stage be one of the core mission of this labour government labour have always recognise the importance of education as route to address poverty disadvantage and inequality as well as to drive economic growth it be at the heart of what we believe in and at the heart of what we have always deliver in government from comprehensive school to the open university from sure start to the london challenge for school improvement this new labour government will continue in that proud tradition of deliver for our child and young people with free breakfast club in every primary school new nursery place across the country open access mental health support in school and community more teacher in our school new fit for purpose curriculum further education sector to deliver the skill that young people need to thrive and our economy need to grow and new support to protect young people from serious violence wish to highlight today as we discuss the commitment of this new government and also the mess that they have inherit after year of conservative cut to child service some of the issue that be most press in my constituency service be now really stretch to the limit as they seek to support child young people and their family the first issue be the funding crisis face maintain nursery school which often provide gold standard of early year education some of they be locate in area with the great deprivation have two in my constituency effra nursery school and child centre and dulwich wood nursery school they be constitute as school and therefore have the additional expertise and also the additional cost of fully qualified headteacher and teach staff the number of maintain nursery have already drop dramatically and only now remain many of which face severe financial difficulty therefore urge the government to bring forward measure in the budget to ensure that the depth of knowledge expertise and quality in our maintained nursery school be not lose and that they be put on sustainable financial footing the second issue be special educational need and disability support be grateful to the secretary of state for mention the work that do in this regard when we be in opposition in the context of the decimation of local authority funding since and with increase presentation of additional need across the country local council and school be simply buckling under the pressure of resource that they do not have and need that they can not meet while family be suffer the consequence at recent visit to an outstanding school in my constituency the headteacher break down as she describe the conflict of seek to be an inclusive school with the reality of simply not have the funding that she need to deliver for child with additional need increasingly local authority be be drive to the edge of financial viability by the cost of send support and send transport really welcome this government focus on the inclusivity of mainstream school but they will need to work very closely with the ministry of housing communities and local government and the department of health and social care to ensure that there be sustainable approach to fund send support which school can not deliver in isolation thirdly the outcome for care experienced people after year of conservative government be utterly disgraceful the system be so broken that frequently the state take the decision to remove child from their family because they be not consider to be safe and place they in an environment in which they be even less safe and secure care experienced people be so over represent in both the criminal justice system and the homeless population because they be be so badly fail if the government be serious about tackle these challenge they must turn their attention to deliver well support and well outcome for care experienced people one way that this situation could be turn around be through the development of new care experience covenant place on statutory footing require every part of the public sector to take the responsibility of corporate parenting seriously support by national care leaver offer wonder whether the minister be able to make any commitment in that regard today finally the conservative government change the school funding formula to remove the disadvantage weighting that have the effect of proactively funnel funding away from school in constituency such as mine with high level of deprivation to more affluent area of the country and my local school be really feel the impact as they seek to provide an excellent education for every child will the minister give an undertaking to look at the school funding formula to ensure both that school in the most disadvantaged area of the country have the resource they need to deliver for every child and that the formula itself be no long pit different area of the country against each other but represent genuine levelling up of the resource for our school know that this government will transform the life chance of child and young people across our country and make sure that no child be leave behind look forward to see further plan come to fruition as child young people and their life chance be once again place where they should be at the centre of our national life as we have many maiden speech to enjoy and back bench contribution may ask those on the front bench to keep their speech short call the liberal democrat spokesperson may warmly welcome you to the chair madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to see you also warmly welcome the education secretary and all her ministers to their post as the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds say they absolutely have the good job in government be very jealous indeed but be look forward to work with they constructively over the course of this parliament to deliver the good possible start for child and young people be delighted to be speak today on behalf of the third party in the house from the vastly expand liberal democrat benches be grateful for the government make time today for dedicated debate on education and opportunity over the past few year child and young people education have frankly be sideline in the political agenda it be no surprise to that his majesty loyal opposition do not seek to allocate specific time for this area during the king speech debate instead bundle all public service welfare and the economy into single evening debate today debate be therefore very welcome indeed education be the great investment that we can make to ensure that every child no matter their background have the opportunity to flourish to their full potential as result it be also the great investment that we can make for our economy and our society the king speech and government announcement in the past three week have include some encouraging measure that the liberal democrats welcome on that note very much welcome the education secretary announcement on the level qualification review the liberal democrats have long be say that btecs should not be fund until level have properly bed in actually level be squeeze so many young people out of the system and leave they without option that we need good range of option so the review be very welcome also welcome the curriculum review that she announce the devil of course in all the announcement so far will be in the detail hope that ministers will work collaboratively cross party on the area where we be in agreement though there be area where we be not in agreement one area where we be in violent agreement be the state in which the conservative government leave our school and college shortly before the election speak to school governor in my constituency who tell that their school be at rock bottom their school budget have be so squeeze that they be reliant on amazon wish list from which parent be ask to provide basic essential such as whiteboard pen and glue stick that have become the reality for so many school up and down the country not only be school struggle to afford basic supply but they lack the resource to maintain their building it be now well document that the leader of the opposition when he be chancellor repeatedly refuse to fund the investment in school building that the department for education make clear be need the result child be be teach in classroom with leaky window broken heating and crumble concrete where even to start with special educational need we hear about this issue from the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes suspect that every member across this house new and return have bulging inbox of send casework the system be in crisis local authority be stretch to the limit and our most vulnerable child be struggle with their parent stick in an adversarial system fight day in and day out to ensure that their child can get an education and the support that they deserve to thrive inadequate support for send child in mainstream school couple with lack of specialist provision mean that too many child be languish at home without proper access to education or travel huge distance at great cost to overstretch local authority because there just be not enough local provision the lack of provision be have an impact on not only our pupil but our teacher many be be drive out of the profession because of the pressure that they face they often tell that they be act as the fourth emergency service because all the support service outside our school be crumble not enough new teacher be enter our classroom despite the figure that the shadow secretary of state give the previous conservative government miss their own secondary schoolteacher training target for out of year that mean not only that many child be not be teach by specialist in their subject but that exist teacher be have to take on inordinate workload due to the lack of staff study conduct this year find that of teacher believe that their job have negatively impact their mental health with an increase workload be the main cause of stress over the past nine year the conservatives neglect our education system and our child and young people be now pay the price for the sake of our future generation we must prioritise fix it interruption will mention the coalition shortly just to cheer up the hon member for south west hertfordshire mr mohindra the liberal democrats welcome the announcement in the king speech of child wellbee bill we have long argue that wellbee should be at the heart of our policymaking for child and young people hungry child struggle with their mental health will not be able to achieve their potential either academically or socially we know that poverty and mental ill health be significant contributor to the staggering number of child miss from school we welcome the long await introduction of the child not in school register measure that have have cross party support for several year and feature in the liberal democrat manifesto this be particularly important give that last autumn term there be child miss from education with vulnerable child slip under the radar the change be long overdue and hope that the government implement it without delay that register be very important for safeguard but we must address the underlie cause of school absence we have see an explosion of mental ill health among child and young people in recent year it be estimate that one in five child have probable mental health disorder that is six in every classroom lack of available mental health support mean that many child be leave languish at home miss out on key learning time it also have much more serious consequence the day after the election be call speak to local secondary headteacher in my constituency several child in recent month have end up in after attempt suicide broken mother whose teenage daughter have tragically be successful in take her own life early this year approach in local park and speak to about how local service have let her daughter down prevention be well than cure the liberal democrats welcome the government commitment to introduce mental health practitioner in every secondary school but we must start at young age that be why the liberal democrats have long call for the introduction of mental health practitioner in every primary and secondary school recognise the mental health support team introduce by the previous government but they be share across far too many school the average primary school get half day week and the average secondary school get maybe one or two day week those school need full time dedicated support give the level of need in school we know that of all lifetime mental health disorder develop by the age of put mental health practitioner in every primary school would allow we to address those issue before they become permanent ultimately save our health service money in the long term another underlying cause of absence from school and pressure on school staff be the grow number of child live in poverty it be disappointing that the government continue to refuse to lift the two child cap on benefit the liberal democrats will continue to campaign for that cruel policy to be remove which would immediately lift child out of poverty child up and down the country can not afford to eat with some child be force to pretend to eat out of empty lunchboxe or reportedly even eat rubber out of desperation in country as wealthy as ours no child should be go hungry at school that be why be immensely proud that it be the liberal democrats in government who introduce free school meal for every infant schoolchild interruption it be liberal democrat policy that we have to fight for in government the benefit of free school meal be immense they save parent time and money help child to eat more healthily and have even be prove to boost educational outcome although labour have propose free breakfast club for child in primary school which will be beneficial often the child most in need be those live very far from school in temporary accommodation who have extremely long journey and simply can not get to school in time for breakfast free school meal guarantee that those child have access to hot healthy meal in the middle of each school day to give they the energy that they need to learn most importantly hunger do not stop at the age of accord to the child poverty action group an estimate child in poverty miss out on free school meal and many of they be in secondary school that be why the liberal democrats be commit to roll out free school meal to every child in poverty whether they be primary or secondary school age in line with henry dimbleby recommendation to the previous conservative government which they completely ignore sadly research show that the inequality within our education system be deepen as we have hear accord to datum publish by the education policy institute just last week by the time student from disadvantaged background leave secondary school they be month behind their peer that be the high attainment gap in over year establish by the liberal democrats in government the pupil premium be once vital fund to support disadvantaged child unfortunately we have see that value erode by some in real term since the tories be leave to their own device in one prove method to tackle the attainment gap be tutor in small group and one to one in fact research conduct by the education endowment foundation show that over the course of year an average four month of additional progress be make because of tutoring although flaw in its delivery the national tutoring programme which be introduce during covid and the to tuition fund have transformational impact for many pupil talk about his experience of tutoring aiden from london south east colleges say that he be aim only for the third time he retook his english gcse he just want to get it over and do with but he now have and it be all thank to his tutor he be go on to do high level qualification and he hop to go to university and become paramedic it be not just aiden whose grade improve there be additional pass in gcse english and math over the two year that government fund tutoring be in existence sadly at the last budget the conservative government refuse to continue fund for the national tutoring programme or the to tuition fund the funding run out today pretty much because it be the end of the academic year give the new secretary of state state commitment to extend opportunity to all and narrow the attainment gap will she look at the programme urgently and ensure that tutoring funding continue will my right hon friend allow an intervention be not right honourable just yet but give way to my hon friend apology give what my hon friend be talk about it be important to note that apply vat to independent school will have significant effect on their affordability for parent who make that choice in my mid dunbartonshire constituency not all parent will be able to afford the extra per child we hear about the pressure that the state be already under do she agree that there will be significant additional cost to the state in scotland as well as in england and wales order thank my hon friend for her important intervention she pre empt what be about to say about the issue of vat on private school fee and the pressure that it will create for some family and school have set out range of target measure that think would help tackle the disadvantage gap they be part of an ambitious package that the liberal democrats put forward at the election to ensure that our education system enable every child to thrive and that the local state school be the school of choice for every family in this country but as liberal we champion choice and it be important that parent can choose the good and most appropriate option for their child importantly and fundamentally we believe in the principle that education whether we be talk about private school music tuition private tutoring or childcare should not be tax so we oppose the labour government policy to introduce vat on independent school fee do not think the policy will do much at all to boost our state school in fact it risk reduce the brilliant partnership work the sharing of staff time and facility for example that we see between so many private school and their local state school have see that vividly with hampton school and lady eleanor holles school in my constituency work with the reach academy in feltham in very deprived area they have really help to boost the life chance of many of those child in feltham include by help with coach for university and medical school interview my hon friend be make an excellent speech do she agree that in many local authority area such as mine in buckinghamshire school be already oversubscribed so the place in the state sector simply do not exist for independent school parent who find they can no long afford the fee thank my hon friend for her intervention hear repeatedly that there be area across the country where school be full and parent be wonder where on earth they will be able to send their child to school it be simply not true that it be just the ultra wealthy who send their kid to private school be particularly concerned about those parent who for whatever reason feel that the local state school be not well suited to their child need that particularly apply to the child in the independent sector with special educational need who do not qualify for an education health and care plan and will not be exempt under the government propose policy have hear too often from parent on the doorstep and in my inbox really want to send my child to the local state school and we try it but it just could meet my child need so we be now make all sort of sacrifice to send they to much small more pastoral independent school where they have be transform it be those family who will be penalise under this policy that be particularly worried about the vast majority of independent school be small with few than pupil and number will struggle to survive as parent be price out put pressure on state school as we have hear today debate be focus on education and opportunity as liberal democrats we recognise that education be the ultimate creator of opportunity and empower every person to build well future for themselves and contribute to our economy and society yet our young people have be let down for far too long desperately hope that with new government that will change and look forward to work constructively with they wherever possible on meaningful action to ensure that it do we come to our first maiden speech this afternoon call darren paffey thank you madam deputy speaker may begin by congratulate you and wish you well as you take

you to the chamber as do the secretary of state and her team congratulate the hon member for southampton itchen darren paffey on his maiden speech he join two other darren be one of many sarahs in the house until recently we form nearly of the liberal democrats be happy to say that we be now more diverse in our name welcome the opportunity to speak about education and opportunity but the sad reality be that many child across glastonbury and somerton be miss out on the opportunity to have an education as they have additional requirement that their school be simply unable to accommodate after the conservative government cut to school and council budget education health and care plan have become the only avenue for family seek to access support they face postcode lottery and be force to wait month to get the support that they need demand for ehcp have triple since covid and local authority be struggle to meet demand only half of ehcp be issue within the statutory week timeframe at this point must declare an interest as serve somerset councillor today north yorkshire council have move to restrict the service that it offer for home to school transport which will have disproportionate impact on rural school and family the conservatives have be sweep from power in parliament but they be still have damaging impact on local government in area such as mine in north yorkshire do my hon friend agree that we should provide rural family and school with more support not less to tackle the challenge that they face my hon friend make really powerful point likewise somerset council be forecast to spend million this year on child and family service include on special educational need and disability provision increase on last year the increase in ehcp have also increase the cost of home to school transport the high cost be far exacerbate in somerset because it be such large rural county like yorkshire the average cost to somerset council of travel for one passenger with send be over year cumulatively the local authority high need budget deficit be estimate to be billion and the figure be ever increase the late estimate be that the deficit will increase to billion by there be many local authority work with the department for education through intervention such as the safety valve programme those programme demonstrate that local authority despite employ good practice be still struggle to cover the deficit and any saving make be likely to be lose through inflation the liberal democrats want to end the send postcode lottery that family face by give local authority extra funding to reduce the amount that school pay towards child ehcp this be urgent because child be suffer they be unhappy they be miss their friend and they be miss their education and as result their family be suffer too speak recently to the parent of child in wincanton who have an ehcp that need an urgent review it do not happen and the child school could not meet their need that result in they be absent from school and missing month of crucial education have also be work with group of parent of child with send and one mother from curry mallet tell that she believe our education system will see rise in attendance problem and adverse mental health and an increase need for send support due to the inflexibility of the system and its inadequacy for meet the need of young people in modern time it be total disgrace for any child to be leave without an education because if may return to the title of this debate it strip they of opportunity child with send will continue to suffer as result of the lack of place at special school government statistic from early this year reveal that around two third of special school be full or over capacity with department for education datum show that there be around more pupil on roll in special school than there be report capacity in glastonbury and somerton there be two special school and hope that third will be ready to open near ash for the start of the new school year provide much need extra provision child and their family across the country face crisis cause by the lack of specialist provision and it will not go away cut to council budget under the conservatives have make the situation intolerable and we must act urgently to reverse they liberal democrats will work with the government to ensure that all child can access the tailor learning and support that they need believe that we must set up dedicated national body for send to act as champion for child with complex need and ensure that they receive tailor support commend the hon lady for what she have say she be right to focus on send in the press last week it be indicate that if child who have autism have early diagnosis and treatment and an education system put in place the autism no matter how severe can be reduce to level that mean that the child can have an education and job if we get it right early we prepare that child for the future thank the hon gentleman for that important and valid point briefly shift my focus towards the forthcoming curriculum and assessment review have be speak to the principle of strode college in street which have around student on btec course that will be de fund follow that review know that the government policy be to pause and delay the defunding of applied general qualification encourage the secretary of state who be no long in her place to ensure that that remain the case to prevent any unnecessary interruption to student education believe that every child no matter their background can achieve great thing and we must give they the opportunity to do so congratulation on your election madam deputy speaker and on take your place it be wonderful to see you here also congratulate my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey on his maiden speech it be very moving informative and funny exactly as maiden speech as ought to be and hope that he have successful time in this place welcome the secretary of state comment on child with special educational need but want to raise an issue that have already be mention number of time the lack of available school space for child with special educational need want to talk about two school in my great grimsby and cleethorpes constituency cambridge park academy and humberston park school the parent of child there with special educational need be very concerned about their education because the school lack capacity and the place to meet the need of the area the parent also have concern that if their child can not go to local school they will have to go out of area that add pressure to child who will perhaps have to move away from friendship group and to family because there would be additional travel time and they would be far away if issue arise with the child in that out of area placement that be incredibly difficult for family we should also mention the problem when child with special educational need or disability reach the plus point in education they can become trap in never end cycle of try to achieve level or level qualification in math and english qualification that sometimes they be just not go to achieve that just set they up repeatedly for failure urge the new secretary of state and her team to take look at that and perhaps consider be more flexible we should view education in the light of support young people to achieve their maximum potential and not focus on that very narrow academic path associate myself with the comment of my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes on state maintain nursery we have the state maintain great coates village nursery in my constituency and scartho nursery school sit just outside my constituency but service child within it both face an increasingly challenging environment during my previous time in parliament champion those nursery school and secure additional funding for they but that be only temporary again our local conservative council be seek to reduce the number of state maintain nursery due to funding shortage ask that that be look at as matter of urgency as have just be mention the conservative government have start the process of scrap btecs decision that the protect student choice campaign have describe as reckless it will be welcome across the sector that this new labour government have decide to pause and review that decision btec qualification be well understand by employer applied general qualification lend themselves well to young people who be not sure about their career path but have an interest in particular sector or industry talk about young people with send whom the cycle of repeat math and english do not suit btecs may be the right route for they they be flexible they sit well alongside other academic qualification such as level and apprenticeship and they can be study as stand alone course when we in labour talk about opportunity surely flexibility and range of option to support young people through their learning and education must feature the secretary of state speak of break the class ceiling and btecs enable that very thing for those for whom the stricture of the current school system have not capture their skill or energy btecs allow for broad exploration of work area and provide another route into university or employment franklin sixth form college in my constituency which be my college have have great success its btec student have go on to work as paramedic in nursing and in engineering take this opportunity to commend the outgoing principal peter kennedy on his excellent work during his time at the college when it have go from require improvement to outstanding in its ofsted inspection know that he would want to recognise the excellent support that he have have from his governor and staff who have support his vision for the growth and improvement of the college they have do amazing work and provide an outstanding education establishment for grow number of young people wish he well in his retirement welcome the incoming principal wendy ellis who be confident will continue that excellent work and like peter will never lose her enthusiasm for young people it be imperative for the young people of great grimsby and cleethorpes that plan for btecs be put in place swiftly to ensure that there be sufficient time for college to advertise course and for student to know what be available in time for the term be go to ask how long the review process would take but the secretary of state take the wind right out of my sail by say that it will be complete by the end of the year that be excellent and welcome news and congratulate the team on take that process seriously and put set of measure in place swiftly as part of that review the government could consider allow student to enrol on all exist apply general qualification the agq that have be mention up to and include the academic year if it help the government make decision that would cost nothing because funding be not due to be withdraw until august and it would avoid the concern about young people disengage entirely from education without option such as btecs be available ask the house to give little leeway to talk specifically about academisation would not ordinarily rise to speak in favour of academy as broad brush educational principle but that be the landscape that we currently find ourselves in one that franklin college would like to explore as an empty multi academy trust it would be local substantial system lead mat for northern and coastal lincolnshire that status have be apply for via very exceptional route as understand it but the application be currently sit with regional director of the dfe despite the proposal be widely support by local stakeholder the principle behind the move towards academisation be to build on the college strong track record of support for local school and academy and engagement with employer and other organisation on initiative to materially change young people life the change in status would allow the college to support the area school and employer to meet future need for highly educate highly skilled young people for grow local industry such as clean energy that be absolutely necessary perhaps the secretary of state or her team could write to advise on how that process can be move along to the next stage that would give confidence and clarity to the college and potential future partner and would be of benefit to the whole of northern lincolnshire and beyond the future of young people in great grimsby and cleethorpes be concern not just for but for the local authority and the wide community there be strong desire across the constituency not just for available and plentiful opportunity for child and student but for the provision to get they into those opportunity easily the young people of great grimsby and cleethorpes have all the same ambition and talent as young people anywhere else in the country and want that ambition and talent to be nurture with the right structure in place to enable and lift every single one of they call aphra brandreth to make her maiden speech congratulate the hon member for southampton itchen darren paffey on his maiden speech this be my maiden speech madam deputy speaker and must tell you that arrive in this place fire with enthusiasm so much so that my whip have warn that need to be careful that that be not how end up leave this place fire with enthusiasm be new woman represent new

those below the river dee and many and varied village in the heart of cheshire audlem bunbury wybunbury wrenbury weaverham lache handbridge christleton and huntington tarporley tattenhall tarvin kelsall cuddington farndon malpas those be just some of the very special place with which you madam deputy speaker and this house be go to become quite familiar in the come year hope much of my constituency be rural which be one reason why find the king speech so disappointing this government profess an ambition for growth if so it be simply extraordinary that there be no mention of the contribution of farming to our national economy food be fundamental the contribution of the countryside to our country be incalculable and government who be so metropolitan in their outlook that they fail to understand that and reflect it in their agenda be to use the context of today debate both miss an opportunity and in need of an education my constituency be both urban and rural as be our country understand the importance of both and the necessary balance between the two be key to our country future economic and societal success the joy of my constituency be that it include rich range of dynamic village community and swathe of one of the great historic city in europe the matchless city of chester it be business and tourism hub that face challenge of course from basic connectivity

than visitor each year to the excitement of oulton park racetrack and peckforton castle the home of civil wedding in england say that advisedly because it be the then owner of peckforton castle who inspire former member of parliament for the city of chester to introduce private member bill that become the marriage act for the first time that act allow civil wedding in this country to take place in venue other than registry office include castle historic house hotel and chester zoo some might argue that that single piece of legislation have contribute more to happiness in england than any other legislation of its type the former member who introduce that legislation who know quite well in fact have know he since be bear remind regularly that his act illustrate how in this place an ordinary back bencher can make difference hope to make difference in the year to come not only by badger the government about deliver local bus service and improve mobile phone and broadband connectivity and demand that they back our farmer and ensure the investment and infrastructure our village and city need to thrive but perhaps by introduce legislation of my own in the fullness of time draw inspiration from my constituency and from my predecessor not only my father who be the member for city of chester in the mr speaker will know both how marvellous and sometimes how irritate

crisis indeed catastrophe as see in the newspaper this week and to recognise again the intrinsic value of high education and the role of our university as powerful instrument of local economic growth and the foundation of our national success in research innovation and skill surrey heath be wonderful place to live we be bless with strike and historic landscape as the name of the constituency suggest we be define by ancient lowland heath last remnant of prehistoric woodland clear over the century and keep clear by graze burn and cut although not strictly natural these heath be the preserve

win state boarding school and national monument to general gordon of khartoum the royal military academy sandhurst where british army officer be train straddle the boundary of surrey heath and nearby bracknell forest although most of the rma building be technically in berkshire will claim they little for surrey heath today there can be no doubt of the connection between sandhurst and surrey heath main market town of camberley camberley be product of the royal military college which be form in sandhurst in in the year that follow settlement form at the margin of the college include the plan community of cambridge town name after the duke of cambridge the head of the british army at the time as the town grow so do confusion between cambridge town and cambridge its much less well known and less distinguished namesake somewhere in the midland apology to hon member represent cambridge this problem be especially feel by user of the postal service whose letter would frequently find themselves long delay and hundred of mile from their intended year have go by and little have change royal mail request name change and it be the new upstart cambridge town that relent change its

when it be not clog up through surrey heath as they travel between london and the south west often without even realise that they be pass through this fine constituency on the other hand surrey heath road user may be more aware of the less smooth and much less efficient point of entry on to the at the junction with the my predecessor michael gove more on he in moment spend many an hour at that particular road junction over the past few year but even his formidable talent could not resolve this serious shared local frustration hope can make some headway on that issue in the month and year to come in restoration england of the hold up on the highway of what be now surrey heath be of rather different kind the great west road know less prosaically today as the be the main connect route between london and the great port city of the south coast it be lucrative prospect for highwayman and opportunistic cutpurse especially on the long isolate stretch around bagshot heath william davis the so call golden farmer and claude duval be two of the most notorious and noteworthy of the century land pirate duval be recall as gentleman of the road gracious to the point of obsequiousness he would relieve you of your jewel while dance with your wife and compliment you on the finery of your apparel an abhorrer of physical violence the history book recall he as master of politeness smile pleasantly to your face while metaphorically stick the knife in now the sharp eared among you may recognise pass one might even say limited and specific similarity between duval and another more recent gentleman of surrey heath road refer of course to the former member for surrey heath my predecessor michael gove who serve the constituency and this house with considerable distinction and flair for just shy of year both be man possess of singular vision note for their grace and observance of the high courtesy and manner unlike duval there be no evidence to suggest that michael outing to the involve any public display of dancing those as far as we can tell he save for the nightclub of old aberdeen conservative members to my right may go far but for my part be certain that that be where any similarity end michael gove will rightly be remember as transformative minister even by teacher this be debate on education who will consider he transformative but not necessarily beneficially so he be talented parliamentarian his oratorical skill mark he out as once in generation performer at the dispatch box he will be greatly miss in this house by both his friend and his opponent and be sure they will want to join in wish he well in whatever his future have in store personally be hugely indebted to the people of surrey heath for elect to be the first non conservative mp for our constituency in year this be vote to be take seriously again one for local mp who will work in this place to further the cause of great community and we need that now more than ever surrey heath road and rail infrastructure require significant investment it can not be right that it take long to travel between camberley and london in than it do century ago we need to end the postcode lottery of health and to address the deep inequality in life expectancy and life opportunity that scar and divide our community welcome the commitment of the secretary of state for health to prioritise the rebuilding of raac affect hospital such as frimley park hospital in my constituency but we need reassurance that the new frimley park will be the right hospital provide the right service and sit in the most appropriate location accessible by road rail and bus and that it do not come at the expense of lose vital green or amenity space we also need fair deal for our young people with genuinely affordable home and new educational and training opportunity we urgently need to fix surrey break special educational need provision in the spirit that there be always more that unite we than divide we look forward to work with member across the house to achieve those thing for surrey heath and in support of community across the uk finally our family all too often pay high price indeed the high price to enable we to do what we do in this house and to participate in the long and stressful campaign that go before and which soon enough will come again in closing express my love and thank to my wife philippa and to my child jamie and will for put up with for their limitless support and for be the good team anyone could ever hope to be part of rise order before call the next speaker members may have notice that this debate be very oversubscribed due to time constraint and to get as many people in as possible be now impose six minute time limit on all back benchers who be not make their maiden speech it be great to see you in your place madam deputy speaker strong yorkshirewoman no less which be exactly what we need in the chair thank the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton for his excellent maiden speech he have do his constituent proud and it be great to hear from he and indeed from all who have make maiden speech today the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds mention the literacy hour as child be lock out of education have dyslexia attention deficit hyperactivity disorder dyspraxia and host of different medical need that make it very difficult and challenging to lead normal life remember not be able to read or write legibly some may say that still do not write legibly and remember the great influence that the literacy hour have on when be seven and eight year old the change model of education involve minute of carry out different task suit to and give lifelong love of literature it mean that by the time take my gcse instead of fail and be lock out of education get an in english literature be still proud of that today because it happen against all the odd have be chair the all party parliamentary group for special educational need and disability because think it important for we to give young people that opportunity the narrowing of the curriculum that we have see over the last year horrify be scientist and love drama and art at school they unlock creativity which allow to go on to become the scientist who be creative think outside the box and do great thing want all child who be experience the struggle that have face to have the opportunity that have under labour government but be go on about myself too much because what we be here to talk about be the opportunity for our young people and our community it may sound like cliché but it be still true to say that education be one of the main way to create opportunity in our community so it be excellent that we be have this debate so early in the new parliament and it be good to hear from my colleague on the government front bench about the positive step that they be take to create an education system that be fit for all want to focus my comment on provision for special educational need and disability and on how we can create opportunity for everyone in the education system it be no secret that the new government have inherit send system in crisis underfunde under resource and understaffed estimate from suggest that the total level of underfunding in the last parliament be billion with the last government promise only fraction of the expenditure need to bridge the gap when that be combine with the chronic underfunding of local authority it be easy to see why there be so many story about authority that have be unable to meet their statutory obligation it be also no wonder that parent who rightly want to fight for what be good for their child have end up go to tribunal and more often than not they win in only of case have tribunal find in local authority favour that be damn statistic in two sens first it demonstrate the tenacity that parent need in order to secure the basic right to education for their child it be not but the former education secretary who be mention by the secretary of state early who say that the system be lose lose lose for family and she be right tribunal decision in your favour be bitter victory when all you ask be that your child have the same opportunity as everyone else secondly the extent of the skew in the tribunal figure show that the problem be endemic and need systemic response unfortunately that be not the approach take by the last government too often we see massaging of statistic rather than serious approach to tackle the underlie reality face too many young people we see the same with the target to cut the number of education health and care plan which be rather skirt around it be right that we aim to reduce the reliance on ehcp all child should have the opportunity that they need whether or not they have formal diagnosis and we also need action to ensure that people do receive the diagnosis that be so important especially for young girl and woman who often have to wait as do until their late or or in some case their or to receive diagnosis to explain why they have be struggle throughout their life key task for the new government will be to rebuild the infrastructure for early year intervention that we lose over the last year the cut to sure start have be dramatic but we also need more health visitor out in the community the institute of health visiting estimate that there be shortfall of in england with of health visitor say they will leave the profession in the next five year shockingly over quarter of those survey say that they be service the need of child three time the recommend ratio for health visitor it be simply not good enough early intervention be so important because they can change the life course of child they can open opportunity that can be cut off if the right support be not in place early year staff with the right training can be the passionate people who spot something in child that no other have notice really appreciate the hon member remark indeed be think about young child possibly with send diagnosis who struggle post one of the thing have learn from the northern ireland assembly where sit be that much more holistic model which combine health and education help young people post do the hon member agree that we need such model throughout the uk and that career advice should be do in holistic way completely agree that we need more holistic approach recently visit whirlow hall farm in my constituency which provide alternative provision but also far education in an agricultural setting it be great to see the opportunity for the young people who go there especially those with emotional distress and similar issue it be really important that we see all of this in the round and make sure that there be quality in all our service whether that be ap education in local mainstream school or get access to diagnosis which be so important for so many young people must not forget salt or speech and language therapist otherwise will get in trouble with they will draw my remark to close be pleased to see the good signal and direction that we have have so far the new approach will treat people as people and start from the premise that whatever their need or disability they be entitle to the same quality of education and opportunity as everyone else look forward to hear from the government what far plan they will be bring forward to make that reality call neil shastri hurst to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker may start by congratulate you on your election and on take up the chair

proud that several thousand hong kong british national overseas have choose to make the area their home the land now form solihull west and shirley be once cover by the ancient forest of arden on the bank of the river blythe the early settlement in the area can be date back to the iron age the density of the forest of arden be such that even the romans find it impenetrable for throughout the roman

during the course of my time in this house will seek to champion the early year agenda so that we give young people the good chance in life will also seek to work with member from across the house to improve send provision in this country so that we can move the conversation away from the level of disability and focus instead on the level of intervention and ensure that every child can access the

across our town and community perhaps that be no surprise give that our town invent the fibre optic cable and be the home of harlow college and the birthplace of rupert grint have no idea why put those thing in that order apparently harlow have the low density of pub per head of population that be okay though because there be one five minute staggering distance from my house it be the convention to talk about non controversial issue in one maiden speech that be tricky when you find yourself in room with people with oppose view think that might talk about football but be leeds supporter and my hon friend the members for southampton itchen darren paffey and for derby north catherine atkinson go before so think shall leave the subject alone but be sure this house will join in congratulate the mighty harlow town on their league cup victory last season let we not worry about what league it be instead decide to talk about young carer subject very close to my heart as have say

his way it be only at parent evening that find out that both george parent be severely physically disabled and that george and his sister be young carer feel terrible it be probably that experience that inspire to become more involved in support young carer the solution to george issue be really easy george like many young carer do not want to be treat differently what we do be say your sister can sign your planner for you as long as your sister get it sign there be no problem lo and behold he get it sign by his sister he get detention if he do not he be happy with that be pleased to say that that story be about year old think we have progress quite well in our recognition and understanding of young carer thank member from across the house the leader of the liberal democrats and my own prime minister for bring their experience to this house in recent school census of school say that they do not have any young carer can tell members that from my experience of support young carer that can not be correct it be predict that there be more than young carer in essex alone essex county council have identify roughly of they so there be huge number of young carer whom we have not identify let alone get the resource in place for would like to end my maiden speech on positive ask the house to join in thank all the young carer have work with and all young carer across great

ministers in their place the secretary of state be here early and the minister of state the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell be here now look forward to she sum up the contribution of the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds be also excellent we have have wonderful maiden speech today from conservative liberal democrat and labour members the house have be enrich by the combination of contribution include the intervention of the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood who will make her maiden speech at later stage as other member from northern ireland have especially thank the hon member for harlow chris vince whose story about young carer resonate with in particular as have have an interest in this area over the year think it resonate with everyone to be truthful but it resonate with because know young carer in my constituency perhaps they be not the good student but they have reason for it the story that he tell may be year old but it be still relevant today and thank he for it it be so important that we have debate on education have say in this place so many time that our young people truly be the future to ensure that they have the tool need to succeed we have to make difficult decision education be devolve in northern ireland so ministers here do not have respond on it they do not have to take any notice and they do not need to say to themselves must reply to the hon member they might wish to say something but they do not have any responsibility for our education however want to give northern ireland perspective as always do and make two point there be so many opportunity out there for young people some may know what route they want to take in life and for those who do not there be other option education may not be everybody option as the hon member for harlow say but there be other thing that we need to do through education as well minister will no doubt take that on board whether in employment further education or apprenticeship there be opportunity for people to avail themselves of furthermore be big supporter of work experience and the prospect that it can bring for young people especially in their education and future employment it can give young people taste for work and the possibility that it can lead they to try to offer it every year in my office as do when be member of the legislative assembly and when have my own business two of my young staff member one aged and one aged both do their work experience in my office one back in and the other in we never realise that they would one day end up work for they go and do another job in between but end up come back to whether they think be soft touch or what it be be not quite sure be sure that they do not think that the fact be that they love what we do in the office like other elect to this house my whole life have be about help people and make their life well that be our job it do not matter what political party we be in we have to try to do that in every part of life year later an opportunity come up for new staff and know the skillset that those two people be able to bring through their work experience they be able to come into the job like they have always be there that stick in my mind whether it be in aerospace healthcare science technology engineering and math government law medium trade such as mechanic or plumbing and so on the list be endless it be no secret that more need to be do on funding for the devolved nation it be reveal last year that northern ireland student number be reduce with funding cut indeed it have be indicate that the teaching grant for northern ireland university will be reduce by to save around million it be also plan that funding for further education college would be cut by to save an additional million in the limited time that have leave want briefly to discuss the opportunity that apprenticeship provide for young people mention early that not every person can have civil service job or be in university or another form of education but they can have opportunity out there in society our university be incredible but there be young people out there who do not see university as path for they to go down the number of people age to pursue an apprenticeship have be increase consistently since showcase how the world of work can provide opportunity for young people who perhaps do not want to go to university apprenticeship be provide in so many industry there be always something that can be find to give young people the good start on their employment path the issue always lie with funding and that be why it be so important that these issue be represent northern ireland have suffer for too long from ill thought out budget and lack of funding it be time for our word to be listen to and for budget to be reconsider for the betterment of young people and their future believe as everybody participate in this debate do that our young people be the future and want they to get many more opportunity than get we be responsible for ensure that education and employment opportunity be available to all young people across this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland because as you know madam deputy speaker we be always well together call catherine fookes to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker

as its mp my first priority will be to support the government drive for economic growth and keep household bill down so that we reduce that inequality talk of the drive for equality be only here because of the incredible woman who come before and because of the support have have from far too many individual woman to mention must shout out about the work of mentor programme such as the fabian women network mentor programme the labour women network and organisation such as elect her and parliament it be thank to they that we now have house in which of mp be woman we still have long way to get to and true equality so pledge as my second priority to continue my work to ensure that we do get an equal parliament will work with every single relevant secretary of state and every parliamentarian across the house to ensure that we reduce all the inequality that woman face from end the gender pay gap to halve violence against woman and push forward the menopause mandate campaign will of course do all that can to support monmouthshire fantastic charity and community group from cyfannol charity work to support those experience violence against woman to reach out group support those with addiction as keen environmentalist will do everything can to ensure we champion our environment and our river include the river wye and the river usk which flow through our beautiful county the people of monmouthshire have make it clear that they expect to work cross border and cross party with all the regulator campaigner and action group to bring our river back to full health monmouthshire be back on the westminster map for the first time in century and half my determination be to make sure that the legacy of this government for monmouthshire be more equal more prosperous and greener future it be great to see another former leeds city councillor in the chair madam deputy speaker the value that sport and art have in people life can not be overstate and in this speech want to talk about their importance in education the sad reality be there be significantly few access point for people from low socioeconomic background who have disability or who be black or from other minority group in to sport and the art my constituency be home to very special organisation call map which stand for music arts production it be an alternative provision offer access to creative subject for young people age to student gain qualification in art design and music as well as in functional skill and be welcome into creative community they can see that they could make career from pursue something creative and be introduce to range of role model relevant to their life who they would not have meet without attend map for young people who be struggle to fit in with our mainstream education system that can be life change and the effect on society overall be immense if we can reduce school exclusion rate by provide meaningful creative alternative we will be able to reduce youth violence young people will be less involve in crime and some of the strain on child and adolescent mental health service and other mental health service will be lessen when visit map staff tell of the confidence that attend provision such as map can instil in student have access to art subject allow people to develop strong sense of identity and transferable social skill and to build strong base of friendship and community child who have be push to the fringe be celebrate rather than punish be so pleased that labour plan to commission an urgent expert lead review into curriculum and assessment and hope that will mean broad more inclusive curriculum map be mainly fund by commercial activity which be not sustainable we must ensure that alternative provision that focus on creative education receive fund similar to mainstream provision invite the minister and the secretary of state to visit map with in leeds the issue around provision be not limit to to year old by september more to place will be need in leeds leed will have enough level place but there be huge shortage of place for alternative qualification that be cause number of problem for our young people who through no fault of their own be on waiting list for technical level and level course and be therefore officially not in education employment or training that be add to our skill gap and undermine the government growth target my view be that the great single challenge for our growth and energy mission be not investment or tax but skill look forward not only to the new growth and skill levy but to strategy for create the vocational place that we so desperately need sport be also crucial to the health of our nation and save the nhs billion year by prevent disease and improve wellbee through participation in community sport we be see crisis in the number of people who have active lifestyle and that start with school and education be hearten to know that the secretary of state understand that and be protect sport time hope that will mean that we can reach the target of minute of physical activity day for all young people welcome the approach my right hon friend be take we can not just tell young people about the benefit of sport and celebrate successful athlete although love the olympics and professional sport we also need to reimagine as labour be do the role that sport play in people life and have it at the heart of decision making hope we can see new funding for community coaching and equipment especially in sport that be widely play at grassroot but less so at elite level in the uk such as basketball music education be also vital area we know how much music enrich people life but if they do not have the mean to buy the equipment and to get music tuition it be impossible to access music to progress and to enjoy all that musical entertainment and education provide we need to offer that in our school and give that additional enrichment therefore hope to see an uplift in provision of music teaching improve access so that family can afford the high cost of many instrument science technology engineering and math subject be really important be former community scientist but we can not neglect the issue around creative education be pleased that we will carry on with the creative gcse and hope that we will see huge uplift in the uptake of art sport and creative subject in our school and around the education system that be my hope for enrich our country and our curriculum call baggy shanker to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker and congratulation

congratulate he on wonderful maiden speech and on speak with such passion about our child and the potential of the next generation want to pay tribute to my predecessor rob butler who know have great affection for aylesbury and who serve the constituency with great loyalty and good will it be true honour to be here as the new member of parliament for aylesbury give that my constituency house the county town of buckinghamshire and have return long line of conservative members to parliament as might be expect from that county be particularly proud to be here as aylesbury first ever labour mp and its first female mp my constituency be very diverse geographically it cover the rapidly grow town of aylesbury many lovely village such as whitchurch wing cheddington and edlesborough historic woodland and farmland and the chiltern hill it also have very diverse community with people of christian muslim hindu and other faith and people of asian african and eastern european heritage live alongside elderly resident and young people whose family have call my constituency home for many generation we be an historic constituency too britain old road the ridgeway cross through to ivinghoe beacon the remain of an iron age hill fort lie beneath aylesbury town and an aylesbury constituency have exist in some form since it be from aylesbury that john hampden defend parliament against charles in and his statue overlook market square in the town centre still celebrate the parliamentary freedom that he champion perhaps will not dwell for too long on our conservative lean political history from then onwards but want to highlight three other way in which history shape my brilliant constituency today first there be our vibrant culture roald dahl make buckinghamshire his home and today we host the roald dahl child gallery at discover bucks museum we be the birthplace of the paralympic movement and host the first competition for people with spinal injury in stoke mandeville back in for decade aylesbury be home to the iconic friars nightclub where act like queen and perform david bowie first performance of ziggy stardust there be now mark in the town by bronze sculpture which burst into song catch visitor by surprise secondly my constituency have history of offer friendly welcome include to many evacuee from london in world war two and the exile czech government who operate out of old manor house between wingrave and aston abbotts you can still see the bus shelter that the czech president instruct to be build on that road have take pity on the local schoolchildren wait in the rain we have see the same welcome to many people who have move into the constituency in recent decade and particularly into the many new housing development in the area thirdly want to highlight the inequality in income and wealth that exist in the constituency member of this house may be surprised to hear that aylesbury have high level of deprivation in fact one in eight child in the town live in poverty and we have always have history of people struggle to get by on low wage in the print and car factory or as agricultural labourer pay tribute to the local food bank and to fantastic charity such as youth concern and aylesbury homeless action group which make life more manageable for those who be struggle most today but they should not have to exist that take to the four point that will prioritise as the member for aylesbury and to the reason why want to speak in today debate on education and opportunity above all want my constituent to feel sense of opportunity and optimism again first will focus on the desperate need to improve healthcare we be home to stoke mandeville hospital where my son be bear and its internationally renowned spinal injury unit have the deep respect for everyone who work in the healthcare sector across the constituency but we have to make it possible for people to get basic healthcare and to see their gp again and we have to tackle the awful and pervasive mental health crisis in my constituency and across the country one of my most brilliant and good friend sophie middlemiss be not here to witness this moment of great change and opportunity for our country because she take her own life when her little girl be week old do not want anyone to suffer from post natal depression and anxiety in the way that she do and will fight to get well help for people in her situation secondly will focus on education for our child and will fight to ensure that all child whatever their background and circumstance get the opportunity that they deserve in life be particularly concerned about send child be pleased to have hear lot about that in the house today and their parent family carer and teacher who be not get anything like the support they deserve that have to change thirdly will help our business to thrive will support the small business that hope will be part of revival of aylesbury town centre we have to make it safe and attractive place to spend time again and we have to make it possible to get in across and out of town without spend hour in traffic will also support the farming business in the rural part of our constituency within wide careful approach to protect and manage our nature rich and agricultural land finally come to this job conscious not just of the challenge and the opportunity for my constituency and my country but of the very challenging moment that we be in globally before come to parliament be lead humanitarian aid agency and will continue to be voice for and do right by the most vulnerable people around the world there be record number of people catch up in conflict and crisis at time when geopolitical rivalry be on the rise and the global institution set up after

countless other place across the nation deserve our respect our support and our steady leadership in enact meaningful and lasting change this general election result see democracy in full swing which be deeply proud of but as many in the house will have witness there be rise in threaten malicious and intimidatory behaviour in our politic just as the constituent who put we here deserve respect commend those on all side of the house who have put themselves in this place in difficult circumstance ready to volunteer stand up and serve salute you all in that spirit of service it be an honour and great privilege to accept the prime minister offer of the role of minister for veterans and people and to take up the mantle of work not only for the people of selly oak as their mp but for veteran and family who have sacrifice so much for our nation and who have stand and fight often in the face of the unimaginable will stand with they as one of they to deliver the high duty of care commensurate with the risk and rigour that we expect from those who have defend and continue to defend the nation on the frontline achieve that will deepen the effectiveness of our service overall it be therefore huge thrill to announce yesterday in birmingham in my capacity as minister and to share here today that the invictus game which provide opportunity to those who have be wound in service in any way shape or form will be host in the great city of birmingham what well way to demonstrate the unconquerable soul and unity of our veteran their family and those serve and of birmingham and indeed great britain would like to step back and give the house reflection from my experience over the last year that may be relevant to the rest of the year after spend the past year in the far corner of this world fight to uphold and protect our democratic value member can not imagine genuinely mean this how humbling it be to participate in this democracy to go out on the campaign trail to knock on door to vote and to see the democratic process at work and now to stand here among this fantastic cohort see this election victory not only as moment for or from the perspective of selly oak or of all of we think it be moment for all democracy our deed must be as strong as our word the world have become tough and far more unstable with insecurity surround we as his majesty allude to in his speech last week we live in an increasingly fractious world one where autocratic regime seek to erode the universal freedom that our parent and grandparent fight to protect have be on some of those frontline and see that at first hand can tell the house that there be little doubt in my mind that the tapestry of the international order be fray and in some case now threadbare the rise of populism and extremism and the assault on value such as the rule of law self determination and democracy itself should be of the great concern to we all welcome and support the call for ceasefire in palestine and we watch with wary eye the development in the asia pacific most important though from my perspective be acknowledge and counter russia despicable and illegal invasion of ukraine russia have not only bring war to europe but even question whether ukraine have the right to exist and govern itself it be worth consider that if four year ago have stand here on either side of the house and explain that today in ukraine there would have be russian casualty by this time and that by the time hon member have have lunch there would have be and perhaps similar number of ukrainian casualty member would have probably tell that be scaremonger dramatist or at worst belligerent scot but here we be we have war on the edge of europe of scale and of such devastation that be inconceivable to we indeed it be take place at such pace that it be change the very character of warfare that be why welcome the defence review because the only thing consistent about change be that change be consistent we must adapt and keep pace with the shift character of conflict if not we risk fall short of our mission and indeed our duty and our responsibility to serve in my career have never stand idly by and do nothing in dangerous or uncertain time the united kingdom have not either we lead the way after fight for democracy all over the globe for so long it be great privilege to be stand here in this great chamber and carry that fight forward not only on behalf of selly oak defence and our veteran but on behalf of all the people in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland would

now as many state educate sacred heart girl in the house of commons as there be old etonian boy tangible demonstration of the radical redistribution of opportunity that this labour government represent my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter give an account of her school trip to parliament which remind of my own trip at the age of when get in trouble for sit down on these benches clearly such trip work to break down barrier to opportunity the journey start in child early year when their development and education begin under successive conservative government however the attainment gap have widen it be now some year since serve on the treasury committee but still recall our inquiry into childcare as part of national infrastructure it be ground breaking at the time and acknowledge that childcare be fundamental service to our economy it be not nice to have it be fundamental to allow parent to work long hour to provide for their family and it be fundamental to people life chance that be why this government will deliver more primary school base nursery make they widely accessible to parent and unlock opportunity for our young in answer to the shadow secretary of state question early that will be deliver in partnership with the sector to ensure that it meet the need of child and parent we know that childcare need do not end when school start when child move up to primary school in england they will benefit from the roll out of free breakfast club in every primary school in england this will drive up attainment improve behaviour and attendance and enable parent to start work on time and support their family it will set child up for the day and set they up to achieve because it be as much about the club as it be about the breakfast be in the classroom at the start of the day matter school have unique power to open up enormous opportunity for their pupil with teacher and support staff who make mark on every child life that include support child with special educational need and disability to flourish but across that system we have to acknowledge the many challenge that we face our building be substandard our child be too often unhappy in school and our support staff feel underappreciated we have to do well so many member today have touch on the crisis in support for those with special educational need and disability include my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes who know have work tirelessly on this issue for many year and my hon friend the member for dartford jim dickson who also speak passionately today this government will help school to take community wide approach to send improve their capability to accommodate pupil in mainstream setting and support they to flourish last week visit the brilliant croftway academy in northumberland it demonstrate how child of different ability and need can have the high standard of education in mainstream setting but we also need to ensure that special school can cater for those with the most complex need for those struggle with the pressure of school life this labour government will fund mental health support in every secondary school and in every community so that they can access support before problem escalate know that mental health be priority for many in this place as be powerfully describe by my hon friend the member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith in her speech as shadow schools minister hear many story of decision be take about our school that just do not factor in the need of community there be delay that turn to disappointment and frustration have see this in my own constituency with lack of proper planning cause chaos to school admission in gosforth this year and countless story of failure be replicate across the country so under labour school will need to co operate with their local authority on school admission on send inclusion and on place planning no more of the chaos that we have see over the last few year we want child to leave school with the skill and knowledge to set they up for life that mean broad and balanced curriculum that encourage they to try new thing ask question express themselves and be creative while also gain an excellent foundation in reading writing and math so we be establish an expert lead review on the curriculum and will collaborate with the sector to allow school teacher parent and student to contribute and to plan ahead on the question of remove exemption for private school which have be raise this change will enable vital investment in more teacher and improve nursery provision commend the contribution from my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince former math teacher while we be delighted that he be in his place we need to ensure that we have more math teacher in our state school my hon friend the member for monmouthshire catherine fookes speak about be school governor and we need more of those too my hon friend the member for montgomeryshire and glyndŵr steve witherden give powerful testimony to his dear late mother we share his grief and we share her pride ultimately education be about prepare child and young people for life and give they the skill they need to get on but these opportunity do not end at the school gate for too long education have be poorly match to the ambition of young people and the need of business and employer allow talent to go untapped and the economy to flag that be why early this week we announce skills england transformative new body to match education to the need of the economy by deploy skill investment strategically we will bring employment opportunity to the part of the country where young people need break and business need their skilled labour my hon friend the member for derby south baggy shanker speak powerfully about his apprenticeship and his passion for ensure those opportunity for other my hon friend the member for milton keynes central emily darlington speak about the need to not have to leave the place you love to get on in life my hon friend the member for gravesham dr sullivan want to see curriculum for life my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak have rightly be recognise as mention early all of this work will require partnership approach none of the challenge we face can be address by one person or one body alone that be why we be reset the relationship between government and the sector we be listen to professional we be learn from good practice we be work to improve standard across the board it be also why want to take this opportunity today to pay tribute to all those who work in our school to thank they and to wish they restful and restorative summer break under this labour government neither person place of birth nor the income of their parent will determine what they can achieve how they find fulfilment how they discover their skill and talent or how they grow in confidence because break down the barrier to opportunity be labour guide focus it be the job of this government and it be one that we be commit to deliver question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider education and opportunity

chair madam deputy speaker and what pleasure you have have in listen to such an excellent array of maiden speech this afternoon thank mr speaker for allocate one of the first adjournment debate in this new parliament my speech will be more of reiteration of certain point and less of novelty as be lucky enough to get an adjournment debate on the same flood defence at the beginning of the last parliament during that winter we suffer not only from coronavirus but from storms ciara and dennis congratulate the flood minister the hon member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy on her appointment she and be colleague on the treasury committee and know how passionately and genuinely she care about flooding issue so look forward to work with she my constituency be in part of the world that flood frequently and we realise that we will flood lot in west worcestershire we have the river severn run through the middle of the constituency and the rivers avon and teme flow into the severn just south of worcester so we accept that flooding be part of nature and part of what we have in west worcestershire in the year that have be fortunate enough to represent the area in parliament and before have try to mitigate some of the problem that arise from be in very flood prone part of the world last winter we again see how difficult it can be when there be very wet winter many local farmer resident and business be very grateful for funding from the flood recovery fund after storms babet and henk rural area be often the bad impact by flood damage yet they be often deem less of priority for flood defence than urban area do the hon lady agree that the flood defence grant in aid cost benefit analysis must be review to ensure it sufficiently value agricultural and rural community the hon lady highlight something that have grapple with throughout my time as member of parliament will now move on to the situation in tenbury wells in my constituency seventeen year ago this month in the middle of summer we have the most severe flooding for many many year it cause massive damage and misery across west worcestershire in fact it be the right hon member for leeds south hilary benn who be the environment minister at the time in he come to see the devastation in tenbury wells it be at that time that first start to look into these cost benefit analysis and the formula that the hon lady raise while accept that in west worcestershire we will flood regularly think that there be many thing we can do to mitigate the misery of be flood and of be flood regularly congratulate the right hon member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes on be elevate to deputy speaker she be well respect and her appointment be well deserved everyone in this house be very encouraged to see she in that position may also congratulate the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin on secure this debate be she aware that inadequate flood defence mean an increase in homeowner insurance premium that increase have be note in her constituency as it have be in mine of strangford do she agree that this house and government must work on uk wide approach to ensure that insurance premium be not hike because defence be inadequate the hon gentleman raise an important matter indeed it be after the flood that the idea of flood reinsurance scheme come about it be something that be establish when the last government come into power in it have now become somewhat easy to get insurance but it do continue to be challenge and shall highlight example of that in my speech it will be interesting to hear if the minister can confirm from the dispatch box whether flood re will continue to be priority for the new government have campaign successfully for many flood defence scheme in west worcestershire over the year we have make real progress in particular the two scheme that protect upton upon severn have be deploy year in year out in fact they have successfully protect upton upon severn from flood something like time since they be open in we have have bund build along the defford road in pershore flood defence gate instal in kempsey gate barrier instal at uckinghall bund build in powick and community scheme be now in place in callow end so there have be real progress we have see the cumulative impact of the many million that have be spend on flood defence across west worcestershire in the resilience that the community show last winter when it be so very wet would like to take this opportunity to put on record my thank to previous flood ministers to the team at the environment agency to worcestershire county council and to the regional flood defence committee which have help over time to get these flood defence scheme fund and build be very grateful to my hon friend for give way she describe the huge amount of investment that have be go into the river severn she have an awful lot of the river severn in her constituency she will be aware that in bewdley about million be be spend on flood defence she may remember that daniel kawczynski the former member for shrewsbury set up an action group because he recognise that the whole of the river severn be cohesive watercourse which require lot of effort and attention that role in the action group be now vacant and be wonder whether she would be enthusiastic to take it on she would have lot of support from all of those members of parliament represent constituent on what use to be the blue river severn which be now think bit red and orange in place think my hon friend be make good pitch to take on that role himself and would certainly support he in that none the less he be right all of we who live along the severn catchment and the river that flow into the severn have responsibility to work together to make sure that we make progress with the very wet weather that we have this winter we discover that some of the road that we accept will close once or twice year be now close more frequently have ask for an analysis from both our county council and the environment agency to explore the projection of the frequency with which those closure might happen be look to find solution to the situation with the hanley road outside upton upon severn and also the historic eckington bridge where the floodplain be also flood more frequently we need to see whether we need solution to these infrastructure challenge over the decade to come on the impact on local people wonder whether the hon member be like very concerned about the proposal of the conservative run newcastle under lyme borough council to build on keele golf course many of my constituent be very concerned indeed about the potential impact of flooding that may come with such development do she agree that when it come to building council have to factor in the climate and our natural world think the hon member need to have word with his deputy prime minister about that he and may share some concern about the ability of whitehall to determine where concrete be pour across our country let turn to two scheme that be still not build they be the subject of my adjournment debate back in think that we can make progress in this parliament on the tenbury wells and severn stoke flood defence scheme would like today minister to be the minister who see those scheme complete tenbury wells be the most beautiful town but it be build on floodplain century ago so protect it be very complicated project that comprise flood gate bund and wall after my adjournment debate in to my delight fund scheme be agree with million allocate to move it forward on top of that last year secure another million from the frequently flood community fund because inflation have take its toll and construction cost have spiral we be now in situation where some of those million have be spend on consultant and adviser but the flood defence scheme itself be still stick on the drawing board and have not yet go to planning ask the minister for an update on that severn stoke the clue be in the name be another community that sit on floodplain the village its popular pub its church and the busy road be frequently flood in fact the village hall have to be pull down because the parish could no long afford to insure the property the church be now struggle with insurance in the last parliament be pleased to win funding for that scheme as well include from the frequently flood community fund and arrange the transport of local topsoil to the place free of charge but would now also describe that scheme as stall in fact there be forlorn pile of topsoil in severn stoke that sit there while the village flood again last winter will the minister tell how we can get both scheme move again and importantly how we can get they finish in april have very helpful meeting with the environment agency chief executive philip duffy and the environment agency team have another one schedule for june but of course the general election intervene ask the minister whether we can reschedule that meeting at the early moment to identify how to unblock the two scheme know that the last government be on track to spend over billion on flood defence over the spending review period my hon friend be give an excellent speech and make very strong case for why we need to invest in flood defence scheme under the last conservative administration we increase the amount of investment in flood defence scheme from billion to billion over the next six year period do she agree that the new government should adhere to those funding increase so that we can ensure that scheme such as the one for which she be advocate be deal with and fund thank my hon friend for his intervention he point to fact that acknowledge cumulatively we have become more resilient to flooding in west worcestershire over the last year but there be still these two scheme that be go to be my next question to the minister will she confirm that the new government will continue with the same level of spending that my hon friend mention be there anything that could do other than lead debate such as this and meet with the chief executive of the environment agency that would help locally to unblock any of the issue know that these scheme particularly the one in tenbury wells be complicated just want the environment agency to be able to find its way through the obstacle the local community know that in order to make the omelette that be the flood defence of tenbury wells few egg will need to be break with few road closure at time and potentially some loss of road space down some side road just want to say on behalf of the community that it be prepared to put up with that level of inconvenience and some traffic disruption for while in order to protect its beautiful town as can be see from the other example in west worcestershire that have mention particularly upton upon severn the long term benefit of protect the town be immeasurable will the minister join in an effort of share persistence and determination to protect these two community by finally get the two scheme build preferably before the inevitable arrival of the next serious flood finally will she confirm that she will press ahead with the expand offer of the farming recovery fund farmer in my constituency and elsewhere think it be very important that the offer include those who experience damage due to extreme rainfall and not just those who experience flood land on that point will the hon lady give way have give way once already to the hon lady be go to allow the minister to use the remain time to respond call the minister emma hardy thank you and congratulation madam deputy speaker it be night of first be give my first speech as minister and we have you here for the first time as deputy speaker but of course we have the continuity of the hon member for strangford jim shannon be here to intervene in the adjournment debate as so many thing change so many thing remain the same long may that continue be delighted to respond to the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin who hold in high regard and esteem enjoy our time together on the treasury committee be pleased in my first debate as minister to be able to talk to she about something that we have conversation about before take this role want to state at the beginning that will be very happy to continue the conversation recognise that she request meeting and will be more than happy to follow that up the hon member allude to which we remember very well she talk about the challenge and the impact in her constituency and it be the same for in hull absolutely devastating as she mention people continue to feel the trauma which have long last impact not just on the economy and the state of people property but on people mental health therefore want to make it abundantly clear that this government be commit more than ever to protect community from flooding it be one of our top five priority in the department for environment food and rural affairs and the good news be that the work have already begin want to be as open and honest as possible with the hon member so have look in detail at the two scheme that be aware she would raise tonight although have be inform that the environment agency have complete some work since and progress have be make be sure we both want to acknowledge that these two scheme do seem to be particularly difficult recognise that she raise the same issue with the previous minister extend my sympathy to all the community of west worcestershire who be affect by the winter flooding which be an awful thing for anyone to experience enjoy and share the hon member persistence in fact believe that this place only work when we have persistent and talented woman lead the way so be absolutely with she on that let turn first to the severn stoke flood alleviation scheme understand that the hon member be involve in secure some of the soil require for the embankment my understanding of the situation be that if the scheme be complete it will well protect home and business and the rose and crown pub which have hear good thing about but the difficulty seem to be make sure that the scheme be within the funding envelope that have be allocate my understanding will make comment on the funding formula be that the benefit of the scheme as assess can not be great than the cost of deliver the scheme the funding envelope that have be allocate be base on the benefit that be mean to be give so the scheme have to be deliver within that envelope even though payment in kind have be receive in term of the provision of the soil that be the difficulty with that particular scheme the good news be that the environment agency be still work on find contractor it be still go out there and talk to organisation that could deliver the scheme within the budget available the hon member mention the role that she could play she have knowledge and experience of business in the area and that might be one avenue to explore with contractor who would learn the benefit that they would bring to the city and how they would be celebrate we would need to make sure that they could deliver within the funding that be provide that be the particular difficulty as understand it recognise the frustration that the hon member express there can be nothing more frustrating than to use her word forlorn pile of soil sit there do nothing share her frustration and hope that we can find the contractor that be need do the minister agree that many flood scheme have not be complete include number in my constituency of carlisle as direct result of the economic chaos create by the previous government which have force the environment agency to cancel quarter of the plan scheme it be great to see my hon friend in the chamber she be right the economic chaos that we face and which continue as we change government prime ministers and chancellors do not provide the stability need to get on with these scheme and deliver they the change that people require have now take place and we have stability and new ministers hopefully be not go anywhere quickly so hope we can get on and deliver hope that my hon friend will be persistent in pursue this issue have careful look at the tenbury wells scheme mention by the hon member for west worcestershire and how complicated the measure would be as she say it would potentially involve people have to move house and at time part of their garden be remove and road be close understand that the necessary consultation have be undertake with resident in the detail need nobody want scheme that will be expensive and disruptive or that do not perform as expect anything put in place must also be in keep with that beautiful part of the country as result design cost have increase repeatedly there be always the difficulty that we want something that be as good as possible at ensure flood alleviation design in the good possible way in keep with the character of the town and that cause minimum disruption my understanding of the situation be that the scheme have become much more expensive as time have go on that be something that we might want to discuss in more detail when we meet it be important that we get it right and that it be affordable give the amount of money that have be allocate be happy to take forward that conversation would not want to be the minister for deliver something that resident would not want to have in their community as the hon member will know from the national audit office report resilience to flooding which be publish last november we have inherit flood capital programme that face extreme delivery challenge as have be mention the nao cite number of project that have not go through partly because they could not be deliver within the timeframe partly because of inflation and partly because of covid and other challenge in government that have have an impact so be review absolutely everything that be go on in the environment agency and look at all the scheme want to update hon member on all that as quickly as possible and if anyone wish to see about individual scheme they be more than welcome to do so congratulate the minister on her new job she be do fantastic job so far and say all the thing that as neighbour of this scheme want to hear she talk about review the project and think we would all agree that there be no harm in that but it be probably worth bring up my experience just down the river from tenbury wells in bewdley where flood defence scheme be be put in place very successfully and be work well for the town and the community however one issue keep come up the disruption cause by have to switch to one way traffic on the bridge result in slight drop off in trade in the town it be very early day for the minister but as part of the review it might be helpful to reassure trader perhaps her department could look at not necessarily financial compensation but something that could help business that struggle with cash flow during lean period because of the work in order to get they through ultimately we will get far well economic value from town that have flood defence because it will not flood any more but in the interim this issue be problematic ask she respectfully to have look at that in her review so that we can help trader to get over the hump that difficult moment of the flood defence work thank the hon gentleman for his kind word and recognise the difficulty that these work cause to business that go to the point that make to the hon member for west worcestershire the design have to be right and work have to be do in conjunction with the community that be why work sometimes become more expensive however will take away the point the hon gentleman make on the funding formula say many time in opposition that be keen to look under the bonnet and now be delighted to get that chance for detailed look at exactly how thing work that be something be review as be always the case pull one lever can have unintended consequence elsewhere so hope the hon gentleman will forgive for not give the detail of exactly which lever intend to pull however be actively gain clear and transparent understanding of how the funding work who the winner and loser be under the formula that we have and our priority in my intervention on the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin refer to insurance premium if we sort the flooding out insurance premium will fall and there will be less cost that must be factor for constituent and their living cost be that something the minister will look at please thank the hon gentleman for his second intervention in this adjournment debate we be do well have be passionately supportive of the flood re scheme but it be mean to come to an end in and be look at that in real detail the whole point of the flood re scheme be that we would be able to build resilient property which would not be reliant on it but that have not happen think we need level of honestly about that so be look at the flood re scheme at the moment we want to ensure that wherever people live in the united kingdom they be able to find affordable insurance for their property that have to be priority in the last few minute that have will touch on one of the other big problem we face which be the maintenance of exist flood defence we have talk lot in this debate about the capital building and the need to build new flood defence but we have significant issue with the flood defence that we already have and it have be exacerbate by the problem we have as result of the two storm one of my big concern be the deterioration over the past few year of some of our key infrastructure that be another priority for in opposition talk about our flood resilience taskforce and what labour would do and be pleased to say that labour be get on with this as promise we will look to create the taskforce as soon as possible ahead of the wet season the flood resilience taskforce will look at co ordination across government and across agency on the ground and will work with stakeholder in fire and rescue service to inform policy and establish national standard difficulty often notice in opposition be with government departments maybe not always work together as one when they should to finish this government be dedicate to collaborate closely with the environment agency and of course the hon member for west worcestershire to advance the severn stoke and tenbury wells scheme in her constituency more generally however this government commit to work that will ensure that community throughout england receive the protection that they need especially as the risk of flood rise due to climate change salute she and every other member present for their persistence on this matter question put and agree to house adjourn
