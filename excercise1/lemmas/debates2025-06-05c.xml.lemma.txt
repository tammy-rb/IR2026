both engagement with china and with an issue like this we will engage properly while always bear in mind our own national security consideration the approach we do not adopt be to withdraw from engagement which the previous government do for number of year flip flopping from that to the previous era that they call the golden era we will engage with china when it be in our economic interest but we will always bear our national security interest in mind the previous government do not engage sorry they do not disengage at the heart of this be two simple fact first the government already

business be in agreement with many other that welcome the package with the eu it cut red tape and open up access to the eu market on operation brock the deployment be decision for the kent and medway

australia canada and uruguay he will know that last year youth mobility visa be issue to australian national to canadians and just to uruguayans will he be equally clear in set out what he think would be reasonable level for that cap or be it just matter of whatever brussels tell he he have to accept it certainly will not be it will be subject to negotiation genuinely welcome the opposition support for youth mobility scheme think it come as bit of surprise to some of their back benchers in that debate but none the less welcome it what have say and this be what the wording of the common understanding set out be that it have to be balance capped and time limited that be the negotiation we will take forward call the liberal democrat spokesperson be go to resist all attempt to involve in love in however the liberal democrats very much welcome the progress that have be make in the uk eu reset we be particularly pleased to see the prime minister listen to our long stand call on defence fund on veterinary scheme and on youth mobility or youth experience whatever we be call it now the minister know that be go to continue to press he on the matter we welcome the announcement but we need more certainty of the scheme scope and timescale be think particularly of those young people who want to start make plan for their future perhaps not for this summer but maybe for next

move forward as quickly as we can with implementation eu trading relationship what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of the new trading relationship with the eu there be no question but that the new arrangement we have with the european union will grow our economy it will put more money in the pocket of work people and the proof will be there for all to see as it ease pressure on food price and cut red tape more prosperity more safety more security but unfortunately it seem that the opposition position be to unpick all of that the government continue to celebrate last month late eu surrender deal continue their long term ambition to undo the result of democratic vote that their leadership have never agree with and be do its good to reverse at every opportunity the government have already prove that when labour negotiate britain lose can the minister reassure the house that this government have no further intention to surrender any more hard win brexit freedom the only thing that have be surrender be the credibility of the conservative party this government have use the independent post brexit trade policy to secure deal with india deal with the united states and deal with the eu that be good for job good for bill and good for border the conservatives will have to explain at the next election why they want to undo all of it relocate civil service

the country the aim be to bring the civil service close to local community and to bring good employment prospect to different part of the country welcome that reply and it be really progressive that the government be now relocate job away from london but can urge the minister to look closely at how people in place like my constituency of blyth and ashington people everywhere in rural and semi rural constituency as well as in more urban one can benefit from this fantastic policy we all need to be able to benefit from this policy not just certain people in city constituency very much hear what my hon friend say can not stand here and say that there will be civil service location in every single constituency in the country but we be happy to have dialogue with mps and local authority from all part of the country to get the big benefit possible from these decision to locate civil service job around the country the truth be in this day and age not everyone have to work in central london we can get well value for money and as say public service that be close to the public it serve particularly welcome the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster say that he would like to hear more accent from different part of the country in the civil service billingham in stockton north be home to the uk big biomanufacturing cluster and we be also somewhat expose to international trade with our steel chemical and automotive sector very much welcome the expansion of the darlington economic campus in the area of business and trade do my right hon friend agree that this will provide good job for my constituent in stockton and billingham and will he ensure that policy implementation be close to the source of economic activity we have the former prime minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak with we today he push for the darlington economic campus which be good innovation and know the current chancellor of the exchequer value it greatly we want not just to relocate job though that be important but to have thematic campus that can build up real area of expertise whether in digital skill financial skill energy skill and so on to make real difference to the community in which these office be locate thank the cdl for what he say because the darlington economic campus have be huge success it recently pass the milestone of job but crucially of those people be recruit locally provide opportunity for constituent in my rural area and across the north east as we have hear the darlington economic campus be also pioneer very strong cross government approach to working which be help to combat the strong departmental dna that the cdl mention will he join in praise the leadership team at dec for establish themselves as an indispensable part of government policymake and will he join in ensure that darlington can serve as model template for other campus across the uk join the right hon gentleman in praise the leadership team at dec he touch on very important point because we do not want just to relocate job we want people to have good career path too in some of the civil service office have visit around the country since last year people have raise the question can pursue career here that get promote it can not just be about relocation it have to be about the chance to build career in these place my party be pleased to hear the announcement that gb energy be come to aberdeen which we have consistently say be the only sensible place for it as member would expect an aberdeen mp to say give that gb energy will bring maximum of job over the next year will the right hon gentleman please encourage his ministerial colleague not to suggest that those job will replace the job fortnight that we be set to lose in the offshore energy industry over the next five year investment in renewable be an energy policy but it be also an economic and employment policy can assure the hon member that investment from both the public sector and the private sector will see many good new job create in new source of energy over the come year and decade welcome the relocation of civil service job across the country with recent study show that dudley have high level of economic inactivity what reassurance can my right hon friend give that young people in dudley will have every opportunity to build their career in the civil service whether through training apprenticeship or mentorship my hon friend will not be surprised to hear my strong enthusiasm for great employment opportunity for young people in the black country when we make the announcement about the relocation last week we also announce new apprenticeship scheme because we not only have to change location we also have to change recruitment pattern if we be really to get civil service that speak with all the accent of the country when the minister be move civil service job outside london may remind he that there be much more to the north than just manchester and leeds why be the government move the information commissioner office away from wilmslow to manchester and what assessment have be do of the impact of that move on the economy of wilmslow mr speaker as you can see this issue will prompt lot of member to stand up for their area and they be quite right to do so as we do this we will try to bring thing together in way that create real expertise and it be not just about city it be about other urban and semi urban area too the technology that allow we to move job outside london also allow we to do that intelligence and security

constructively with the committee and will continue to do so over the come month we have agree to the committee request uplift on budgeting and resourcing which should help it do its job properly over the course of the next parliament we be also work with the isc to identify the good operating model have the minister have discussion with the intelligence and security committee as to why our normally sophisticated operation have not succeed in make any significant dent in smash the gang and stop the boat perhaps he might ask the committee whether its view be that such be the pull factor and the desperation of these people that the only way we will stop the boat be to do what my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak be go to do arrest they deport they and send they back to where they come from be not quite sure that be the previous government plan maybe the right hon gentleman wish it be this be hugely important issue for we it be security issue as well as an immigration issue of course international policing and security operation to stop these gang and this trade be vital part of try to combat it call the shadow minister the intelligence and security committee of parliament be unique make up of privy counsellors from both houses however last month the committee take the highly unusual step of publicly criticise the government for their failure to allow the committee the staff and independence to fulfil its role oversee the circa billion annual spend for which there be no oversight capability the committee be lead by an experienced labour peer and it just want the basic to have staff who be not totally beholden to the cabinet office so that they can do their job on behalf of parliament and the country and to meet the prime minister the work of our intelligence service have never be more important give the grey zone that state be act within at the moment which must be properly oversee ask write question about when the prime minister would deign to meet the committee the parliamentary secretary cabinet office the hon member for erith and thamesmead ms oppong asare say that one be be arrange have that now happen also ask write question about the independence and resource of the committee and be tell that discussion be ongoing on matter of this seriousness do parliament not deserve more than fob off half answer and will the minister provide further detail now do not think the shadow minister listen to my first answer for the avoidance of doubt say that we have agree to the committee request uplift on budgeting and resource of course the prime minister will be happy to meet the committee at convenient time that both can agree civilian gallantry awards what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of increase the five year time limit for civilian gallantry award civilian gallantry award rightly recognise the bravery of people who put themselves at risk to save or attempt to save another person life honours policy be not the gift of ministers as it be oversee by the committee on the grant of honours decorations and medals however long stand practice over many decade be that the incident must have take place in the last five year and the only exception to this be where legal proceeding be ongoing thank the minister for her answer and for meet she know that have be support the family of pc taylor and ds hunt in the search for recognition of their bravery which result in their death some year ago they can not understand why there be committee to consider historic military medal but not civilian one it appear to they that one set of people who put themselves in harm way to protect our country can be recognise but another set can not appreciate what the minister say but can we look at institute an equal committee for civilian honour these family just want the proper recognition that historical administrative failure prevent they from receive know that the hon member be frustrate and have work really hard on this express my deep sympathy to the family of ds hunt and pc taylor be sure she will agree that it be good that their family be award the elizabeth emblem by his majesty in december in recognition of the sacrifice they make honours policy be not in the gift of ministers as mention it be set out by the committee on the grant of honours decorations and medals recognise that she have write to the chair of the committee on this issue and be sure he will reply call dr caroline johnson not here infected blood compensation scheme what recent progress he have make on establish an infected blood compensation scheme what recent progress he have make on establish an infected blood compensation scheme payment to infected people start at the end of last year the government expect payment to affected people to start by the end of this year the infected blood compensation authority which be independent of government publish update figure fortnightly as of june it have contact people to begin claim and make offer to people total million there be much furth to go but progress be be make in deliver justice to the victim of this devastating scandal in wirral west my constituent become victim of this scandal over year ago when she be child and it have affect her life ever since in her own word victim have go through horrible level of distress and now they wait for compensation that wait be not just for financial security it be for closure could the minister please give and my constituent assurance that the speed at which the payment will be make will be ramp up my hon friend constituent be entirely right to talk about the deep distress that victim have be through ibca be contact an average of people to start their claim every week and expect to have bring into claim all those who be infect and register with support scheme this calendar year will continue to support ibca to deliver compensation as quickly as possible the infected blood inquiry hear from black and asian victim who say that they be even more dramatically let down due to discrimination which have help to create an understandable mistrust of the authority and lack of faith that justice will be do please could the minister ensure that he do all he can to reach out to all community to encourage everyone who be entitle to apply for the compensation scheme to do so my hon friend be absolutely right about the need to reach out to all community and ensure that every single victim secure justice assure she that that be absolutely what the government be commit to do welcome the progress that be be make by ibca of course the minister be not directly responsible for how quickly that be roll out note that ibca have announce that its plan be to prioritise those infect who be still alive indeed my constituent daryn craik be contact last week suggest that the minister set up metric that ibca could agree to for the time between when people be contact and when they receive their payment he could then report that interval back to the house which would hold ibca to account on the delivery for these infected people who have suffer for too long again pay tribute to my predecessor as paymaster general for the work he do in stand up for the victim of this scandal he be right to raise the case of his constituent and about the balance between respect ibca independence and the lever assistance and support that ministers and specifically can offer to ibca would be more than happy to have discussion with he about his specific suggestion my constituent phill be one of the people in the special category mechanism who be suddenly and inexplicably exclude from the government infect blood compensation scheme when it be publish in february this year even though the government expert group have say in august last year that they should be compensate why do the criterion inform the eligibility for the scheme change without explanation and can the minister please provide list of all the condition include in the core award the hon lady be right to raise this issue component of the scm criterion be plan in both the core award and the supplementary route and those in receipt of scm payment can continue to receive those payment under the infected blood support scheme route however as say in my evidence to the inquiry only few week ago that be matter that will consider far civil service reform what step he be take to reform the civil service we want to see civil service that deliver for the public the reform that we be push through include great adoption of technology relocate civil service job around the country as we have discuss and critically focus on outcome in key public service area not just the process that lead to they many of my chelmsford constituent be civil servant who travel into london most day of the week to perform their job last month centre for economics and business research report reveal that the uk may need more public worker by to maintain the same level of output due to fall in productivity in the sector however the cabinet office have refuse to comment on report in recent day that the government plan to cut the number of civil servant by by the end of the decade which will have an impact on my chelmsford constituent will the minister confirm today whether cut to civil service headcount be plan and if any of that will take the form of compulsory redundancy it be fair to ask for productivity improvement from civil servant on behalf of the taxpayer we have have an increase in hire over the past year we do not have target for headcount reduction that be try under the last government and do not work but we do have target for reduction in admin and overhead spend we want to work with civil servant on how that will be do say to the hon lady that when the taxpayer be commit fund to public service we want to ensure we get maximum productivity in the public sector we can not just resign ourselves to lower productivity and the answer always be to hire more people how be the cabinet office work with the department of health and social care to bring down waiting list not just in blackpool but across the uk my hon friend will know that waiting list have fall by around since the election we set an aim of million extra appointment in the first year we have not have million extra appointment but million and the first year be not yet over we be work closely with the department of health and social care on that we know it be just the start it be good start but we have long way to go to get the health service back to the level that we want to see national resilience what recent progress his department have make on strengthen national resilience in april we launch the uk resilience academy we will be undertake full national pandemic response exercise that will test the uk capability plan protocol and procedure in the event of another major pandemic have engage with wide range of stakeholder to identify the gap as result we have develop new risk vulnerability map to identify area with high number of people who may need more support in crisis after decade of under investment in our critical mineral industry the conservative government have leave the uk wildly over reliant on chinese supply chain in order to strengthen our national economic resilience do the minister agree that the uk industrial strategy must support rapid acceleration of domestic production and processing of critical mineral my hon friend be right to highlight the industrial strategy which will be publish shortly it will set out our vision to deliver growth and economic security and resilience alongside that the government be work closely with industry to publish new critical mineral strategy this year to help secure our supply chain for the long term and drive forward the green industry of the future economic resilience be key part of our national resilience one of the strong way in which the government can have it be to support the delivery of good and service via british company in the first instance do the minister agree can he update the house on what step the government be take to bolster procurement policy so that they put british supply chain first this government be commit to work with and support british industry that have be at the heart of our plan for delivery which be why we have work across and engage with industry our industrial strategy be key to ensure that that happen topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility since our last oral question session the government have secure historic agreement with the european union that remove huge amount of cost and bureaucracy from our food and drink industry that back british job and that will help british consumer thank the paymaster general for all his excellent work on secure that agreement we have also set out detail of how we will reform the state move thousand of civil service job around the country and launch new apprenticeship scheme so that young people wherever they live have well chance of good work in the public service this week uncover the government shocking decision to designate the oxford to cambridge railway line as an england and wales project it be clearly nothing of the sort and the decision will cost wales million worth of funding for our own network will the minister commit to devolve full rail infrastructure power to wales in this parliament urge the hon member to have little patience until the spending review in few day time we get taste of it yesterday with the chancellor announce funding for major transport project around the country we be invest in public service not just in england but right across the united kingdom the hon member will hear lot more about that in few day time despite the majority of hereditary peer leave the other place and the limitation election on the opposition ability to appoint new peer the house of lords will remain disproportionately dominate by opposition peer why not tweak the fowler recommendation set new limit of and legislate for that in the last year of this parliament when that be block as it will be why not leave reform of the house of lords to be an issue at the next general election thank my hon friend for his innovative suggestion he rightly point out that follow the passage of the house of lords hereditary peers bill the opposition will remain the large party in the other place that bill which we be keen to see on the statute book as soon as possible be the first step in lords reform the government set out in our manifesto number of proposal to bring about small more active second chamber that well reflect the country it serve call the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster have already tell the house about plan for reduction in civil service number since he come into office how many civil service role in the cabinet office and its agency have be eliminate we hope to see reduction of around in cabinet office number over the next few year we have institute voluntary exit scheme which will make the management of headcount easier and will come into force very soon the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster very skilfully talk about the future rather than the past year will let he know that during the past year the number of role in his department and its agency have increase by that can not give the house great deal of confidence that his future cut will be effective will he guarantee that that be one off and that he will go back and ensure that the cabinet office be actually reduce in size the hon gentleman be part of government who regularly produce headcount target for civil servant that be about as reliable as the immigration target that the conservatives also produce have make it clear that we do not seek particular headcount target it depend on what people do we be try to reduce the overhead spend but we be prepared to hire more people when it come to frontline public service delivery that be why we be hire more teacher and get the waiting list down we be not adopt the hon gentleman approach therefore will not fall into the trap that he be try to set business in my constituency often complain about the shocking brexit deal that the conservative party give we with more cost more red tape and more paperwork that be why labour member welcome the new eu deal negotiate by this government can the minister set out how business in my constituency in loughborough shepshed and the village will benefit from our new grow up relationship with the european union my hon friend be absolutely right the package will cut red tape and reduce barrier to trade for business make it easy for business to export iconic product such as melton mowbray pork pie red leicester cheese and stilton cheese and open up wide access to the uk market

from the sublime to the sublimely incompetent this week have otherwise be one disaster after another for the government on monday we have to drag the leader of the house to the dispatch box yet again and she have to apologise yet again for the government flagrant disregard for this house of commons in brief out the strategic defence review over the weekend there be no more important issue than the defence of the realm it be uk wide long term all party matter and have always be treat as such yet the government choose to share the document not only with their friend in the medium but with the industry at least six hour before it come to this chamber or to opposition party it be matter of deep embarrassment for the government and raise serious question about the private sharing of financially sensitive information the leader of the house and the defence secretary be both honourable people and have no doubt that she have make the case every week in cabinet for do such communication properly it be just extraordinary that these two member of the cabinet be be hang out to dry every week by the year old in downing street you could have grant an urgent question every single day this week mr speaker such have be the deluge of important announcement prematurely make outside this house today it be free school meal yesterday it be the reannouncement of northern rail spending the only mitigate factor be that the government have be so incompetent in handle their slow motion turn on the winter fuel allowance that no one have notice anything else though we still await statement to the house on that issue as well what about the strategic defence review itself we should start by thank the reviewer for their hard work over many month know everyone in this house will want to do that but if we look at the hard substance of the review matter become more difficult first of all many of the announcement largely repeat the decision of previous government for example on submarine on aukus and on warhead secondly and most crucially where be the funding government ministers have tie themselves in knot over the last few day as to whether the of gdp target be an ambition an aim or simply to be undertake when fiscal circumstance allow or in the next parliament luckily general richard barrons one of the sdr reviewer be more honest say that the sdr financial profile the assumption against which the reviewer be work assume that defence will get of gdp in financial year and of gdp by no later than the great irony be that not three week from now we will have the nato summit which will call not for but for plus we be light year away from that commitment the awful truth be that real money will not begin to flow into the armed force until the defence industrial strategy and the defence investment plan be announce later this year hopefully in the proper way to this house that will be month after the government take office it be lucky that we do not have war in europe thirdly where be the threat to our adversary no extra cash mean no extra commitment no commitment mean no credibility and no credibility mean no increase sense of threat to those we face what do we know we know that there be war in europe in which russia be move man and matériel not merely to push on in ukraine but to threaten the baltic state ukraine have glorious victory in the past few day but we can not rely on such victory and we must support it in its struggle against russia what do we know we know that xi jinping have direct the people liberation army to develop the capability to invade taiwan by and we know that nato ally who have collective responsibility to each other in some case have long way to go before they be even at of gdp let alone instead of give real leadership and put cash on the table our own government be talk about ready the country for war while in reality they continue to dither and delay mr speaker understand that today be press association

to start with the fundamental make sure that every family have stable love home where no child lack food or warmth that simple dignity should be the uncontroversial birthright of every child as they

possibility child poverty be scar on our society it be mark of the failure of conservative members to grow the economy to spread success to work people and to deliver for the next generation the ordinary hope that tomorrow will be well than today the last government do not see the grow number of family in deep poverty as failure to be address but let be clear that the grow number of child on free school meal under the last government be an index of failure not story of success this government be determined to turn the picture around tackle child poverty and spread growth and opportunity to every family in every part of our country that be why today be announce the big expansion of free school meal eligibility in england in generation because we can and must end the scourge of child poverty today we be set out that we will give every child whose family be in receipt of universal credit the entitlement to free school meal that mean not simply meal in mouth but crucially money back

family more choice in how they care for their child and more opportunity to get on and live good life our expansion of free school meal be not just about the here and now it be an investment in our child future it set they free from the worry and strain of grow up in poverty leave they free to learn and play and to do their very good in school today announcement be not only anti poverty but pro learning know that member across the house will agree with when say that those two cause shine brightest when they shine together that be what the evidence tell we these meal need to be healthy school food standard have not be revise since but this government be act quickly to put that right that be why be pleased to announce today that we be work with expert from across the sector to revise those standard we be support school with the late nutritional guidance because the benefit for child of get decent healthy meal at school be huge with their attendance higher their focus sharper their behaviour well their grade strong and their future brighter that chance to succeed should be open to all that be the sort of society want to live in and that this government want to build but the kind of change that our child need be not the work of single day or single policy even one as important as this that be why today announcement be part of our wide approach and moral mission with the child poverty strategy the opportunity mission and this government plan for change we have already begin roll out school base nursery and hour of government fund childcare save parent up to year child be already eat play and learn together as our free breakfast club reach early adopter school save parent another year we be cut the cost of school uniform for million child save some parent in their back

ensure that every child whatever their background and wherever they come from achieve and thrive we be deliver the change that parent need and that child deserve the change that will break the unfair link between background and success once and for all that mean do everything in our power to end child poverty today we say enough be enough today we begin to turn the tide today the fightback that begin in july last year kick up gear we be act to secure bright future for our child and for our country too commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of his statement the truth be that the family benefit from today announcement be the same one who be pay for it because the same group of people be hit hard by labour national insurance increase labour promise not to increase national insurance but it break that promise and someone earn just year will now take home less as result of the tax increase someone on just year the exact sort of person who be suppose to benefit from this policy will lose of their income the government want to talk about the impact of the money they be give today on poverty but they do not want to talk about the impact of the much large sum of money they be take away disgracefully they have not do any distributional analysis of the billion that they be take away which be particularly target at low income household will the minister say how many household that will push into poverty will he finally admit what the figure be while free school meal be obviously welcome the thing that be be cut to pay for they be much less welcome for example the government break their promise to fully fund the national insurance increase for school and some have be short change by they also break their promise to fully fund the pay award accord to the institute for fiscal studies that leave million funding hole for our school under the last government although there be an increase in achievement across the board the big increase be in the low half of the income distribution that be much hard to achieve when the government have take million out of our school what else be be do to balance the cost we already know that the government have cut support for math science physics latin computing and cadet in school and get rid of the successful behaviour hub we know that nursery which the minister talk about be say they be on the brink because of the national insurance increase in fact the early years alliance say the situation be catastrophic we know that the department for education recently announce real term cut of to university teaching grant and it have abolish of high apprenticeship funnily enough they announce that during the recess now the education press be say that the next cost save measure to pay for announcement like this will be to abolish education health and care plan for everything other than special school will the minister rule that out today if he do not rule it out the whole house will hear and we will know exactly what be go to happen next turn to the number what be the real net effect of all this transitional protection be establish in to ensure that pupil who gain fsm would not lose they while universal credit be be roll out that have roughly double the proportion of pupil who be eligible from to however the department for education have announce that those protection will now end in september when the new policy come in by how much will the end of those transitional protection reduce the number of child who be eligible for fsm be right in think that it be by million will the minister agree he be look away to finally publish figure how many child who have be on transitional protection will lose their free school meal when they change phase of education will the minister finally admit to the figure there be another sting in the tail today because school budget be go to be hit that be how this policy be be pay for that be because fsm be the gateway to pupil premium funding the pupil premium be great achievement of the conservative liberal democrat coalition government and it be worth per pupil in primary school and bit over in secondary school as result of today decision school be go to lose that funding with million pupil on transitional protection bring with they about each school be go to lose the billion currently go to they in pupil premium funding will that funding be replace by this announcement no because today the government have for the first time break the link between fsm eligibility and pupil premium funding on one side of the ledger billion have be lose and on the other side of the ledger school be not get it back have wonder where all the money be come from and now of course we know ask the minister to spit it out how much will this decision cost school and how much be it save the dfe on similar point will the minister confirm that the government will apply the same approach to holiday activity and food which would also not trigger an increase in that funding be the same also true of home school transport and how be this all be pay for think we need little more detail opposition member have become rather cautious about positive sound announcement from this government for example the other day ministers be here to announce that they would continue the adoption and special guardianship support fund but it must just have slip their mind to mention that it be be cut by that be why we like to know the detail when we get positive announcement will end by ask some question about the fact will the minister agree to publish information on how many child be currently on transitional protection and how much the end of that protection will reduce entitlement to free school meal will he agree to publish how much pupil premium funding school will lose overall as result of break the link between fsm and the pupil premium just to ask again so that the whole house hear the answer will he rule out abolish ehcp outside special school yes or no can not believe that do not hear the opposition spokesperson welcome our announcement it be shame that when the conservatives be in government tackle child poverty be not consider priority feel little sorry for the spokesperson who claim to care about education give that his only policy be to give private school tax break indeed on the conservatives watch child poverty grow to record high and they wear the increase number in child poverty as badge of honour frankly that be shameful this increase in free school meal be fully fund and that be possible thank to the difficult decision that this government and the chancellor have have to take to get the economy grow and put the public finance back on stable footing be excited to hear the chancellor set out more detail next week that be despite the mess we inherit from the conservatives why have the spokesperson not take the opportunity today to say sorry for his government shameful record on child poverty he have nothing to say on education for our country unlike they we will not sit by and watch more child fall into poverty unlike they we be not offer tax break for private school we be deliver positive change for our country we be give child back the opportunity to achieve and thrive with this announcement we be ensure that every child no matter what their background get the good start in life interruption order call the chair of the education committee warmly welcome the expansion of the free school meal entitlement it be an evidence base approach for which many of we have campaign for long time it will help to close the disadvantage gap in our school tackle child poverty benefit child health and support child to learn hope the government will agree that every child who be eligible for this expand entitlement should be able to receive that entitlement whether or not child get free school meal to which they be entitle should not depend on somebody else make an application for they through complicated process the government know which family be in receipt of universal credit so be the minister consider auto enrolment for this expand entitlement that would be easy to achieve than auto enrolment under the previous entitlement and every child really should be able to benefit can seek the minister assurance that this very positive announcement be not an indication that other measure to reduce child poverty such as scrap the two child cap have be take off the table finally as london mp and former southwark councillor who be very proud to be part of council that introduce universal free school meal in we have see the benefit of that policy and be proud we have mayor who be fund universal free school meal for all primary schoolchildren in london can ask for confirmation that london will also receive the funding for this expand entitlement so it can be put to the benefit of far reduce child poverty in london thank my

government and we be today share in the joy of the tireless campaigner and struggle family for whom this announcement be such as victory for far too long far too many child in this country have go

attend school qualify for universal credit but then later get job or well pay job and therefore no long qualify for universal credit would that child then lose their eligibility for free school meal that could create real problem for many parent and present we with cliff edge be sure that be not the government intention but we need to make the position clear the hon gentleman set out the current position and what have happen in the past what we be announce today will lift more child out of poverty because more child will be eligible for free school meal he make number of point on breakfast

the child poverty strategy which will be publish later this year and an update in the house will be provide in due course as liberal democrat warmly welcome the announcement today stand on manifesto that mention this policy at the previous four general election and it be good news however it would be the good news if the minister could explain more about what he mean by fully fund refer the house

have talk about how widespread this change will be small number of additional people in england will be able to get additional free school meal be glad that the government have extend eligibility but it do not have the geographical reach that he be try to make out be he to remove the two child benefit cap that would have an effect in every part of these island reduce poverty in every constituency why be this issue be kick into the long grass he be make an announcement on free school meal but the government be refuse to make announcement on the child poverty strategy that be promise in the

housing the cost of energy bill or support more parent to work that think be the change that our country need welcome today announcement it be small step in the right direction but what we need be giant leap to end child poverty if the minister be serious about that he know what he need to do scrap the two child benefit cap that would lift child out of poverty the green party have long campaign for universal free school meal we know that the health education and productivity benefit would more than pay for that policy the benefit would be for every pound invest accord to

direction my constituency of harpenden and berkhamsted be often see as an affluent area but there be pocket of poverty charity often say that it be hard in those area because not only be cost high but deprivation be hide currently the two child benefit cap restrict universal support to two child push thousand of family into poverty therefore do these restriction mean that the third and any subsequent child would not have access to free school meal or would simply be in household that receive universal credit be sufficient to qualify can assure the hon member that it will be for all child in that household more broadly we be introduce breakfast club which be universal offer in every primary school across the country other measure in the children wellbeing and schools bill will

appointment of such an experienced and respected figure who have the skill and robustness to reform an organisation that have lose its way so fundamentally also welcome that at the committee request the chair of the ccrc have be add to the list of role for which the justice committee conduct pre appointment scrutiny the case of andrew malkinson who be imprison for almost year for crime he do not commit and peter sullivan who spend year in prison for crime he do not commit underline the importance of the ccrc role both mr malkinson and mr sullivan make application to the ccrc which be reject the failing in the malkinson case have be make abundantly clear by chris henley kc review our report do not rehearse the fact of that case rather it address the way the ccrc conduct itself in response want to highlight two key point in relation to the henley report the insufficiency of the ccrc apology to mr malkinson and the delay in the publication of the report it should not have take an independent review for the ccrc to apologise to andrew malkinson the public statement of the then chair helen pitcher after andrew malkinson acquittal be woefully inadequate and show worrying lack of understanding of the potential damage to the ccrc reputation and public confidence that would almost inevitably arise from failure to admit its mistake and apologise by fail to offer timely apology the leadership of the ccrc cause significant damage to the organisation reputation the ccrc statement give the impression that the organisation and its leadership be more concerned with defend their own reputation than offer an honest assessment of how they have fail andrew malkinson the committee be unpersuade by the justification give by karen kneller for the delay in the publication of the henley report the report be provide to the ccrc in january but not publish until july among the reason for the delay in publication give to we by ms kneller on april be that the report be draft that contain typographical error that need correct in an exchange of letter with the committee chris henley kc tell we that his report have not contain typographical error but that the ccrc have instead ask he to make substantive change to its wording and he provide we with evidence of that we also find it be inappropriate for the ccrc to suggest to chris henley kc that his report should not draw broad conclusion on the ccrc as an organisation base on his analysis of their handling of andrew malkinson case the ccrc leadership should have accept the gravity of the failing in the handling of the case and their wide implication we be far unpersuade by karen kneller and amanda pearce explanation that publication of the henley report be not possible because of the proximity of the general election when karen kneller and amanda pearce appear before we on april we provide they with an opportunity to respond to public criticism of the leadership recent performance the answer provide to the committee do not inspire confidence on the contrary the partial nature of their answer lead chris henley kc and chris webb crisis communication consultant employ by the ccrc to advise on the henley report and the response to it to write to we to correct point make by karen kneller on april both chris henley and chris webb make allegation that ms kneller have mislead the committee in the spirit of fairness the committee offer karen kneller the opportunity to respond directly in write to those allegation and incorporate her response into our report the allegation make by chris henley and chris webb serve to reinforce the sense that the leadership of the ccrc have continually fail to learn from its mistake and confront its failing with the seriousness require as result of our concern regard the performance of the ccrc and the unpersuasive evidence karen kneller provide to the committee the committee conclude it be no long tenable for she to continue as chief executive of the ccrc the conclusion the committee reach be far broad than just those relate to the chief executive and to the organisation as whole commissioner form the body corporate of the organisation and make the key decision with regard to the ccrc work and we be alarmed that the ccrc have operate without full quota of commissioner since we be also disappointed that the term of commissioner recruitment only require commissioner to work day per year the responsibility for the lack of commissioner recruitment in recent year be an issue for both the ministry of justice and the ccrc we make recommendation that the incoming interim chair review of the organisation should consider whether the term of appointment for commissioner the corporate structure of the ccrc and the commission relationship with the moj be currently appropriate to ensure that the ccrc have the resource it need to operate effectively understand that the term of reference of that review will be publish shortly during the pandemic the ccrc move to remote first as means of operation which it have retain that be out of step with the rest of the public sector and seem unsuited to the nature of the commission work we be particularly shocked that both ms kneller and ms pearce the senior leadership of the organisation only attend the office once or twice every few month we recommend that senior leadership should have regular presence in the office particularly in the light of recent event and the high profile criticism direct at the commission exclusively remote working be not suit to body that rely on investigation and challenge to correct miscarriage of justice the ccrc be hugely important organisation and the senior leadership could have do much more in their evidence to reassure we that they understand the seriousness of the criticism it have face and the need for an overhaul of the organisation to rebuild public trust and provide applicant to the ccrc with the justice they deserve for an organisation that be design to identify failure within the criminal justice system the ccrc leadership have show remarkable inability to learn from its own mistake the new interim chair dame vera baird kc will now conduct review of the ccrc and it be already clear from her public statement that she be across the scale and complexity of the task that she have be set include the issue raise in our report there be real prospect of change be make at ccrc and be hopeful that that will lead to well outcome for those who have be victim of miscarriage of justice very much welcome the appointment of dame vera baird however the culture that have build up at the ccrc around the remote first policy seem to have lead to very lax working practice after she have finish in the role of interim chair what be the future for scrutinise the ccrc so that it do not fall back into that sort of lax behaviour be grateful to my hon friend because although that be management point it be substantive one because the work do by caseworker within the ccrc require investigation and be sensitive and they have to be robust and thorough in what they do the collegiate experience that people get from work in an office together be essential to that similar body would expend at least of their time in the office those be the sort of criterion would expect to be address in dame vera baird review so we can go forward with an organisation that be fit for purpose thank the chair of the select committee for his presentation in his introduction he refer to the input from northern ireland do that involve the policing and justice minister and all the major political party to ensure that we have collective point of view on the delivery of the recommendation be grateful as always to the hon gentleman for his question all can say today be that the ccrc cover northern ireland and that any recommendation that come from dame vera baird review must also affect the other jurisdiction in which the ccrc have role clearly most of the point that we deal with in what be relatively short inquiry relate to england and wales but will ensure that northern ireland be not forget go forward welcome the statement from the chair of the select committee and the appointment of dame vera baird as the interim chair do my hon friend share certain incredulity that the ministry of justice take three year to resolve the fee that would be pay to commissioner and that the recruitment exercise appear to be take month to resolve what be go on there do he believe that the term of appointment for commissioner should be review to ensure that they can play great role in the day to day run of the ccrc thank my hon friend for that question see that the minister my hon and learn friend the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman be in her place and she be no doubt listen because there be some quite trenchant criticism of the ministry of justice as well as of the ccrc itself in the report in particular the feeling that both organisation have take their eye off the ball on overall governance when the ccrc be set up commissioner be in full time salary position and have substantial role in the running of the organisation they now work remotely part time and on fee pay basis my hon friend praise dame vera baird and would like to add that this be difficult job which may be why the review be take so long and why it take so long to appoint she the role need someone with both an eye for detail and the gravita to do it be confident that she have that but to leave the organisation in fit state she will need to do something fundamental about its governance and the commissioner will be central to that thank the chair of the select committee for his remark as member of the committee can attest to our dismay at what we hear in those hearing ask the chair to encourage dame vera baird to take robust approach to her review of the leadership of such an important public body thank my hon friend who be an assiduous and very qualified member of the committee and often put to shame in relation to my knowledge of matter anybody who listen to dame vera interview on the today programme this week in which she address several time the report and these finding as well as three other report that there have be over the past year will be under no illusion about whether she understand the scale of the task she face and have the skill to tackle it govern the marine environment environmental audit committee select committee statement we now come to the second select committee statement on behalf of the environmental audit committee mr toby perkins will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question and not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair and not the relevant minister front benchers may take part in questioning be pleased to present to the house the environmental audit committee report on govern the marine environment ahead of world ocean day and the united nations ocean conference next week there be an opportunity for the government to send clear signal that the uk be serious about protect our marine environment that be why the committee work hard to publish our report in timely manner to advance that effort be grateful to all member of the committee for their contribution this be the first inquiry that have be initiate and complete by this committee and it have be pleasure to conduct the inquiry together wish to record my and the whole committee huge gratitude to the staff of the environmental audit committee in particular dr misha patel who work tirelessly and swiftly to produce the report the committee initiate the inquiry due to the critical importance of and risk to our marine environment ocean regulate the earth temperature absorb carbon dioxide produce oxygen support biodiversity underpin diverse industry and offer significant cultural heritage and recreational value at the same time they be under immense pressure from variety of activity and those activity be govern by complex and fragmented regime of regulation and policy the committee hear that this lack of join up governance and effective stakeholder engagement risk the unsustainable management and potential depletion of critical marine resource in fact uk water be already fail assessment of their environmental health lead the office for environmental protection to investigate suspect failure by the department for environment food and rural affairs to take the necessary measure to achieve good environmental status of marine water it be great pleasure and honour for many member of parliament to watch the film ocean in the company of sir david attenborough yesterday we hear the prime minister in his warm embrace of sir david assert that his government would take nature seriously echo the importance of action on ocean ahead of next week conference the committee be in excited anticipation of the announcement that the government will make ahead of next week conference turn to the report finding in more detail wish to highlight four topic on which the committee hear detailed evidence and have make recommendation to the government the first be on bottom trawling while marine protect area cover nearly square kilometre of english water activity that harm marine life be still allow in lot of those area the film ocean refer to clearly show the devastation of the seabed cause by bottom trawling extractive and damaging practice undermine the very objective that mpas be establish to address while the government have indicate that they be committed to not have bottom trawl in area that damage mpa they have not yet set out timeline for implement the change every day we wait further damage be do to the seabed and crucial ocean ecosystem the committee conclude that damaging practice such as bottom trawling dredging and mining aggregate should be ban in offshore protect area beyond protect area at sea the committee hear that the overarch vision for how our ocean be use and manage be outdate and do not reflect the current or evolve pressure on the marine environment the current marine policy statement publish in for example seek to maximise the production of oil and gas that be clearly not the current government policy but it be accord to the mps the committee recommend that the government bring forward long overdue review of the marine policy statement to update it to ensure that it reflect current government policy and set out how decision will be make to balance marine exploitation and marine protection on marine spatial planning the committee hear that the marine spatial prioritisation programme should be key in guide marine governance and spatial planning of activity at sea such as protect area renewable development and fishing however it remain unclear what outcome be expect and what have be deliver by the programme to date we urge the government to clarify the scope objective and output of the marine spatial prioritisation programme to ensure that it effectively implement the government vision for the sustainable use of the marine environment change in marine spatial planning will have real impact on those who rely on the sea for their livelihood the government must ensure that traditional marine sector be support through these change to retain their expertise and support sustainable practice finally the committee hear that despite sign the un high seas treaty in september the uk have so far fail to ratify it this crucial treaty would protect marine life in the high sea by establish protect area in international water until the treaty be ratify by nation it will not come into force we urge the government to set clear timeline for introduce the require legislation for ratify the treaty before september which will mark two year since the uk sign it this would send clear signal that global marine protection be priority for the government and it would take the uk and the world one step close to real protection for marine life in the high sea in our hearing ministers confirm that it remain government policy to ratify the treaty but explain that not enough time have be find in the parliamentary schedule for legislation it be crucial both for the uk contribution and for the treaty to come into force that it be ratify we call on the government to bring that forward now while the urgency of the situation for the marine environment be clear there be an opportunity to turn thing around the evidence be indisputable and the government have number of policy tool and option at their disposal it be time to act to protect the marine environment ahead of the un ocean conference next week look forward to hear from the minister the government plan to safeguard our ocean for the future thank the chair of the select committee for his statement and congratulate the environmental audit committee for its excellent and thoughtful report on govern the marine environment key component in that be marine conservation and protection include the myriad specie live in that environment such as cetacean there be no humane way to kill whale and sadly the barbaric practice of hunting and kill whale and dolphin still continue do the chair of the select committee agree that the united kingdom can play pivotal role in end this practice with its global soft power and in treaty negotiation trade deal and fishery negotiation by put pressure on country like japan norway iceland and the faroe islands to stop this horrific practice in our sea and ocean once and for all the shadow minister make an important point know that the previous government wrestle with this and the current government will too it be not feature in our report but know my front bench colleague will listen and take it seriously thank he for raise that point thank the chair of the select committee for his statement it have be privilege to be involve in the committee work on this report do he agree that next week un ocean conference offer the government unique opportunity to take global lead on ban destructive practice such as bottom trawling in marine protect area as our report recommend thank my hon friend and committee colleague for her contribution absolutely agree the warm word we hear from the prime minister yesterday be incredibly encouraging but we need to see they back up with real action look forward to hear what the government have to say at the conference it be important that we negotiate strongly overseas but we must also get our own act in order in this country it would be valuable signal ahead of the ocean conference if the government commit to what we sign up to in opposition and in our manifesto and ban bottom trawling in marine protect area thank the chair of the select committee for his statement it be privilege to serve on the environmental audit committee while the uk government have commit to not allow any new oil and gas licence would like to see they go far the marine spatial plan still say that we should maximise production of oil and gas be that not outrageously out of date and be it not urgent that the government update the strategy so that we have join up policy to tackle the climate crisis absolutely agree we know that that be not the government policy but accord to the mps it be that demonstrate the urgency of update the plan which go back to it be update after brexit but it clearly bear no relationship to the government current policy we expect those who use the sea in different way to listen to the plan so it be important that the plan reflect current policy that be an important recommendation we make in our report and entirely agree with the hon lady thank the chair of the select committee for how he have conduct this inquiry and present the report to the house also thank the clerks and official who prepare the report under considerable stress we be very grateful for their work ask my hon friend to reflect far on the situation with the bbnj treaty speak this morning to the journal office the house of commons library specialist and the clerk of the house and it have become clear that the bbnj treaty be in fact lay on the table of the house on october and its day sitting period have therefore long since pass without objection it appear that the government be mislead themselves by say that they have to pass the implement primary legislation before they can ratify it and table the instrument of ratification at the united nations ocean conference next week do my hon friend agree that give that ratification by state be vital we be two short at the moment as understand it it be important that there be no statutory objection to our table the instrument next week and that we should get on and do it certainly think we should get on and do it my hon friend raise an important point about whether primary legislation be need it be clear that the government believe it be and the evidence our committee hear be that the government be try to find time for that my hon friend make an innovative suggestion and be sure the government will listen think there be agreement across the house that this be important it be the policy of the previous government but it be never bring forward it be the policy of this government and it have never be bring forward think we would all agree that it be tremendously important for ratification to take place thank the chair of the environmental audit committee for introduce the report and for mention bottom trawling my understanding from speak to the fish producer organisation in my constituency and across northern ireland be that they be commit to the vision of stop bottom trawling and think the feeling be the same across the whole united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland if our fisherman and fisherwoman have the vision to stop bottom trawling what be be do to ensure that other european country have the same vision thank the hon gentleman for make that point and for his attention to these matter the committee look in detail at bottom trawling and we hear from number of expert it be also important to say that there be devolved element we consider the question of whether the government plan should impose highly protect marine area on devolve jurisdiction the hon gentleman be absolutely right that we need consistency on this across the uk and that we must insist on the same from nation across europe and the rest of the world david attenborough have say that we know more about the surface of the moon than we know about the bottom of our ocean and the ecosystem that exist down there it be disturb that donald trump who sign directive allow deep sea mining can this issue be take up at next week conference to try to secure co operation on study the bottom of our ocean and understand the ecosystem before we do permanent damage that we might regret my hon friend characteristically make an important point be sure the minister hear and will consider it we comment on deep sea mining in marine protect area in our report the film ocean demonstrate how much we be already start to learn and the vastness of our knowledge gap in this area my hon friend be right that we must continue to invest the report talk about make sure that we have well datum and information and make sure that on global basis we do not allow further degradation of this crucial ecosystem bill present pension schemes presentation and first reading standing order no secretary liz kendall support by the prime minister the chancellor of the exchequer secretary john healy secretary shabana mahmood secretary bridget phillipson secretary peter kyle jim mcmahon ellie reeves georgia gould al carns and mary creagh present bill to make provision about pension scheme and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time on monday june and to be print bill with explanatory note bill en backbench business bank closures and banking hubs beg to move that this house recognise the importance of banking facility to local community and express concern over the precipitous decline over the past year note the change to banking habit through online service further recognise that for vulnerable people face to face banking be vital service and reduction of branch risk significant financial exclusion far note the impact of loss of physical banking on small business through lose productivity and lose footfall also note the innovative nature of banking hub as solution to loss of high street banking but recognise that financial conduct authority rule for their recommendation be too inflexible and call on the government to instigate review into the impact on community of bank branch loss and change to the regulation to ensure community have appropriate access to banking facility on february hold debate in westminster hall on high street banking and bank closure despite the fact that it be only minute debate it be incredibly well attend such be the demand for debate on the issue face almost every community and constituency that at its conclusion be urge to apply for backbench business debate so here we be this afternoon want to put on record my thank to the committee for grant such an important debate and to all the member across the house who co sign my application in particular the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey who co sponsor it this debate like the previous one be timely there have be precipitous decline in banking provision in the uk over period of four decade it have be partially drive by the rapid advance in technology which have see huge uptake of internet banking but we should not kid ourselves it have also be drive by desire from bank still rake in enormous profit to centralise and cut cost with no regard for the community they purport to serve community be be sacrifice at the altar of greed at the behest of bank that no long see the service they provide as profitable and as be so often the case the elderly the disabled and the poor who either can not cope with computer or can not afford expensive broadband be the one who have be hit the hard moreover the closure have far erode local economy with few visit to the high street be make and local business have additional cost link to such practicality as make cash deposit my hon friend mention the issue cause for business there be also significant issue for charity in my constituency many local charity and community group receive cash donation and struggle to find place to bank they do he agree that this be an issue for charity just as much as it be for local business that be very valid point my hon friend be right when we look at who suffer as consequence of these decision charity be way up there the regulatory framework in place to protect community have find itself totally lacking and that have be the case for some time that be the reason for this debate my predecessor for the old wansbeck seat denis murphy campaign vigorously alongside local people against the closure of bank branch in both newbiggin by the sea and guide post but despite overwhelming public support the bank close regardless both those community have be without their own bank for more than year since the financial conduct authority have be task with regulate banking service include branch closure congratulate my hon friend on secure this incredibly important debate last month the well use chiswick post office in my constituency close without notice meet post office ltd yesterday and it assure that service would be restore shortly do he agree that this volatility and uncertainty in the market be damaging to both local community and the reputation of financial institution that be massively important people be tell that they can rely on post office to replace the bank the vast majority of post office in our community be now run by single person and be not make profit they can easily just withdraw the service it do happen and it have happen lot of time in my career leave the community without anything whatsoever that be really important point which will probably touch on later in my experience of deal with branch closure in my constituency the fca power to force the banking industry to rectify the consequential difficulty be totally and utterly inadequate congratulate the hon gentleman on secure this debate the fact that there be so many member in the house this afternoon underline that this be very big problem that cross party political boundary and all kind of constituency harwich brightlingsea manningtree and other place in my constituency be lose their banking facility the government be spend money on try to revive harwich high street but neither the previous government nor this government have do anything to secure the banking facility that be the lifeblood of high street really welcome this debate be not sure that post office be the answer think we need to make sure there be proper bank on every high street do agree with that these problem be happen across community regardless of whether we be red blue green or yellow it be happen on every high street many of they have lose their bank they be go and it can not be allow to continue under the financial services and markets act the fca can require bank to consult interested party to consider the effect of closure and can ask the private sector cash machine operator link to assess the consequence of closure and to recommend where alternative such as share banking hub facility should be create to fill the gap congratulate my hon friend on secure this debate he mention that this problem be happen in every high street across the country and that be certainly the case in my constituency where we have see the almost wholesale withdrawal of bank in west norwood dulwich and brixton across the piece they be close where they close the bank often say we make our service available in banking hub in the local library for example the service be then poorly advertise and publicise and be not particularly convenient the bank come along few month later and say we close it because of lack of demand do he agree that the bank be take cynical approach and be fail to provide an adequate service to our constituent of course it be cynical approach the bank do not want to be on the high street they do not want to be support local community the very same community that have support the bank through the darkest of time that be the reality and that be why this debate be so important we need more regulation to support people in their community the hon gentleman be make powerful speech when the last bank in town close in community such as tenbury wells and pershore it be cumbersome process for they to qualify for banking hub he mention the role of the regulator do he agree that when the last bank in town close banking hub ought to be provide automatically there be definitely room for discussion in that respect we have get to make sure that people have financial service on the high street it be pretty simple link assess the consequence of bank closure but its objective be direct by the fca requirement and basically it can only assess community base on access to cash nothing else no other social discussion take place it be just base on access to cash congratulate my hon friend on secure this important debate in eltham our last bank have close but because we still have nationwide in the town centre the bank will not consider the option of banking hub that need to change do he agree that we need review of the criterion so that we can have chance of get the bank at least to co operate in banking hub they should not rely on nationwide of course agree the criterion lay down by the government the bank the fca and link need to be utterly overhaul to represent people in our community will come on to some of the point that my hon friend raise all of we in this house share the concern that the disabled and the vulnerable be lose access not just to cash but to service do the hon gentleman agree that it be high time we ask the government to ensure that the fca review its guideline on this my ask will be bit strong than that might get my backside kick but hey it will not be the first time will ask the government to insist on legislation that change the structure to what we be all cry out for it will not cost the government to provide service to the people who actually need they the number of bank that have leave my constituency have drive mad in the square mile of mid buckinghamshire only one high street bank be leave stand one of the most absurd thing that have hear multiple bank say over the year be oh but there bank just few mile away that might be technically true on google maps but to pick somewhere close to my constituency entirely at random see the economic secretary to the treasury in her place in high wycombe it take an enormous amount of time compare with how it look on google maps to get into the town centre and back again if one bit of the criterion need to change it be that bank should not be able just to say oh there bank few mile away they need to look at the time it take in real life to get from village to nearby town it feel really strange to agree with so many conservative members it do not make terribly comfortable but it show the power of the argument and importantly the support that it have across the house which be relatively rare the number of intervention that have take have mean that lot of the point in my speech have already be make will try to be as quick as possible link do decent job under the criterion that have be set which really need to be change link can pause bank closure but can not stop one or set its own timetable for the establishment of banking hub moreover there be no provision for the fca to initiate retrospective assessment of the need for banking hub in area where bank have leave the high street result in banking desert many year ago prior to the act the government simply must take fresh look at this issue and bring forward the necessary legislation to force the banking industry to fulfil its social responsibility the customer and community from whom they have extract so much profit over the year deserve nothing less we should not forget that these be the very same bank and financial institution that we have to bail out in because of their reckless pursuit of ever increase profit they then make fortune through the quantitative easing that the bank of england initiate to save the economy after the crash that they cause they be now abandon the very taxpayer who bail they out as mention there have be dramatic reduction in the number of bank on our high street in there be bank and build society branch in the uk by around be leave clearly the switch to online banking have have an impact but even those of we who use online banking sometimes need the certainty that branch offer the house of lords april report closure of bank branch impact on rural community quote sarah coles senior personal finance analyst at hargreaves lansdown the closure of bank branch be vicious circle the more that close the more people move online so there be few people rely on high street branch so more of they close the pandemic pick up the pace around this ever decrease circle close more branch temporarily and cause online banking to spike the bank say that few people be use branch if high street branch close people can not use it as it be not there any more do that not result in an automatic reduction in usage this be not rocket science it be vicious circle which be why we need change from the government northumberland my home county have lose more than half of its bank branch since in my constituency of blyth and ashington the large village have be leave without high street bank for more than quarter of decade blyth northumberland large town will be leave without high street bank in few month time though building society will remain the point raise by my hon friend the member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford the hon member have be very generous he mention build society and the nationwide problem be mention in harpenden the hard work of local campaigner have manage to secure banking hub despite our have nationwide do he agree that local community need access to full range of banking service that build society do not provide and will he join in thank harpenden town council and especially derek french who have campaign on this issue locally and nationally perhaps this could be an example that could help other town to find out how they could get banking hub despite have nationwide thank the hon lady for her intervention will cover some of those point mention blyth the big town in my constituency the third large town in northumberland bedlington see its last branch close just last month from august in my constituency only ashington the county third large town will have high street bank but many will wonder how long that will last who be affect by these bank closure like any change of this nature be it not the most vulnerable who find it the most difficult the fca research in set out how problematic the requirement to travel big distance for banking service be for old people and provide evidence for the slow uptake of online banking service by old people only last week my office be contact by an elderly gentleman from guide post his local bank close in he move to the branch in bedlington few mile away where he stay for nigh on year before that close then he move to the one in blyth few mile far away that branch be now to be close as mention early he be unable to access internet banking he do not have any family and he be unable to travel any further distance whether by use basic transport service or otherwise as other have say the hon member have be very generous his speech be make think about vulnerable customer and access to responsible credit for they just couple of week ago the all party parliamentary group on fair banking have roundtable actually online banking service do not help those really vulnerable people where there be sense of shame in potentially need small amount of help and support do he agree that that be something else that we and the government need to consider fully agree with the hon lady intervention it be up to we in this place to speak up for those vulnerable people we know that the bank profit and make saving from branch closure in january house of commons library briefing point to the major bank enjoy decrease in overhead cost through branch closure in hsbc report the high net profit among the large uk bank reach just under billion barclays follow with around billion and natwest net profit be approximately billion the big four uk bank barclays natwest lloyds and hsbc be estimate to have make combine billion in profit they be not hard up you know they really be not hard up that be why it be important that we as elect representative press that point home to government the fca current power around bank closure have be mention two or three time already and they go to the heart of the issue unfortunately the bank be law unto themselves the fca have no statutory power to prevent bank closure it can only seek to influence such decision through its guidance note on branch closure the fca guidance require bank to assess how closure will affect customer especially those with vulnerability use datum on usage trend consider alternative solution to customer need such as free atm post office and banking hub and ensure that customer be give clear information and that they be not mislead although the fca can not stop closure it can require pause in branch closure if it be not satisfied that the important matter that have just mention have be consider adequately give everything we be talk about think that approach fail legislative change be need to ensure there be much more flexibility in that guidance link be not for profit company that be charge with make access to cash available largely through atm it can charge for use its atm and be allow to charge more in rural area prior to the financial services and markets act the major bank run voluntary assessment scheme use link to carry out research into the effect of plan branch closure the act make the link assessment mandatory but do not significantly widen their scope the link assessment analyse the impact of branch closure in term of access to cash and outline exist and recommend new alternative such as banking hub in blyth which be northumberland large town the bank run out of cash over bank holiday weekend not many week ago blyth it be massive place do not have any cash can you imagine that it do not have any cash whatsoever simply because the cash machine run out and the morrisons supermarket cash machine be inside the closed store an hon member raise the point about have different cash machine in different place but if people rely on supermarket for access to cash perhaps as last resort and it close at pm or pm then they do not have any access to cash congratulate the hon gentleman on secure this important debate to expand on his comment about supermarket in wetherby in my constituency morrisons have the only cashpoint and they be outside but they have run out of cash by saturday lunch time that sound like the same sort of situation as the one we have in blyth there be cash machine outside and inside but the cash machine outside run out of cash there be people knock on the shop window ask the people who be fill the shelf to get some money for they from the cash machine inside how ludicrous be that how ridiculous welcome the point that the hon gentleman be raise there be also an issue with cash machine inside shop that may be open for long but they be stock from the shop by the cash receive in the premise there can be cash machine in shop that have no cash in they but link have to take they into account when assess whether there should be free to use cash machine in community totally agree with the right hon gentleman point like bring school kid into parliament down in one of the corridor there be an atm that say free cash and tell all the kid that what you get if you be an mp you can get as much cash as you want from here it free it free laughter and they all ask if can get they some cash before they go to their mam free cash there be atm where people have to pay huge percentage to get their own money that be an issue that will cover very shortly my own experience of deal with link see almost guarantee that banking hub would be deliver in bedlington just before the election but on receive the assessment no such facility be propose and instead worry local be ask to travel to nearby cramlington to conduct their financial affair that be not acceptable it be correct to say that banking hub be an innovative solution for high street leave without banking facility but link briefing note on banking hub publish on june say banking hub be share service that enable customer of any of the major high street bank to access basic banking service and advice from community banker hubs be deliver by bank own company call cash access uk and be currently operate by the post office the government have state that they expect banking hub to be open by the end of this parliament we be well on track to surpass that figure link have already identify need for banking hub across the uk and similar number of other cash service such as new deposit service over banking hub be already operational there be no doubt that that be progress but we need far more to provide the service that our constituent deserve the figure of banking hub might sound impressive but there be constituency represent in parliament in my constituency alone banking hub should be at the heart of the high street in ashington bedlington blyth guidepost and by the sea but at the current rate we will need time the amount be talk about by the end of this parliament our high street have be hollow out by online and out of town shopping congratulate my hon friend on secure this important debate in west ealing in my constituency we have see all the bank close over the past decade or so in fact the town centre itself have visibly decline in the way that he allude to do he agree that the labour government decision to permanently reduce business rate for retail and hospitality business and to end the scourge of late payment along with the banking hub that he mention will help revitalise place like west ealing agree that that will help to revitalise high street but the debate this afternoon be about how we assist the people in our community mainly the least well off the disabled and the elderly who simply want bank to use as mention our high street have be hollow out but we can share some community pride or indeed some community shame on this issue we can start move towards the former by move much need service like banking hub into the heart of the community that we all represent to do so we need proper regulation of the bank it should be abundantly clear to anyone who have pay any attention that the bank can not be allow to police themselves the fca need proper tooth and the financial services and marketing act should be amend to ensure essential face to face service be protect alongside access to cash during the debate on lords amendments to the financial services and markets bill before it be enact the then shadow economic secretary to the treasury my hon friend the member for hampstead and highgate tulip siddiq say be disappointed that the amendment will do nothing to protect essential face to face service analysis publish by consumer group which find that over half of the uk bank and building society branch have close since january shocking rate of about closure each month which risk exclude million of people who rely on in person service for help with open new account apply for loan make or receive payment and standing order official report june vol the labour party be proudly in power and be sure that we will address these issue we be now in government and it be time to take action we need to curb the power of the big bank once and for all we need to start review into the impact on community that be lose bank branch we need to change legislation to ensure that community factor and face to face service be consider when closure be announce we need to be bold with proposal for banking hub by direct the funding which should come from the bank themselves to create thousand of hub up and down the uk it be firmly in the remit of the government to do just that and urge my hon friend the minister to take the cross party support that we have see already today and consider the step to deliver justice to our community rise order we have shy of member hop to contribute so we will have hard speak limit of four minute to begin with thank the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for his persistence for secure this debate and for the work he have do and be do to get bank back on the high street perhaps we should be grateful to the banker because by their action they be the only group of people less popular than politician unfortunately in their endeavour to become the most unpopular people in the country they be do huge damage to our local community to put that in context since more than bank have close across the country and there be now only bank branch leave open in this country in fact we have more chance of find labour voter on farm than we have of see bank in rural community the hon member for blyth and ashington rightly point out that the loss of banking facility have leave vulnerable group such as the elderly and the disabled particularly affect and financially exclude so too be resident in rural area where internet access be poor and unreliable people struggle to get on to the internet to do transaction or for any customer assistance yet bank continue to withdraw physical service from their customer when we walk down most high street we see that bank have become cafés bar and pub will focus my attention on tatton and my local high street because the scale of the closure there be stark in knutsford we have lose santander barclays natwest lloyds and hsbc since and only nationwide building society remain knutsford be prosperous town with more than business operate locally there be high demand for banking service yet they have close their door in wilmslow the royal bank of scotland and tsb have close with only halifax and natwest remain which be also go to close that mean that only santander and nationwide will remain in alderley edge and handforth there be no branch at all force resident to travel long distance like the constituency of member across the house epping forest have see series of bank closure over the year tragically lloyds bank have say that later this year it will close its branch in debden in my constituency like the bank in my right hon friend community that branch be lifeline many people rely on it for face to face banking and will struggle to get to other branch do she agree that bank such as lloyds need to rethink and stop those closure and that the government and link need to step in and support high street banking agree the lack of bank be disgrace where do people go for their banking need the reality be that the bank that be close have enter into an agreement with business and individual when they open their bank account they open it with the bank on the high street the business be there because it expect certain amount of customer service that be why they go there in the first place face to face banking offer confidence security and efficiency especially for business hand over cash and make significant financial decision without those service it just will not work in the federation of small businesses find that four in small business still rely on cash as primary payment and six in need to make regular cash deposit regularly hear from business in tatton that they simply can not deposit cash or access the basic service need why well that be because of bank branch have close in the last decade and of cashpoint have go that be reduce the ability of business to deposit cash in the local area the shift to online pose risk from technical failure and cyber attack we have hear that through this monopoly and lack of access there be squeeze and commission be be charge for the transaction of these business our high street be at the heart of our community but without access to banking service our high street which be already under pressure have become even hard place to trade grow and thrive if we be serious about support small business and see investment on our local high street and in our town centre we must stop the decline in banking infrastructure some may argue that closure would be reasonable if bank be lose money and need to take cost cut measure but that be simply not the case bank be not struggle institution last year hsbc report nearly billion in post tax profit barclay make billion lloyds make billion natwest make billion those be all eye water profit order thank my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for secure this important debate too often feel the issue that significantly affect the day to day life of our constituent be push aside in favour of large headline grab national concern but this topic of access to banking service more specifically access to cash deserve far great attention than it receive while colleague here will be familiar with my no concern on the isle of wight ferry connectivity another issue come up repeatedly during the general election high street bank closure what strike most be just how deeply that issue resonate with people many of the resident have speak with feel very abandon by the institution they once trust with their life saving they be expect to navigate an increasingly digital world often without the necessary tool skill or support the result be grow sense of exclusion and frustration which be why the need for reliable in person banking service be not just important but urgent that be why be pleased to report positive development follow meeting with link last month banking hub have open in east cowes with plan for permanent hub in west cowes while do not claim that that hub alone solve the broad issue of financial inclusion on the island it be welcome and tangible step in the right direction however we can not ignore this trend and the anxiety that it cause our constituent across the country rural and coastal community be see their bank branch vanish from the high street in many case resident must travel mile sometimes without reliable transport just to deposit cheque interruption sorry madam deputy speaker be get overexcite accord to the financial conduct authority around million adult in the uk be unbanked that be million people without access to basic banking facility something that many of we take entirely for grant additionally one in adult have no cash saving whatsoever those figure should concern we all worry especially for the old member of our community report from age uk find that three in four accountholder age and over would prefer to carry out at least one banking transaction at branch those be not people resist change for the sake of it they be individual who genuinely rely on physical face to face interaction for their financial wellbeing they be disproportionately concentrate in rural constituency such as mine where the proportion of resident over the age of be nearly high than the national average it be imperative that we do not leave those individual behind this be not simply about preserve social interaction for its own sake we be talk about people livelihood their saving pension and financial security it be entirely reasonable for individual to want the reassurance of speak to real person face to face when manage something as vital as their money that be where banking hub come in these share facility provide practical community focus solution they combine the service of multiple bank in single accessible location support by the post office network they be staff by real people who can help with deposit withdrawal and even financial guidance banking hub be not just stopgap they be forward thinking solution that help we bridge the digital divide support more small business and charity that still rely heavily on cash and maintain community cohesion in town and village that increasingly feel cut off all of this have reinforce my belief that banking hub be not just temporary fix they could very well be long term solution restore vital financial service in the area where they be need most let we ensure that no community whether rural coastal or urban be deny access to the essential service its people need to live with financial freedom thank link and cash access uk for their work be most grateful to the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for bring this debate on banking before the house think bank closure affect every single constituency and every single person in the country as we will hear throughout this debate the final two bank in the town of wetherby close literally last month but we be lucky in the sense that we know those closure be come be work with the bank to get banking hub in for couple of year and it have be in place in the town hall this have give huge advantage to the town of wetherby because the bank that have close in the past be now represent again in that banking hub now that those last two branch have close the hub be go to take up residence in one of those ex bank that go to show that if we can get banking hub we have the ability to bring thing back to the community the bank that have close will have representative in there on different day of the week and as the hon member for blyth and ashington point out it be vital that people be able to have that face to face interaction however in other town in my constituency such as boroughbridge and tadcaster which have huge number of business there be no banking and there be no banking hub the resident of those town have be tell that they be close enough to go to other area but as have be point out that be not always the easy thing to do then we come to easingwold at the further end of my constituency nationwide with its policy of not shut bank still have its branch open so easingwold do not qualify for banking hub people be tell that they have to go to thirsk major town that be not easy to get to as the hon member for blyth and ashington outline there be problem with the excuse that not enough people be use branch and therefore the bank shut they down when branch have be shut down in the past and ask the bank can you please reconsider this they say well we only have few people come in last week we can not keep it open but they never actually do anything to encourage people to go to those branch they never give an indication that the branch may be shut and then they just shut it of course people then miss the service and the bank say there be one close by in another area as have be describe people be be charge to withdraw their money from cash machine as the hon gentleman say about free cash it be their money to start with but when bank tell people that they have to get bus to go to the bank they be also charge people to get their money out everything we be discuss pass on the cost from the bank to the consumer just to get their money out be lucky that have banking hub in my constituency other town be go to need they they do bring advantage but the way that the whole high street industry of banking be operate be cause huge disadvantage to people ultimately it be constantly charge they to get their own money out cash be still alive and well and for some access to it be still necessity indeed last year billion in cash be withdraw from the link network however with the rise and rise of internet banking and contactless payment we have see near complete withdrawal of bank branch from certain part of the country as have be mention there be branch year ago now there be just one of those closure be the natwest bank in bakewell in february it be not just the last bank in bakewell it be the last bank in the entire peak district national park in few week time when the lloyds bank in ashbourne close there will be no bank in the entire derbyshire dales constituency an area of nearly square mile there be many reason why people need access to cash all of which be ably demonstrate by the magnificent market town of bakewell of course there be resident there on low income or benefit who find it much easy to budget use cash and be less likely to have access to the internet there be an age population there who simply will not want to change or do not trust the technology we have have elderly resident take two hour round trip on the bus simply to withdraw cash from what be their new near bank rather than use the atm in bakewell there be several successful market each week the trader will all have electronic card reader to take payment with but despite what the mobile network may say people struggle to get signal in bakewell and trader often have to ask shopper to pay in cash there be also numerous independent shop that serve bakewell million visitor those shop need cash to run and when they queue up for cash at the post office they find that they be be ration as it simply could not cope with the demand despite all its attribute bakewell be turn down for banking hub the first time around when be elect go back to link which do the assessment and make the decision on banking hub over the course of several conversation try to understand what have be miss the first time around have to say that link be very responsive and after we have submit another application follow slight relaxation of its criterion on population size its representative be happy to come back to bakewell take they to the agricultural business centre to see the livestock market where the auctioneer demonstrate to they the staggering number of transaction take place use cheque this be glad to say seem to be the missing part of the puzzle back in december we be tell that we have be give full counter service banking hub it be the good christmas present ever the experience in ashbourne be completely different show that one size do not fit all the process there be seamless lloyds announce that it would close an assessment be do the criterion be all meet and liaise with cash access uk over timeframe location and so on be very glad to say that the permanent ashbourne banking hub will open on june and it look like the permanent bakewell hub will follow towards the end of july this will continue the excellent work and grow reputation of the temporary bakewell hub national cash access uk report suggest that over of customer believe that banking hub be extremely important to the community and the feedback that get from service user be all positive the evidence suggest that banking hub increase footfall and boost the local economy and be very relieved that we will shortly have two in the derbyshire dales the speak limit be now three minute call david mundell in that case madam deputy speaker will start with my ask of the minister which be that the criterion for assess whether there should be free to use cash machine in community be reassess for example in my constituency the bank of scotland close its branch in the community of moffat on the same day as it close four other branch at the moment link have to take into account every other cash machine in the vicinity regardless of whether there be any cash in those machine often machine in retail outlet be not fully stock with cash all the time they rely on cash come in through the till to go into the machine or whether premise be open for hour or be particularly disabled or vulnerable people friendly at this moment we can not get another cash machine because it have be assess that the number be sufficient without any assessment of those cash machine the closure refer to mean that for mile along the motorway from the border to hamilton you will not find bank branch when it come to bank building be take up by other have not be as lucky as my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey they be often very large building on small high street and unless the bank be willing to do something themselves there be not often other user the bank of scotland previously say that it would allow the peebles branch that be close to be for community use and the community have engage so be disappointed to hear that they find today that for sale sign have appear outside that branch hope that the bank of scotland will keep that community access my third point be that we need to join up what be happen the bank of scotland in sanquhar in my constituency be close the bank be put bank consultant into the community to look after its customer it say but that person will not be in the post office that have be designate by link as the effective banking hub in that community that person will hold separate meeting in council office there just be not join up thinking my final point be that we talk about post office when many people do not have physical post office but temporary post office deliver out of the back of van which be not capable of provide banking hub service the bank have more or less abandon my constituency and it sound like that be the case for many other some branch have close in recent year as have more than post office there be separate settlement in my constituency with no access to banking we do have banking hub it be an hour each way by bus to get to one and it cost at least six quid to get there and back represent large number of people live in poverty and it be hard for they to raise that kind of money just to have access to banking service will make two other point about my constituency and then general point the bus service be very poor as have just say it can take an hour each way to get to the banking hub and the banking hub do not provide all the service that bank should provide my other point about my constituency be that there be zone for the internet and of those zone be among the bad for internet provision in the country how on earth be someone suppose to access banking on an internet system that be simply not work it show the extent to which britain infrastructure be creak and it be not acceptable that bank should abandon the people who help to create they in the first place will just make this final point about mobility and accessibility one in four household in my constituency have no access at all to vehicle that be more than people without van or car to get they to bank even if bank be available it be disgrace that the bank have turn their back on all those people who be their loyal customer for so many year business that rely on cash and collect cash each day have nowhere to deposit it people be drive home from their place of work or their business with cash in the boot and nowhere safe to put it that be dangerous thing it be odd ideologically to hear member from the party of free enterprise and the free market say we have to do something about capitalism withdraw from community that be what be happen and that be the nature of capitalism itself we should just say that the financial sector in this country be worth trillion which dwarf our gdp of trillion the bank be worth eight time more than the total output of the whole uk as we have hear elsewhere billion of profit have be make by the bank in recent year it be time we bring the bank to order to serve our community order call helen morgan interruption sorry madam deputy speaker be so absorb by the debate that do not hear you call my name congratulate the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery on secure this debate which be important in my constituency of north shropshire there be five market town but only one will have commercial banking branch leave after the closure of the natwest in market drayton this year we find ourselves in situation of manage decline for rural constituent with essential service slowly remove bit by bit every year just two month ago attend the opening of the whitchurch banking hub which be provide vital service to town of around people that have lose its final bank branch while that be great news for whitchurch and the good alternative to network of commercial bank we must consider now those market town that do not meet the criterion set by link for example the lovely historic but quite small town of ellesmere in north shropshire have population of around people and commercial unit it be hub for large rural area and there be no bank and no prospect of get one accord to link because it do not meet the criterion ellesmere still have post office which be rely upon by local business for cash service have be the financial controller of business in an area serve only by post office can tell the house that people need to do more than simply deposit and withdraw cash although be big fan of prees post office and village store if need to change the signatory on bank account or set up new one it be logistical nightmare if do not want to post valuable and sensitive document it require half day trip to town with physical branch for someone in ellesmere the near town be oswestry to visit an actual bank in person be minute round trip on public transport someone live in the surround village be in difficult situation those resident might also have use their post office at some point but now those post office be be systematically close down in my constituency from knockin to hadnall and from weston rhyn to shawbury outreach post office have be close in one fell swoop with couple of week notice post office representative sound surprised recently when they tell that outreach service only available for one hour week be not well use it seem not to have occur to they that if the post office be only available for single hour that might not be terribly convenient have little time leave so will just say that for place with poor digital access where many people can not access online banking it be essential that we review the criterion that link use to assess the need for banking hub medieval market town that have be serve the centre of its community for hundred and hundred of year be on its knee because there be no access to banking it be essential that we get those service back into high street to revitalise town such as ellesmere and wem as soon as possible begin by thank my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for secure this important debate from farnworth and kearsley to walkden and beyond people across my constituency have see at first hand the impact of lose high street bank in farnworth for example last month we see natwest on market street close on may and lloyds on the same street close on may those be not just building but vital service that people have depend on for decade in walkden we be now set to lose the halifax branch on bolton road people be tell that they be worried about how they will manage especially those who do not bank online one woman in her late tell never think see the day when there be single bank leave in town gentleman in his early say he do not feel safe banking online and must go all the way into bolton just to do basic transaction these thing be necessity not luxury for they the issue be impact small business too especially small trader who trade in cash some be now force to drive out of town just to deposit taking that mean lose time lose footfall and more pressure on our already struggle high street that be why strongly support the idea of banking hub they be share space that allow customer from different bank to access service under one roof with in person staff available under the current rule farnworth which be undergo major regeneration do not qualify for hub because it have nearby cash machine few atm do not meet the need of whole town what people need be real face to face advice and service especially those who be vulnerable or less digitally confident the criterion set by the financial conduct authority be far too rigid they do not take account of the local picture the age of the population digital exclusion or public transport access million of people in the uk still rely on cash to budget and last year alone billion be withdraw through the link network that be person in farnworth local petition have be launch call for banking hub that properly serve the need of resident in farnworth and kearsley will the minister please review the true impact of branch closure on community such as mine will they reform the criterion for banking hub so that they reflect real life need not just cashpoint number and will they ensure that face to face banking be protect not just in principle but in practice it be about manage thing fairly congratulate the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery on secure this important debate in world dominate by contactless payment and banking app it be very easy for some people to live cash free and seldom visit bank but we must not overlook the million to million people who still rely on cash on daily basis these consumer be far more likely to be digitally exclude and financially vulnerable recently conduct cash access survey in my constituency some of respondent say that they use cash on daily basis and believe the government should safeguard the acceptance of cash as valid form of payment it be vital that access to cash and banking service be protect it be important for those who use cash but we must consider the resilience of the wide banking and financial system too we have recently witness major power outage at heathrow as well as large scale power cut in iberia we be increasingly aware of threat pose by hostile state that want to conduct cyber attack to disrupt our national infrastructure so cash and local banking service must remain accessible to allow society to function in the event of any major disruption this be matter of national security in bromsgrove and the village we be experience the effect of change in the way that people bank with the closure of lloyds and halifax bromsgrove high street will have lose four bank in just three year such bank be lifeline for so many small business particularly those run by independent entrepreneur as well as for local resident who rely on banking service every single day if we be not careful bromsgrove risk become banking desert with an increasingly empty high street know that bromsgrove be not eligible for formal banking hub so call on the minister to review the true impact of the closure of bank across the country and to review the criterion that community have to meet in order for banking hub to be provide in the limited time have leave want to draw attention to the further decline of high street and the important role that bank provide in draw people into their community bank often occupy some of the most prominent most beautiful and most significant historic building once they be vacant they be often leave empty and they become eyesore and further symbol of the deterioration of high street which affect so many of the community that we represent ask the government to review the criterion for banking hub and to focus on serious long term business rate reform that will enable high street to thrive into the future collectively as house of commons we must put pressure on the banking system to ensure that cash access remain part of our function economy and that as many of our constituent as possible have access to day to day retail banking service congratulate my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery on secure the debate south norfolk be no stranger to the creep erosion of our local banking infrastructure in january this year lloyds bank announce that it will close its branch in wymondham which be the last high street bank in the town that leave only single branch of the nationwide building society to serve grow population of over the day after the closure be announce on january secure an emergency meeting with lloyds bank and make it clear that without alternative provision the closure would have serious consequence especially for small business and the data bear this out lloyds bank own datum show that wymondham cashpoint use increase by between and that be not service in decline but service in demand it be absolutely clear that new banking hub must be up and run before the bank branch close next march be pleased to report that this have now be arrange and that the site be currently be finalise will continue to do everything within my power to ensure that wymondham be not leave behind however this issue be not limit to my large town in south norfolk loddon lose its barclays bank in long stratton lose its barclays bank in and if we be not careful the story will be repeat across every rural constituency in the country for rural community such as mine access to cash be not matter of convenience it be essential many of our village still experience patchy mobile signal and poor internet connectivity and when card machine go down or wi fi drop out it be cash that keep the local economy go we must remember that rural norfolk have one of the old population in the country many resident prefer or simply need to manage their money in person for they travel or mile to the near bank in norwich be not go to work that be why we need to be far more imaginative about how we can ensure that people have access to cash one idea be to reimagine how we use our post office and pub we all know that pub be the hub of our community in village life but too many be struggle to stay open let they provide additional service such as access to cash and postal service would be way to keep those hub of rural village life go community banking should not be something that we fight tooth and nail to preserve it should be the backbone of fair and function economy our rural town and village should not be tell that their need be out of date or out of scope will keep fight for that in wymondham loddon long stratton and all the village of south norfolk and know that many of my hon friend will be do the same for their rural community thank the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery and the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey for bring this debate before we today want to make few comment agree with the hon member for south norfolk ben goldsborough that access to banking service be major issue in rural constituency but it can also be an issue in urban constituency in part of my constituency which be wholly urban some community have be leave without bank owe to the way public transport work and its unaffordability in some place access bank can still be hard even if people live in community that be part of city so we need to make sure that we be look at this issue as whole in all the community affect public transport can be significant issue where capitalism fail we need market intervention that be what should happen we need more market intervention to ensure that there be at least minimum if not universal banking service number of the bank that have close in my constituency have say it okay because people will be able to go to the post office however the post office in seaton have close and we have be fight for year to get new post office in the community but nobody be willing to take it up that community be leave without either of those service and people have to travel in common with the hon member for normanton and hemsworth jon trickett significant proportion of my constituent at least third do not have access to car and get around the city and to the bank can be pretty difficult for they we have universal service obligation when it come to broadband and to royal mail delivery but we do not have they when it come to post office service and banking service yet cash be incredibly important the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell mention access to cash but that be not the only reason we need banking service there be some thing that can only be do in bank whether that be business deposit the cash that they have take people take cash out of cash machine or individual sign form to approve loan or mortgage some of those thing can only be do physically in the bank include thing that people need to do only once year someone live in banff aberdeenshire will have to spend an hour and half to two hour on public transport to get into the city significant length of time as the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke say early we be charge people for that privilege even though it might be free to withdraw cash the public transport that they need to take in order to get to bank be not free urge the government to look at the minimum service that people need in order to access cash and banking service that be close to they and that they can access by whatever method of transport they happen to have could the government please take action on this thank my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for bring this really important debate to this house and think we speak with one voice on this particular issue we both represent post industrial town and we can both see the decline of our high street bank have long be pillar of our high street in support local business sustain job and drive regional growth and economic stability in an increasingly digital age of contactless payment and banking app it be easy to underestimate the value of physical bank branch in our town centre with the ongoing closure of trusted high street bank many community be be leave isolated and underserved so banking hub can provide vital in person service particularly for old resident those with long term health condition and people at risk of economic abuse feel that we need to speak far about this subject and will write to the minister because economic abuse and financial inclusion be really big issue organisation such as link play key role in support the transition to digital economy have commit to ensure of people have reasonable access to free cash service however this commitment do not go far enough for area such as atherton and golborne two place with age population active local business and expand community in golborne of resident be over the second high area in the wigan borough atherton with busy train station and thriving night time economy still have no remain bank significant housing development in both area be far increase demand for financial service yet the infrastructure continue to shrink atherton resident often travel to leigh for banking leave their own town centre with decline footfall and empty retail unit although evidence base proposal for banking hub have be make recent link assessment do not recommend any new cash service in our area leave people exclude and unheard will the minister confirm whether the government be review the assessment process to ensure that such community be properly hear and their need fully meet in look to the future urge the government to consider the inclusion of credit union co operative model of banking such as the unify credit union in my constituency as part of their wide financial inclusion strategy point that have not yet be make be the importance of credit union and access to responsible lending one thing that people can do at high street bank but can not do at banking hub be get loan so be grateful to the hon member for mention credit union in my area nationwide on the in hazel grove have shut which be have massive impact on what people can do beyond access to cash agree with the hon member and unify credit union in my constituency do give out loan in an ethical way to community organisation and people who be struggle banking hub be not just about financial transaction they be also about sustain the health growth and regeneration of our town let we ensure that we be protect the digitally exclude support the financially vulnerable and do everything possible to keep our high street alive start as my right hon friend the member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell do with an ask of the minister as she will have hear this issue be apolitical and we be raise it very much because we care about our community can we increase the flexibility for banking hub to be roll out throughout the country apologise because should really have start by congratulate the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery on secure this important debate in south west hertfordshire have see the decline of high street include reduction in the number of banking branch nationwide which have be mention deserve credit for proactively retain its high street presence which do help my resident and be sure other across the country in rickmansworth in my constituency the local post office manager danny have step up and be now manage banking hub which allow my resident access to the frontline banking service to which they would not normally have access be also work alongside two of my councillor in abbots langley councillor vicky edwards and councillor ian campbell and hope the minister will encourage the power that be to see that where there be real need for community to have banking presence banking hub be an obvious solution if we want our high street to remain viable we need to encourage people to continue to come down to the high street historically that have mean service such as banking that will hope increase footfall for our local cafés hairdresser and all the other service associate with the high street we have hear about the bank that have close since be former retailer and understand that high street change but from policy perspective parliament need to create the framework that ensure high street be as we want they to be if we do not proactively encourage banking hub to be in the centre of our town yes atm be important but they be typically in place such as out of town petrol station we be not help small retailer and convenience store that rely on emergency purchase of pint of milk and the like will close because be conscious of the time with pledge from and hope those on my front bench that if the government step up and say they will increase the flexibility of banking hub they will have our support because cash remain king we have speak before about digital exclusion and it will have massive impact on minority of our population if we do not get this right thank my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for secure this important debate access to cash be important but it be only one part of the story the closure of bank branch strip community across our country not just of access to money but of access to advice and support service that can not simply be replicate online it go far than that for some elderly resident this be about sense of community and purpose such as the weekly trip with friend to interact with other plan food shop go to supermarket or even visit friend remember when be child when my grandfather be due to make his regular trip to the bank he would get suited and booted have haircut and tell we all proudly that he be off to the bank it be also the highlight of my week because always receive note afterwards in my constituency of gillingham and rainham be pleased to announce only last week that we will be get banking hub follow recent campaign for clarity we do have nationwide on site at the minute have hear directly from resident about how much this mean to they have receive numerous letter describe their struggle when they have not be able to access banking service many resident have describe long journey to neighbouring town often rely on friend or public transport just to withdraw cash or speak to somebody in person other resident have speak of the confusion and anxiety cause by use online banking that they neither trust nor understand we be talk about people who find themselves in effect lock out of the system simply because they do not use an app or smartphone these be real people in our community not small minority accord to age uk more than million people over have never use the internet and the access to cash review find that around million uk adult would struggle in cashless society many of they also lack digital literacy or the infrastructure to bank online this include people with disability carer those for whom english be not first language and people live on low income who can not afford broadband or mobile datum we should not expect they to adapt to system that be not design for they in the first place the reality be that high street bank have for some time be take decision base on commercial viability rather than community need understand that bank be not charity but the government do have responsibility to ensure that no one be cut off from basic service because they be not digital or because they be not profitable if we want to prevent digital exclusion from become permanent feature of our society banking hub must be part of national strategy that include ensure they be well promote well resource and available in all the place of great need be pleased that my constituency will benefit from banking hub but we need to go far the criterion need to change and we must ensure this be base not just on access to cash but importantly on the service that banking hub provide to community it be clear that we all care about our constituency my constituency of north east fife be well below the uk average in the statistic on access to cash the new power and obligation give to the fca under the financial services and markets act have go some way towards address these problem it be important to remember that everything happen before be voluntary we have twice go through the review process with link successfully in anstruther but frustratingly not so in cupar the anstruther banking counter be to some extent success story the bank close and the post office close but review be carry out and recommendation be make for counter provide cash deposit and withdrawal however there be some problem with the process that hope can be iron out the review be request by local organisation that have hop to provide space for the counter if recommend know that lot of its customer use cash and there be no nearby atm but it be not automatically advise of the outcome of the assessment and find out only after the fact that mean it do not get the chance to make an input to those make an assessment of possible location myself be not aware of the opening of the hub until hear incidentally from local councillor who be involve in the running of the location where the hub open if elect representative and the local medium do not know about counter open be very concerned that the public will not know either however the main issue which many have pick up be that the cash counter be not banking hub part of the picture as understand it be that we could have more support in anstruther if someone be willing to take on the post office but no one want to and have meet the national federation of subpostmasters early this year can understand why this be problem that the government need to address and hope the minister can do so in her remark what be the government do to make taking on post office more attractive they be vital to the success of banking hub but also the health of community more generally the other part of the picture as other have touch on be that the legislation only require maintain access to cash not banking service that be real oversight mention in my intervention on the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery congratulate he on secure the debate that the all party parliamentary group on fair banking give we some quite worry stat on the financial health of household income it be incumbent on bank to help people well manage their finance so that we do not end up with situation where people be in debt ask the minister whether the financial inclusion committee which she chair would look at access to banking service hope she will be able to update we on that today the last point want to make which other have mention be about the challenge around atm we have have big problem in leven where in just the last few week the final bank have close we have nationwide but it consistently run out of money and customer be really show their frustration whether it be more cashpoint or more replenishing of what be already there something have to be do the assessment need to take well consideration of what cash usage actually look like in an area congratulate my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery on secure this important debate in just the last two year bitterne precinct in my constituency have lose four high street bank and unfortunately nationwide building society add to that natwest in and now halifax and lloyds both close next monday these closure be leave community which by link own assessment count people among it with no branch banking provision at all we all recognise that technology have change the way we bank and mostly for the well but it be not always substitute for in person service people still need to deposit cash sort out complex issue or just get advice from another human being for too many this be not about convenience it end up with they be cut off let share some word from my constituent speak to in the precinct kayley former bank worker in thornhill tell some customer be unable to access online banking visit the bank be their only human interaction that day face to face service be imperative mandy from bitterne describe how her elderly blind mother break down in tear when she learn her local branch would be close mandy say banking in bitterne give she lifeline it keep her independence she do bank online because she can see the screen but she can still walk into bitterne to manage her affair frederick another resident highlight the rise cost of exclusion and wonder if we have really count that in he say banking hub would put money in people pocket by save they the cost of take ubers or bus just to withdraw cash link tell we that post office can be substitute but our local post office have no outside cashpoint and it can not cash certain cheque so when halifax and lloyds close next week there will be no outside cash access in the entire area and no high street bank on the entire eastern side of southampton therefore welcome the government commitment to roll out banking hub over the next five year but want to be clear that bitterne should be at the front of that queue it would not only restore access to banking but help other have eloquently make the point to secure the future of the high street support local business and protect resident from financial isolation hundred of people have sign my petition to bring banking hub to bitterne and many more have write to like other meet link have to share my frustration with the house about how the review be be conduct the link survey suggest that my constituent could quite easily take bus into southampton city centre in minute that be for the bird if they do it in the dead of night with no traffic on the road and ignore the speed limit then maybe but it can take up to minute to do that round trip let we set up the banking hub to succeed ask the minister how be we go to achieve that manifesto commitment when we be essentially outsource it to link let we invest in solution that do not leave anyone behind and let we bring banking back to bitterne commend the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for secure this important debate like so many place across the country bank branch have close at an alarming rate in my constituency not so long ago resident could pop down to branch of every major high street bank in the town of waltham cross cheshunt and hoddesdon just last week halifax become the late bank branch to shut its door in waltham cross while in hoddesdon the former site of the barclays remain empty scar on an otherwise vibrant town centre in my town of cheshunt town of people not single bank branch remain that simply can not be right the lack of in person banking facility be deprive people of access to vital service for so many old and vulnerable people it be cause huge difficulty and frustration as they be force to rely on digital service such as app and smartphone my hon friend make powerful point and particularly wish to draw his attention to the plight of blind people royal national institute of blind people research in find that of blind and partially sight people never use the internet they struggle with atm and they struggle too with travel to bank completely agree with my right hon friend it be really important that we expand the rule to get banking hub in more location across the country not least of all my nan do not do online banking every time go and see she she badger about it she will specifically bank with someone where she can have face to face service because she will not do online banking it be real struggle because some bank say well you ve get to telephone but even then one have to have smartphone to get code on the app for security so it be very difficult for our old and disabled constituent to access those vital service when barclays go from the high street in hoddesdon it do barclays local through the good work of my conservative run broxbourne council we manage to get it into the spotlight our local theatre but it be cashless that be nonsense its bread and butter business as high street bank be to deal with cash and get people access to its cash and banking service but it want to run service that be now cashless we try in cheshunt as say town of people with no banking service to get the natwest banking van at the car park of our laura trott sport centre but again it would only offer cashless service this be bread and butter to the high street bank they should accept cash and we should bring forward legislation to ensure that our constituent across the country have access to banking service we need to look at the rule because wait until the last bank be in our high street do not promote consumer choice or solve people banking and access to cash need on bus my constituent be lucky if the bus even turn up we get one bus once an hour so include public transport in analysis of banking hub location be unreliable we need to widen the criterion to enable more banking hub to be open up across the country congratulate my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery on secure such an important debate next week the lloyds and halifax branch in welwyn garden city will close their door to customer for the last time in hatfield we have already lose every bank branch from white lion square in the centre of town as we have hear today this be wearily familiar story in community across the country regrettably must start by share my experience with lloyds banking group on its website it talk of commitment to put customer first be afraid my experience on behalf of resident in welwyn garden city leave feel that we be just another cog in the corporate wheel early this year my office be inform of the closure of lloyds and halifax in welwyn garden city barely an hour before they hit send on the press release the management do respond to my firmly word letter demand meeting and in person make it clear that if the closure could not be overturn want to work together on bespoke option for community banking service suggest welwyn garden city library as an appropriate community venue and say if that option be pursue there should be no barrier to run regular service give the extremely low cost to lloyds of hire room lloyds need frequent chasing to respond afterwards and eventually come back with its standardised offer community banking service in the library but open just once every fortnight that be its national policy so welwyn garden city be in no bad or well position than any of our neighbour but be leave with the impression that lloyds be never serious about bespoke solution for our town if lloyds banking group be listen or watch today and want to think again will happily take call as soon as leave this chamber as other bank and build society close it be the role of government to accelerate the roll out of banking hub in hatfield we have temporary banking hub at the post office in white lion square and know that cash access and welwyn hatfield borough council be work towards permanent home some people will always want to have face to face conversation about their finance the hub model be here to stay service underpin by the state via the post office which we need in community across the country be equally convinced that the way bank and building society navigate this period of change might lead to customer be increasingly open to switch commend nationwide for its national commitment to keep branch open and note with interest that the current account switch service find last year that nearly million brits switch their current account with nationwide the beneficiary of the most net switch the challenge for the retail banking industry be to show they take seriously the need to engage with customer who want and need in person support and those who succeed might find that do good be good business however where business have choice to make government have an obligation let we fast track our plan for banking hub and redouble our effort to ensure that no community be without one thank the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for secure this debate one of the most meaningful moment have have so far as member of parliament be hear the elderly resident of nearby care home thank for secure banking hub in ystradgynlais that hub be now open and work provide an essential service to resident and small business many of whom be previously face long and expensive journey just to access basic banking service the local response have be overwhelmingly positive with many resident say that the bring back of those banking service be the first time they have see their community restore service in many year the opening of this hub do not happen by chance put on the record my thank to all the staff at link and the regulator who engage with we throughout the process they take the time to understand the community cash and banking need and seek to find solution their involvement be constructive and commend they for it that be how an effective regulator can make life well for ordinary people by rein in corporate greed if the government be look for way to win back favour surely commit to more banking hub must be one of they the government have commit to but in reality as we have hear the country need far more the demand be there and the model work but the current framework be far too restrictive have submit application for new hub in my constituency in pontardawe brecon presteigne and builth wells each of which have clear case we need system that support those application instead of hold they back through outdated rule and artificial limit in brecon we have one final bank branch remain in hay on wye town bless with bustling high street and number of independent business not single bank remain elsewhere in radnorshire presteigne see its last bank close early this year and rhayader be trouble by community banker who do not wish to visit it in pontardawe in the swansea valley lloyds be due to close the final remain branch later this year cite lack of footfall despite queue from the door to the counter all the while bank continue to report billion of pound in annual profit and rise dividend they say they have no option but to close these branch because of the digital transformation yet some of they cite statistic show that up to of their customer still need physical service the bank have fundamentally change their service offering who would now deposit their life saving with someone that offer to meet they in car park once week that be what charlie nunn the ceo of lloyds banking group have do to his customer in presteigne brecon ystradgynlais and now pontardawe he take home staggering million last year have close more than bank branch to save his company some overhead and manage to bump up the lloyds dividend by do he deserve that do he know the misery he have cause people in do so will he stop the closure of the pontardawe branch something that more than local resident have call on he to do do not intend to labour too long on rehash point that have already be make thank my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for secure the debate and the backbench business committee for schedule it it be very clear that access to physical bank be important for many people in our community my constituency like those of colleague present have not be spar the loss of bank in lichfield we have recently lose our barclays branch but up the road in burntwood we have much more difficult situation every single bank branch have be close for number of year the community have step up as it so often do in burntwood and the post office have fill the breach there be some access to banking service but that be not the same as physical branch as sit and listen to the debate today realise that there be one word that sum up the importance of this matter regeneration burntwood have high street that be almost ready to go some business be thrive and the footfall be massive but there be not the investment to make it kick on and become town centre of which the whole town can be proud in lichfield where the bank be more present there be thriving cafe culture although everything be not all sunshine and rainbow in lichfield and it never will be we can really see the difference in the two town centre what we be see here be almost an unvirtuous circle where high street start to struggle footfall drop off bank start to struggle and withdraw footfall drop far shop struggle more and so on it be spiral to the bottom the hon gentleman be become an hon friend what happen be that the bank encourage their customer to do thing online you can not open an account in branch where branch still exist and then say that online banking be replace face to face contact it be important to say that internet banking be not go away these two idea face to face banking and internet banking should be two side of the same coin all our high street bank should recognise that they have responsibility to both way of work prefer to bank online because be busy and spend half my life on train but there be people who do not have that luxury as they be technologically reluctant to engage hear many people ask the government what can we do to get more banking hub what can we do to encourage more physical bank that be something that would support particularly for town such as burntwood where bring those bank back could be that spark of regeneration the thing that start to reverse that unvirtuous circle so that it become virtuous circle where those bank be present and they drive footfall it be easy to get cash easy for business to bank there and easy for the high street to come back we all know that the high street be the physical representation of how people feel the economy be go one reason people be so worried about the economy be that our high street have be fail for decade government have not support high street for far too long and be proud that this government be say that they will now do so get bank back on to the high street where they belong can be that first step for town such as burntwood and the other that we have hear about in today debate thank the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for secure this debate in my constituency of farnham and bordon the situation be stark although welcome the fact that we have secure temporary banking hub in the shed in bordon on the hampshire side it rapidly need to have permanent location in liphook there be no banking hub no agree plan and no clear process for secure one across the border in surrey in haslemere we be fortunate to have one of the national hub up and run but in nearby farnham barclays have just go and santander go next month all this mean that more than people across my constituency have not single bank and only one building society constituent be right to be concern link the uk main cash access body have state that santander closure will have no significant impact on the community strongly disagree it absolutely will this can not continue to be postcode lottery bank be once embed in town and community but now they be be erase with little left behind banking hub be partial answer but the system need reform the process be slow the criterion too narrow and the scope of service too limited hubs must be locate centrally open five or six day week accessible to those with limited mobility and reachable without car they should serve both individual and small business and crucially offer face to face banking not just cash point and machine in society where collective trust be deplete do my hon friend agree that the presence of face to face banking service and banking customer be able to have direct in person relationship with real people be one step that we can all take to help rebuild collective trust in the institution that underpin society entirely agree with my hon friend he make very convincing point when we be deal with something as vital as personal finance it should not be too much to demand to see person face to face the legislation we rely on to manage access to banking include the financial services and markets act remain focus almost exclusively on access to cash not access to banking service that distinction matter deposit taking seek support with financial abuse and get advice be all service that can not be deliver by machine even when resident be confident and willing to bank online they be often hold back by something much simple their connection in many part of my constituency mobile coverage and broadband access be so poor that digital banking be unreliable if not impossible the digital divide be no long just social challenge but financial one too old people disabled people rural resident and small business all deserve access to banking system that work for they not just for those who be already digitally fluent or live in well connect area that mean that physical service in person advice and real access to cash must remain part of the infrastructure of modern life will the minister work with link cash access uk and local authority to accelerate the roll out of banking hub will she expand the remit of the financial services and markets act to protect access to full banking service not just to cash finally will she meet to discuss how we can support the roll out of permanent accessible banking hub in liphook and farnham no one should be exclude from essential financial service because of their postcode their age or the strength of their wi fi signal thank my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery for secure this important debate for five year work as support worker for child with autism across the north east and have many fond memory of his constituency in particular blyth beach the community we serve there as support worker often have complex need and in many way they be some of the people who be most vulnerable to the digital by default approach to public service like banking which have be one of the excuse for high street bank closure and one of the reason for public anger at the loss of service it be huge privilege to spend that time work with young people with disability and learn so much about humanity and community also learn about the state role as an essential safeguard and why we need to build inclusion and safeguard into planning banking be no exception have be really encourage by this government work on banking hub as way to mitigate banking closure but it be clear that far more need to be do while the debate understandably focus on more rural community echo the comment of the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman that it be myth that this sort of disenfranchisement be exclusive to rural area have see the barrier at first hand whether in my experience as care worker or from try to convince my young brother to change his behaviour he have autism and it be not the easy thing to try to get he to do something new change that and many other take in our stride be profound and insurmountable for some and urge my colleague in government to be ambitious in foster more inclusive service we should set the bar high for inclusive service in this country while be big fan of digital transformation and consider myself to be tech evangelist change can not and must not come at the expense of people who can not or choose not to engage the issue of high street bank closure in my constituency be keenly feel in worle despite the valiant campaign lead by the formidable jill leahy to keep the lloyds open on worle high street we could secure only short stay of execution and now worle be without bank to compound this the post office in north worle close recently what be leave be grow sense of frustration among resident especially old people and those with disability who may not be comfortable with use or able to use online banking for digital payment for they face to face service be not preference but necessity follow the campaign by jill local campaigner such as sally heap have recently be work hard to advocate banking hub in worle we be hop to be successful in that bid and have write to the minister to put my support behind sally campaign urge the government and financial institution to listen carefully to constituency and community like mine new banking hub in worle would be lifeline not only to individual but to the resilience and prosperity of the town let we make sure that our high street have future and that no one be leave behind in the rush to become digital first which work for many but leave some of our most vulnerable in an intolerable situation in the last five year bank branch have close in my constituency leave most town without traditional banking facility for example two year ago the closure of barclays in chalfont st peter trigger the assessment for formal banking hub while recognise that alternative provision be now deliver by the post office or in small pop up location on an appointment only basis those alternative do not go far enough they be unable to meet all need force people to travel far afield to find basic banking service and advice on mortgage and debt and as the minister will be all too aware ask people to rely on bus network that be increasingly cut service link find that chalfont st peter do not meet the criterion for banking hub yet one in five people there be over the age of and age uk find that of with bank account do not manage their money online some of my constituent in more rural area also face broadband connectivity issue restrict their access to online banking my plea to the minister echo the call already state to review the criterion by which town be assess for banking hub accessibility gap must be consider include access to broadband and whether resident have adequate access to not only cash the current criterion but in person banking service congratulate the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery it be an honour to speak about the impact of the decline of local bank branch which be an issue of such importance to my constituent the closure of the santander in rustington be just the late blow the need for robust and fair system of banking hub be urgent high street have change beyond recognition once we have barclays natwest and lloyds on every corner now branch have close since which be fall cash use may have drop to of payment but million still depend on it especially the elderly the disabled and the vulnerable in place like rustington entire community have be leave without local banking some be force online against their wish even when they can not afford the technology or can not physically use it at the same time they be increase their exposure to phishe attack my constituent roger mallock have lose life change sum of money to cyber scammer post office can not fill the gap the queue be long and they can not handle complex banking need or take large cash deposit despite my appeal to link rustington be deny banking hub raise the matter directly with the prime minister and the economic secretary to the treasury as one constituent put it bank be license by the government those licence should come with duty to maintain local branch consider ukrainian couple who come to bognor regis under the homes for ukraine scheme thank to the santander branch they open account and they continue to rely on in person support due to language barrier without it they would lose hour from work and face serious barrier to manage their finance they be not alone many elderly and less mobile customer depend on face to face service banking hub offer limited solution only hub be operational out of the plan and they can take up to month to open bad the fca rule be too narrow focus only on cash rather than on broad service the last government introduce the financial services and markets act which be start but do not go far enough banking be not luxury it be lifeline we must ensure that digital innovation do not leave million behind at the risk of disappoint the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery rise not entirely to criticise the bank which have do tremendous work on app and the like and many people not all of they spring chicken make great use of they but as bank retreat from brick and mortar location problem be that even silver surfer who be comfortable with the technology may simply not be able to get the relevant app to work in rural dumfries and galloway we have too many notspot where the mobile phone signal be sketchy at good and non existent at worst similarly there be lack of decent broadband the ground truth be that while it might be easy pc for some to get online sclerotic broadband and thick stone wall design to keep out the scottish damp make too many computer and smartphone expensive placemat the need for access to face to face banking service remain high as we have hear as we have also hear there be numerous issue with the current banking hub regime take wigtown in my constituency it be scotland official book town yet the current banking hub criterion fail to capture the significance of that wigtown be evaluate on its modest resident population with no account take of the huge influx of visitor when its famous book festival open its cover have stream of report of the town centre cash machine run out of spondulick outwith the festival and anecdotal report of people gather for trip to the near hub in newton stewart to lift their pension that hub be mile distant and notwithstanding our positively balmy climate in dumfries and galloway no really it be not walkable as for the public transport system let we just say that we need calendar and not stopwatch to time the bus when dalbeattie the third big town in my constituency with population of more than soul and slew of thrive business struggle to get banking hub surely there be compelling case for lower the threshold for hub accept that we can not have an ethos of wherever two or three be gather there shall be banking hub yet equally we can not expect one atm to carry the banking need of hundred if not thousand of people banking have come on in leap and bound since the day of little pen chain to counter and limited opening hour but on balance too many people be be leave behind in the technological revolution american banker felix rohatyn who rescue new york from financial disaster say banking be not simply about profit but about personal relationship even in this digital age we need to capture some of that spirit via our banking hub congratulate the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery on set the scene and on his introduction of the issue as an mp for an area that have be hard hit by the removal of bank first in rural village and now increasingly in even the main town of strangford the issue be incredibly important we need the regulation of access to banking service in legislation and to stop the drain towards online and city centre banking only million of people in the uk still rely on cash day to day in fact some million people in the uk remain unbanked and rely entirely on cash while more than million adult report that they would struggle to cope in cashless society yougov survey find that nearly of small business use cash at least weekly the british retail consortium have show rise in the use of cash for the second year in row to of transaction in as more and more people use cash to manage their budget in difficult economic environment while closing branch bank have manage to increase their profit by some billion it be clear where their focus be however once the bank be close and the profit be allocate to shareholder how will they continue to up the profit what service will be remove next the percentage of branch closure be low in large and medium sized town and high in village and small community at and respectively that be why the link criterion need to change be it not the trouble be that rural area be disproportionately damage by the fact that the population size be not big enough people can not get access to banking in the deepings long sutton donington and elsewhere in my constituency be sure it be the same in the hon gentleman the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that be replicate not just in his constituency and mine but probably in those of everyone here today those in rural area be twice as likely as those in urban area to depend on their local post office branch for cash and banking service with bank close and two banking hub opening we depend more than ever on the post office we have credit union but what we can do with they be very limited despite be very welcome while bank network decline the post office continue to provide free and convenient access to cash through its branch network however the branch in newtownards in strangford be set to close there be potential for that to happen anyway and that be absolutely devastating because the range of service that be not available in the local garage which have sub post office will only grow even the post office must therefore rethink its obligation through the banking framework that the post office have with uk bank and building society postmaster support over billion in withdrawal and deposit each month provide trust convenient face to face service at the heart of community however large branch such as the one in newtownards must be leave open if we be truly to have full service accord to age uk of and of rely on face to face banking nearly people over the age of say they be uncomfortable with the idea of bank online the age sector must be protect and the way to do that be to require legislatively well minimum service from bank and post office that be try to fill the gap but be pull back so what do want want bank to be require through legislation that they deliver for their customer want to ensure that the post office include the main post office be in place in my constituency and to see opportunity through credit union look to the minister to outline how the labour government will protect access to cash face to face banking and full service post office in each area it have be pleasure to be part of the debate thank the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery and the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey for bring it forward it would normally be customary with so many contributor to say that there have be wide range of view but do not actually think there have be there have be wide degree of unanimity on the fact that banking service in this country be in crisis the lack of access to banking for many of our constituent right across the country be lead to social exclusion limit entrepreneurship and have devastating impact on many of our local economy have hear from many hon and right hon member that service can not just be replace by online banking particularly for those who have poor digital connection in their constituency the difficulty of access banking be massive problem for those who be reliant on public transport those who be disabled and those who be elderly or have additional need it be good to hear how banking hub be make up some of the gap that so many community be experience but clearly there be lack of banking hub and they do not do everything need to close the gap in access cash or loan facility look forward to hear the minister comment on that the liberal democrats be strong champion of their local community we want to see the reversal of the damage cause to our local economy by the lack of access to banking one of the thing call on the minister to look at be reverse cut to the interchange fee pay to atm provider which would go long way to increase atm provision in many of our community the hon member for blyth and ashington give stark example of what happen when cash run out in certain town centre more need to be do on digital inclusion because clearly digital banking will be part of our future banking provision and for those who struggle to access it more can be do to assist they the liberal democrats call on the government to consider fair banking act to look at this problem in the round to think about bank exclusion not just for individual family and small community but for the wide business sector and to look at what more can be do to connect our community and business will close by add my praise to nationwide for its commitment to maintain banking service on the high street be privileged to join my local nationwide branch in central richmond just before recess the branch celebrate year of be on richmond high street while be there chat to the local staff who generously give some of the birthday cake many member of the local community be come in to do their banking face to face it be clear not only that it be good for my constituent to be able to use that face to face service but that the staff get great satisfaction from help customer and be that point of contact in the community other bank should be make available that sense of satisfaction to more of their staff and would like to see more bank make that commitment to community banking also congratulate the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery and my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey on secure this debate great strength of feeling about bank have be evident in this debate and it be important to remember the importance of bank not just to our community but to the wide economy bank provide service for business and individual but they also provide two other fundamental service first bank and building society take money from where it have accumulate and distribute it to where it be need for investment in infrastructure business and job secondly bank take overnight deposit and turn they into year mortgage so that our constituent can create home and build family which be quite difficult for bank to do the hon member for blyth and ashington make couple of important point that would like to address the first be about the profit that bank make and the second be about the policing of bank and the fact that bank apparently police themselves follow the financial crisis there be obviously huge number of problem in the banking system the financial services act create two regulator the financial conduct authority and the prudential regulation authority both of which and particularly the pra be responsible for make sure that our banking system be sound bank need to have strong balance sheet and to do that they need to make profit to certain extent agree that some of those profit look obscene and perhaps some bank could put some of that money back into our community none the less if bank spend their money unwisely we potentially run the risk of another banking crisis along with the right hon member for wolverhampton south east pat mcfadden be one of only two member leave in this house who sit on the parliamentary commission on banking standards from to our work on that commission underline the importance of bank in modern life about which we have hear so much today the commission find that hold and operate bank account be now essential to participate in society and the economy whether it be receive wage pay bill or access benefit but we also find that people view on bank be shape by their direct experience the more person know their bank the more likely they be to have confidence in it that mean that if bank want to retain their customer they must provide good wide range service an inability to access banking service risk erode that trust and confidence as we have hear today especially among the most vulnerable do my hon friend understand that people be very angry about bank closure and about the fact they feel that the bank just do not listen to they when they go through some consultation exercise that be why in moffat at pm tomorrow there will be protest outside the closing bank of scotland agree my right hon friend be absolutely right let we be clear that the decline of our high street and the decline of bank branch have run concurrently as behaviour have change over the last couple of decade and retail activity have increasingly move online bank be of course commercial entity and their decision to close branch be often drive by commercial imperative which be not necessarily what we want to hear in this debate fall footfall the rise of digital banking and the need to be cost effective be just some of those reason as we have hear so often there be now just bank branch remain in the uk and that number be expect to drop even far in come year atm number especially free to use machine have also decline only of payment in the uk be make with cash in and withdrawal from the link network be down on pre covid level the clue be in the phrase banking service it be about provide service to people as the hon member for lichfield dave robertson say bank dignify community too this be about personal interaction trust and building relationship that be what we do when we go into bank and we could never do that in the same way online my right hon friend make good point this be about face to face relationship not something do through an app behind the statistic cite be real people and real community the digitally exclude old people those in poor health and people with low financial resilience mostly rely on cash small business and rural community be hard hit the question for member who want to compel bank to keep branch open be how much digital first customer should be charge to retain loss make branch notwithstanding of course that profit question of course the answer can not simply be to do nothing and to walk away from our responsibility to those who be leave behind the previous government recognise the importance of maintain essential banking service as foundation for public confidence in this sector through the post office network we provide system of free and convenient access to banking service and the banking framework partnership between the post office and over of the uk bank and building society mean consumer and business can access basic banking service through the post office network the post office now have more branch than all the bank and building society combine and accord to the financial conduct authority post office branch make up more than of all branch base cash access point in the uk the last government also introduce banking hub which we have hear great deal about be conscious of time and do not want to incur your wrath madam deputy speaker so although have lot more to say think it would be prudent for to step aside and allow the minister to face up to the passion about this issue from member represent their community it be great pleasure to speak in this debate want to thank and to congratulate my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery on bring forward this important debate which be heavily subscribe across the house he highlight the need of his constituent particularly the elderly the vulnerable and the disabled my hon friend the members for weston super mare dan aldridge for bolton south and walkden yasmin qureshi and for leigh and atherton jo platt and the hon member for bromsgrove bradley thomas for farnham and bordon gregory stafford and for chesham and amersham sarah green all stress the importance of in person service particularly for vulnerable constituent congratulate my hon friend the members for isle of wight west mr quigley for derbyshire dales john whitby and for gillingham and rainham naushabah khan the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke and the hon member for brecon radnor and cwm tawe david chadwick on secure banking hub in their constituency in the case of my hon friend the member for derbyshire dales two banking hub be soon to open as understand it other members speak about their campaign to secure banking hub include my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey my hon friend the member for welwyn hatfield andrew lewin who be apparently expect call from one such bank and the hon member for broxbourne lewis cocking my hon friend the member for south norfolk ben goldsborough and the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan for dumfries and galloway john cooper and for strangford jim shannon talk about the importance of access to cash and banking service in rural area will the minister give way do not have very long leave be afraid the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman and my hon friend the member for weston super mare rightly stress the importance of these service in urban area as well will not go through all of they but we hear lot of really good speech on both side of the house and surprising degree of consensus which be not always the case it be interesting to see the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey and my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington so closely align which be not something expect through the financial services and markets act the last government legislate to protect reasonable access to cash give the financial conduct authority new power to ensure that community could both withdraw and deposit cash the government recognise that the ability to access cash and in person banking support remain essential for many particularly in rural area and for vulnerable people which be why we have secure the industry commitment to roll out banking hub by the end of this parliament ensure that access to face to face banking be protect over have be agree and more than be open banking hub be voluntary initiative by bank as part of meet their access to cash obligation as legislate for in fsma many member have ask the government to demand that link review its assessment procedure but it be worth remind colleague that the process for decide where hub be need be independently determine by link the operator of the uk large atm network the government be not minded to review the legislation pass by the previous government number of member include the hon member for dumfries and galloway who mention this to yesterday as well talk about atms lack of reliability have do little bit of work on that and link assure that it take hard line with its member over the functionality of atm however urge member to raise these issue with so that can raise they with link be soon to meet john howells the chief executive of link and will feed back the concern that member have raise today about how link apply its criterion know that this be not necessarily the conclusion to the speech that member be hop for but we think it be important that local community have access to cash and banking service which be why our government be commit to roll out banking hub across the country call ian lavery to wind up very briefly with the leave of the house will simply say very brief thank you to the backbench business committee for allow the debate and to everybody who have participate in it what my hon friend the minister just say be exactly right be someone who have be criticise by opposition members as left wing dinosaur wear it as badge of honour but that would hardly be say of my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey people should recognise that when someone with my politic and someone with her politic absolutely agree with everything that have be say there be surely something wrong question put and agree to resolve that this house recognise the importance of banking facility to local community and express concern over the precipitous decline over the past year note the change to banking habit through online service further recognise that for vulnerable people face to face banking be vital service and reduction of branch risk significant financial exclusion far note the impact of loss of physical banking on small business through lose productivity and lose footfall also note the innovative nature of banking hub as solution to loss of high street banking but recognise that financial conduct authority rule for their recommendation be too inflexible and call on the government to instigate review into the impact on community of bank branch loss and change to the regulation to ensure community have appropriate access to banking facility battery energy storage site safety regulations this be subject in which might have more than pass interest beg to move that this house recognise the unique challenge pose by lithium ion fire in battery energy storage site and call on the government to bring forward enforceable national regulation for their design and construction have ask for this debate in order to highlight important issue associate with lithium ion battery when deploy at grid scale these installation be know as battery energy storage system or bess in particular be call for clear national regulation that could be apply in the same way in every part of the uk we need legislation and hope that this debate will push the government far along the road to pass it the uk have set target to achieve net zero emission by to achieve that many wind and solar farm have be construct and permission be be seek for many more fully support the drive towards renewable energy the enhance regulation that be suggest today be intend to secure the industry future not to create more obstacle think it be perfectly possible to draw up regulation that will not stand in the way of bess roll out and which in the long term could actually save the industry from wholly avoidable setback in the event of an accident bess solve the classic question of what to do when the sun do shine and the wind do blow they provide number of highly useful function include load balancing peak shaving and energy arbitrage above all they make it practical to meet much large percentage of our national energy need from renewable however every energy system carry some kind of risk and most bess currently use lithium ion battery technology in the event of an accident and soon or later there be always accident lithium ion battery catch fire in different way from other material in process know as thermal runaway it be important to note that most bess now rely on lithium iron phosphate or lfp battery this chemistry be much more stable than lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide or nmc cell which be common in consumer us that mean few incident but those incident can still be dangerous in the future there will undoubtedly be other chemistry so we need to leave space for innovation thermal runaway generate very high temperature and require different firefighting method it be usually good not to try to put out the fire but rather to control the spread firefighter also have to contend with severely toxic gas emission the risk of an explosion soil contamination and damage to watercourse to repeat be in no way suggest that battery energy storage system be inherently unsafe the risk they entail may be different from those of traditional system but they be perfectly controllable do the hon gentleman share my concern that the location of many of these site be in rural area which be often serve primarily by retain firefighter they be long way from where specialist firefighting resource would come from and that do not seem to be take into account fully in the planning process appreciate the right hon gentleman intervention agree that such site can be in remote location where there be few resource as will say later in my remark fire officer training be very much part of what be recommend there be strong case for mandate water base suppression system off gas detection ventilation system and thermal runaway mitigation as design condition unfortunately that be far from the case today the guideline for planning approval be imprecise and vary across the devolved nation currently the burden of responsibility fall on individual local authority planning officer who have no specific training or background in lithium ion technology and why on earth would they for reason that be hard to understand perhaps the minister can explain fire and rescue service have not be make statutory consultee for planning application the current guidance state that applicant be encourage to engage rather than require to do so but even compulsory consultation be not enough by itself because the fire service themselves do not always have the expertise within the last fortnight henry griffin suffolk deputy chief fire officer ask for fire service to be give new power say like to see power that be akin to regulatory order like those for commercial property where we would have the power to enforce safety measure on those site he explain that the fire service be currently just contributing partner able to give direction and professional advice but not necessarily to require what it might like the result be inconsistency which be destructive both of public trust and of the success of the industry in my own constituency of horsham the local planning authority have reject bess application while similar site just half mile away across the border in mid sussex have win approval such inconsistency show alarming parallel with grenfell the grenfell disaster be the end result of many failing by both individual and company but at heart it be failure of regulation the rule leave thing wide open for exploitation by cost cut developer which be exactly what happen just as with lithium ion battery new technology in that case clad be be use at scale for the first time without proper understanding of the risk the time to act be now because the number of bess application be expand exponentially commend the hon gentleman for secure the debate he be right to highlight the issue around lithium ion battery and thermal runaway we be all remind of explosion and fire in liverpool in and in kilwinning in scotland in he refer to the need for legislation for the whole of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland but that need to start here be it his intention to ask the minister to confirm in her response that that will happen so that the legislation can then fan out to scotland northern ireland and wales the hon gentleman be well acquainted than be with the way that devolution work but yes hope that the minister will be able to set out whatever course of action be require to get to that point it be essential that we build battery energy storage site to proper safety standard so that we do not find ourselves face the need for massively more expensive retrofit with consequence for the entire energy network what accident have there be so far in september fire at bess site in liverpool create significant blast and take hour to extinguish merseyside fire and rescue service say that the blaze on carnegie road appear to be the first significant fire of its type to occur within the uk however this be only small bess with just four container and modest mwh output in total in common with the hon gentleman welcome renewable energy safety be hugely important in my constituency there be lot of battery site that be be place in pocket around beautiful little village because there be connection to the national grid because of the potential fire hazard and possible toxic run off into local river do the hon gentleman agree that we should prioritise brownfield site as oppose to such pocket around pretty little village the issue of site choice be closely associate with grid capacity so that be factor that be why some of these site be end up in otherwise somewhat improbable and very un industrial setting rule around the pollution of watercourse be one of the most important measure to be bring in and wide discussion of land use be go on that could help with that there be another accident in february this year essex firefighter deal with fire at bess project that be still under construction and therefore not even operate at full power the most serious incident internationally which cause serious injury be in mcmicken arizona in as result america along with germany have some of the most effective bess protocol in the world which think could be copy overall bess fire be high risk in their impact but low in incidence the faraday institution estimate that only one in million battery cell will experience failure result in fire that be an exceptionally high standard of safety but there be million of battery so there will be accident and of course in bess scenario one battery can trigger another grenfell be one fire in one building yet the ramification continue today it have leave we with the huge cost of retrofit large number of high rise building across the uk build with similar cladding method even single failure can therefore undermine an entire industry if it turn out to be the result of systemic mistake in design the uk regulatory approach to bess safety relie on performance base regulation such as the regulatory reform fire safety order and the building regulations they place the responsibility on the responsible person the site owner to ensure that adequate safety measure be in place but they lack specific provision tailor to bess too much reliance be be place on individual owner to mark their own homework the national fire chiefs council provide guidance for the fire and rescue service but that need to be more comprehensive and update constantly in line with change in technology if it be to serve proper regulatory purpose on fire response regulation recent change to the international electrotechnical commission standard suggest global shift towards mandatory water base suppression and proactive risk mitigation but that have not yet be echo in uk law there be also the environmental impact the environmental protection act and the water resources act provide general framework for manage environmental impact but again they do not specifically address the challenge pose by bess fire exist regulator do not seem to know whose responsibility this should be in recent application for solar park at cleve hill in kent which include battery storage the department for energy security and net zero state that the health and safety commission should be consult on safety advice but the hsc itself say that comment on battery safety management plan be not in its remit that confusion be not exactly reassuring it be important to note that if the battery themselves be not manufacture in the uk the government have limit scope to regulate however because battery be produce under controllable factory condition their failure rate be low the focus of uk regulation should instead be on the process that can happen in this country especially the design of the battery container and the overall site understand from the electricity storage network which be the industry group for electricity storage in great britain that it be currently talk to official at the department for environment food and rural affairs about new permitting system it be also talk to the british standards institution about lay down new standard for design and emergency response however the government have respond to all question from myself and other say that they consider the present regulatory regime to be robust be tempt to say that pride come before fall in the last few week spokesperson for the department for energy security and net zero have state battery fire at storage site be rare in the uk we already have high safety standard in place that require manufacturer and industry to ensure battery be safe throughout their lifespan that be just too complacent fire as result of cladding be also incredibly rare but that do not save life at grenfell and other have be ask for action for some time but so far without success it feel like the message still be not get through it be very concern that many question be pass from department to department with no one seem to be sure exactly whose responsibility it be because of inadequate regulation some bess unit have already be fit with inappropriate fire suppression technique which might actually make the problem bad but they be instal in good faith by operator look to do the right thing why be the government so reluctant to act hope that the minister will explain perhaps the government be worried that regulation would slow down the planning process but would argue that clear rule will actually make life easy for planning officer and councillor currently they have to grapple with complex technical subject for the first time each time that be too much to ask of non expert far suggest that it would be easy to win public consent if there be more clarity and consistency perhaps the government fear stifle innovation in new and rapidly change industry wholly agree that any regulation need to be carefully draft and have sufficient flexibility any guidance need to cover number of area include the transportation of battery to the site design and construction firefighting ongoing inspection and decommissioning in the short term if the government be for any reason still reluctant to regulate perhaps they could issue clear national guideline that be capable of be update annually enforcement might then take place through the insurance industry which would be likely to insist that any new application follow such guideline as no project can go ahead without insurance this would be enforcement by the back door grenfell be wholly predictable tragedy similar fire at lakanal house in camberwell which kill six people should have make we understand the risk but that warning be not heed and history take its course we can not go back in time to stop grenfell but we can act now to avoid make the same mistake again with battery energy storage system rise member will be able to see how many be stand do not intend to put formal time limit on but if member can keep their contribution below five minute everybody will just about squeeze in first of all support the fact that there be debate on this issue and support some of the point that the hon member for horsham john milne have just make it be clear that technology be move fast and when it do it be essential that public authority move even fast so that we feel properly secure and protect do not think we be quite there yet and it be clear that there be different pattern of operation by public authority in different part of the country we need an overall pattern also agree that we do not want to turn our back on this new technology it be very important that we continue to transform our energy provision across the country as whole but the fact of the matter be that the fire that occur from time to time pose serious problem for fire authority those authority should take central role in any national conversation about this matter guidance from the national fire chiefs council say that at least litre of water per minute be need to try to control fire once it get start that be an incredible amount of water to deliver and many site simply can not deliver it although they seem to be make progress in some case the government have say that there have not be many fire but there have be quite few the one in liverpool that the hon member for horsham mention burn for substantial period of hour and there be one in california that last for five day there have be three other fire in the uk this year and we be only halfway through the year when the fire authority be try to eliminate fire it be obviously complex but it can lead to pollutant go into the ground and into watercourse which itself be very dangerous it have be show that in liverpool when the smoke from the fire be spray by water it produce hydrochloric acid that be distribute through the community obviously not very healthy thing to have additionally toxic fume be create which travel long way will the hon member give way will but quickly the hon member be make an excellent speech he refer to the pollution of watercourse in my constituency the salmon fishing industry be hugely important to tourism and the local economy so that could be disaster wait to happen thank the hon member for his intervention and take his point entirely some authority have suggest that two mile radius be need if fire start people need to keep their window and door close while the fume be in the air as there be risk of child elderly people and other breathe they in in my constituency there be two application in place both in beautiful part of yorkshire in heath which be regard as one of the crown jewel of wakefield there be proposal for large battery storage provision hundred of people object to it the chief fire officer say the risk of vapour cloud thermal runaway and explosion be unfortunately very real and be become more common as we see an increase in battery storage he talk about choice be give to the fire authority in whether they allow the fire to just burn itself out with the risk of pollution of the atmosphere or whether they attempt to tackle it to control fire at the site in heath would require million of litre of water in hour period it be almost impossible to deliver that level of water and anyway what happen to the million of litre of water use to try to eliminate such fire there be second proposal in old snydale beautiful village in my constituency it be one road village and the people who live there work hard or have work hard the propose site will be almost next to the village and there be no road access or egress do not know how the fire engine and other emergency service would get in the proposal be completely inappropriate but the two community of heath and old snydale be sit there with planning application in place and the fire officer express great worry about the risk of potential fire and how they will control it without national guidance and proper regulation that be sensitive to the prospect of fire our local planning officer be have to reinvent the wheel as be other planning officer in other authority support the point make by the hon member for horsham john milne in introduce this debate congratulate the hon member for horsham john milne not just on secure this debate but on give it such wide range and thoroughly comprehensive introduction be sure that many member would have mention many of the area he discuss in their own way madam deputy speaker you and be very good friend and know that you have be concern about battery storage plant near the river test and potential runaway fire that may lead to pollutant go into the river as you be in your place you can not comment on that so think it important to get that on the record the hon member for normanton and hemsworth jon trickett be focus on some of the planning issue and that be where want to go too when we look at this debate overall what we be talk about be lack of statutory guidance want to get on the record immediately that this be not debate of forget net zero and forget about renewable that be not the debate and we be not denier along that road but there be serious concern the leader of my party have raise those concern and immediately be accuse of be anti net zero we have to take the concern seriously because as the hon member for horsham outline there be change slowly but surely in the material be use nickel manganese for example have vaporisation point of these fire can burn easily over want to focus my attention on the fallout have meeting with some soil scientist among other from the university of leeds at research facility in my constituency they be involve in all aspect of farming ask about research into potential contamination and fallout and what it could mean for soil if there be fire they say no such research have really be do and think they have couple of phd idea appear from that it show that that work have not be do where have we get to on thermal runaway as have be outline such fire need huge quantity of water it be not just about try to do whatever we can to stop the fire spread read in the international fire and safety journal about use high pressure water mist at the starting point monitor the potential for thermal runaway and try to cool the battery before they get to that stage equally if that mist be high pressure enough it can contain the contaminant around the fire again the science around this issue have to be closely manage as the hon member for normanton and hemsworth have outline acid and other thing can be create we have to be careful about the chemistry but we do not have any statutory guidance for planning authority we keep speak about what we need to do with water so surely it should be condition of the planning process that there be main water supply to where such incident be happen in my constituency planning application for solar farm and battery storage be pour in they be be approve and push on but there be no demand for water supply these application be for development in the middle of rural area on farmland farmer be be offer golden egg and tell sell we your land and we will develop solar farm and battery storage let give the example of planning application for wetherby service there be not really any objection or concern about battery but leeds city council then approve the development of hundred of house to metre away as have be outline no one know how far contamination go there must be lot more statutory undertaking for planning authority recommend pause on approve planning application until we fully understand what mitigation could be put in place for disaster which unfortunately do happen as the mp for south cotswolds and an environmental campaigner who have spend decade campaign for climate action would like to raise serious concern about the unchecked expansion of bess facility early this year bring the climate and nature bill to the house because believe in have fast fair and science lead transition away from fossil fuel but also believe in do so properly safely transparently and with community at the heart of the process unfortunately that be not what we be see in the case of the propose lime down solar farm in my constituency the lime down proposal would industrialise over acre of rural farmland and introduce mw battery installation right next to the railway line from london paddington to south wales that be not just visual or environmental concern but serious safety issue we have already hear lot about the low risk but very high consequence of fire at such facility if such fire be to break out the consequence would be devastating for both infrastructure and public safety member have already refer to many example of fire that have take place so will not repeat they but want to emphasise that the location of battery storage facility be absolutely crucial right now there be no national safety regulation tailor to good technology there be no requirement for thermal containment no mandatory fire suppression and no clear guidance for local planner under the government new planning and infrastructure bill bess project would be remove from national oversight altogether pile even more responsibility on to under resource local authority that do not look like thoughtful climate planning it be top down proposal on massive scale with too many unanswered question and too little engagement with the people who live nearby despite the obligatory consultation resident close to lime down feel understandably overlook in process that should prioritise both safety and consent we should look closely at the company behind lime down the developer island green power be now fully own by macquarie bank global investment firm with track record that should give we all pause for thought during its time lead the consortium that run thames water macquarie extract billion in dividend while let infrastructure crumble and river fill with sewage it be an asset management company its job be to make money and it do it well it be not public utility company it be not interested in home grow community lead energy it be interested in profit it be not here to protect the beauty of the british countryside or to invest in long term sustainability its business model be simple build big move fast and maximise return whatever the cost to people nature or public trust we need well alternative instead of hand vast development to multinational with sketchy record we should be invest in community own energy project initiative that be more resilient more trusted and far well suit to rural area such as south cotswolds project such as westmill solar and the low carbon hub have show how community can lead the way on clean energy cut emission while boost local economy let we not confuse scale with ambition our net zero future should be safe smart and fair not shape by the profit margin of distant shareholder we can and must do well if we be go to get to net zero without alienate the public and drive they into the arm of campaigner who would do away with the net zero enterprise altogether congratulate the hon member for horsham john milne on bring forward this important debate be grateful for the opportunity to speak in it because this be matter of considerable concern to the many rural community in the mid buckinghamshire constituency particularly give the safety risk pose by battery energy storage system let be clear from the outset this be debate not about the principle of energy storage although be in principle oppose to such scheme take agricultural land and challenge our food security but about and this be deeply concern and the house must urgently address it the real grow and too often overlook safety implication of these installation particularly when place in close proximity to village and rural road network that be ill equipped to support they the most pressing risk and one that have already lead to devastation elsewhere be the danger of thermal runaway as other have say these be not hypothetical risk they be document real world event in merseyside fire at battery site in cause an explosion that shake nearby home and require major emergency service response in arizona bess fire lead to an explosion that seriously injure eight firefighter and in belgium bess fire burn for over week and force the evacuation of nearby business these system contain highly reactive lithium ion battery when one cell fail often due to manufacturing defect overheating or damage it can cause chain reaction across the entire installation release toxic gas generate intense heat and create fire that can not be extinguish with conventional method in rural area where response time may be slow and firefighte resource more limited the consequence could be catastrophic in my constituency of mid buckinghamshire we be increasingly see application for these industrial scale storage site in rural setting near home farm school conservation area watercourse and river these be often justify in the name of green energy but resident rightly ask green for whom and safe for whom it be not just the risk of fire the cumulative impact of associated infrastructure substation cabling transformer enclosure often mean mile of narrow rural road be tear up by heavy good vehicle with last safety implication road that be never design for such weight and volume be leave with pothole uneven surface and subsidence for local motorist cyclist pedestrian and horse rider or schoolchildren walk along rural lane this pose daily and wholly unnecessary danger have receive multiple report from parish council resident and emergency service who be concerned that the access route use for construction and maintenance of these site be not fit for purpose my constituent in the claydons and in little missenden be at risk from convoy of lorry with junction visibility reduce verge destroy and road surface degrade if bess project plan for those area go ahead should an emergency arise at the site itself one have to ask would fire engine or ambulance even be able to reach it safely and quickly could the fire service even attempt to deal with such fire that be why be pleased that buckinghamshire council reject mw site in the claydons last year trust that other speculative developer such as the one plan site just outside little missenden will take note and spare my constituent from these unacceptable fire risk and road safety risk we must take more precautionary approach at the very least the government should introduce clear national guideline on the siting of bess installation include minimum separation distance from residential property fire resilience standard mandatory site specific risk assessment and restriction on place these facility on or near rural road urge the government and local planning authority to take these concern seriously safety must never be sacrifice on the altar of speed or ideology or the first technology that happen to be on the shelf that day our rural community in particular deserve well protection congratulate the hon member for horsham john milne on secure this important debate some of the new member may not know quite how much love the geeki possible debate have not have as much time since become snp chief whip so can not reach the geeky height manage by the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke in read the international fire and safety journal commend he on that but want to bring the debate to another geeky level and talk about the mechanism by which the government should take action there have be lot of talk today about plan mechanism and regulation but urge the government to look at health and safety regulation be from aberdeen and number of year ago we have the piper alpha disaster the piper alpha disaster and the cullen report that come afterwards result in massive step change in safety it be huge drastic change in how those thing work with health and safety regulation that apply across the whole of the united kingdom planning for example be devolve to scotland and lot of environmental rule be the preserve of the scottish parliament currently there be no health and safety rule in this area the house of commons library briefing for this debate state there be no law that specifically govern the fire safety of battery energy storage system it also state there be no specific health and safety law relate to bess have write to the health and safety executive scottish and southern electricity networks the city council and the scottish government about this issue have do lot around battery energy storage site the hse write back to say that it be member of the cross government group on battery energy storage so it be work on that it have landing page on its website that bring together some of the regulation of battery energy storage but most of they be write for the safety of individual battery rather than for the safety of these storage site that specifically be what be miss the health and safety guidance for battery energy storage site number of member have speak about local or uk wide issue but across the world there have be fire at battery energy storage site that be not small number or small percentage this be risky business do not disagree with those who say that these site be necessary we absolutely need they for our energy system in the future but they need to be safe we need regulation in place we should bring they together even if it be just the good practice from all different place to ensure that there be one place where the health and safety guidance be hold would be even more flexible than have it update by parliament would give the hse level of control over change and flex that guidance should more good practice come through again that would apply across the whole of these island and think that would be the good way forward want to mention two other thing first an early speaker mention that we have extreme weather event once in generation event just about every week at the moment it be really important that we look at both the extreme temperature and the flooding event that may occur as flood event at battery energy storage site be an issue whether or not there have be fire in advance of water leakage there could still be concern secondly want to talk about the money number of people be look at these site with dollar sign in their eye think we can build these thing and make whole lot of money actually we should be tell the organisation that be create the battery energy storage site that they will need to pay for the fire safety assessment consult the local fire service and pay for the training of the local fire team on tackle fire at these site think that would be the most reasonable way forward we should ask they to pay for that training because it be those organisation that will be make huge profit from the site it should not just be the public service that have to train up and increase the number of hour that retain firefighter perhaps be work think that be really important urge the minister to look at hse guidance as the method and mechanism for take this on have push the scottish government to change some of their planning guidance already particularly around notification of local community council for example but that health and safety guidance be think the key place to take action make that change and bring it together in one place so that all our constituent be safe as result be grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate thank the hon member for horsham john milne for secure it and for his comprehensive introduction would like to talk about this issue in the context of rural constituency such as mine as many other hon member have this afternoon first farmland be not just another piece of land but an irreplaceable national asset the ability to produce food domestically be fundamental pillar in our sovereignty and our national economic strength in recent year we have witness prime agricultural land be convert into sprawl array of energy installation with solar farm and now we have the increase prevalence of battery energy storage system appear in glorious countryside across the country my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton who be not present have raise this point comprehensively in the past as well as safety concern around battery energy storage system and the displacement of good agricultural land for energy production we be at real risk of displace this good agricultural land and of energy production facility become in effect new cash crop these facility area incredibly lucrative for farmer who feel stretch it be very difficult for they to make living in this challenging economic climate be pleased to be support the new clause to the planning and infrastructure bill table by my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills to protect agricultural land in the long term there be another point would like to highlight beyond those that have be make by many other member today we face the exposure of our energy supply chain to foreign country country that may not share our value and the long term depletion of our energy resilience if they manage to embed their infrastructure within our national energy infrastructure in the uk in weatheroak in my constituency we have be battle an energy storage application bang in the heart of north worcestershire green belt this glorious countryside will be fundamentally change forever should the application go ahead be grateful to tony williams the chairman of weatheroak resident association for have write to on numerous occasion have engage with many local resident who share the concern that have be raise today namely around the proximity of such site to village and the potential danger should there be an accident or incident whereby one of these site catch fire and the sparsely disperse rural fire service be unable to get there we also have the impact on road which have be pick up by my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith rural community across the country be face fundamental change in their identity at the expense of industrial application that be often grant at ease with little regard to the identity and character of those village know that this be concern that so many of my constituent share if have three ask of the government they would be that they pause the granting of battery energy storage system application in the first instance that they consider minimum radius for the proximity to settlement within which application can be grant and that they ensure that fire service across the country be statutory consultee in every case where there be an application for battery energy storage system of any size as you can see madam deputy speaker have come to the chamber with pre prepare speech but really everything have already be say thank my hon friend the member for horsham john milne for secure this debate also want to thank everyone who have contribute this sound like wind up speech but it be not whereas normally would email my speech to people who have approach on an issue in this case will just email the whole debate as it be publish in hansard because so many of the concern have be address flesh out and air there be proposal in my constituency way up in the north of scotland to have power line from spittal in caithness to lochbuie and beauly in inverness it be massive and there be lot of application for battery storage system it do feel as if the technology be race way ahead of the statutory authority of the scottish and uk governments and that we be play catch up we be be leave behind in cloud of dust and that worry enormously we have hear about the danger of battery fire of thermal runaway in the north of scotland where represent we be no stranger to extremely cold weather alnaharra in my constituency be always the cold place in the winter cold temperature can affect the battery they can change their lifespan and their mix there be phenomenon call dendrite which be form of crystallisation especially from lithium with tree like structure we do not fully understand where it come from do that play into what the hon gentleman be say about try to understand the stability of battery storage like other be leave in awe by the diligence of the research that have be carry out by the right hon member yes that be absolutely correct we just do not quite know what happen we have hear that if one battery catch fire it can ignite fire in other battery but will not go over that again where possibly high risk infrastructure be propose for community we must surely have mitigation and yes we should have complete consultation with the authority and those responsible in caithness we have only five fire station and they do not have enough personnel let alone faintly enough water to tackle such fire the authority want to build battery near the castle of mey where the king sometimes stay but they ai get the troop to sort that one out absolutely not totally endorse what be be say about the health and safety executive in scotland it should be hse the scottish environmental protection agency and the fire and rescue service take great heart from what the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman have be say thank goodness that this be be take seriously in conclusion we should not simply forge ahead with this sort of stuff until we know exactly what we be do to be helpful shall namecheck one person she be councillor in the highland she be not member of my party member can google she later and find out of which party she be member she be call helen crawford she have be bravely stand up say think we need to have way of structure this that take the community with we that do not seem that we be impose something from on high she be refer to battery grid improvement and so on nobody be say that they do not believe in get to net zero but let we take people with we when we do it drop little hint to the minister and the colleague of the hon member for aberdeen north in edinburgh that there will be meeting of large group of community council on june in inverness shire they be reasonable people and under scottish law community council be statutory consultee on planning matter would be very grateful if the minister would take look at what come out of that meeting because think it will be helpful to both the uk government and the scottish government let we have renewable energy but let we get it right rise to speak on the loom crisis face we in relation to battery energy storage site as member have explain the site be begin to play large and large role in the transition to green energy source but at the moment ideology be win the day and pragmatism be disappear there be over gw of battery capacity that be either operational await construction have be approve or in the early stage of the planning process for context that be enough power to supply nearly million home at once which be almost time as many as we have in the uk one of the installation that be propose but not operational be battery energy storage site just outside of grendon in south northamptonshire it be part of the wide green hill solar farm proposal own by island green power and note the comment from the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage on that this proposal expose how the government be asleep at the wheel on this issue the green hill bess be massive mw site propose for the edge of the town just few hundred metre from the centre and next to the beautiful grendon lake and the river nene on the border of site of special scientific interest the environmental importance and sensitivity of the site can not be understate the proposal be likely to come to the local planning authority eventually which understandably have virtually zero experience in balance the risk and benefit of large capacity bess the minister for housing and planning write to this week after raise with he several of the significant risk that the site pose to resident and the environment he say that the current regulatory framework be appropriate robust and future proof the hon member for horsham john milne have already allude to this comment be sure all member will agree that that sound rather good but the title of the framework that the minister speak so highly of be health and safety guidance guidance for grid scale electrical energy storage systems unfortunately for the minister he have expose exactly what be lack in our approach to bess our framework for regulate the design construction running and decommissioning of these site be simply guidance we have not grip the potential threat of these site and attempt to mitigate they thankfully there be example of where country have face up to the need to recognise the threat the united states be far along the path of roll out bess than the uk as we have experience here they have face large scale fire explosion environmental concern and understandably gap in expertise when it come to the emergency response to the unique challenge in response they realise that guidance do not suffice so they pass as the housing and planning minister sort of allude to an appropriate robust and future proof statutory framework that do simple thing it require co ordination with local fire service during the planning process it specify minimum distance from residential building it mandate elevation in flood prone zone and it enforce the training of the fire department and first responder to give they the expertise that they need that framework be prescriptive yes but when it come to the health of member of the public health threaten by these site in the way that member have articulate we must be prescriptive if we be not careful much like fire at battery energy storage site fire will be light that we can not put out and it will burn and burn ask that the government immediately pause the roll out of these site until proper regulatory framework be in place people in my constituency be worried they be worry by the constant stream of application for new battery energy storage system in and around the village across the constituency from kinver to swindon hinksford wombourne lower penn and the edge of kingswinford their worry be not exactly alleviate by the response the prime minister give to my question last month he do not give the impression that the government understand resident concern and some of the reason for those concern low penn in south staffordshire be lovely village with population of just under and it feel like pretty much all of they be in the village hall for the public meeting in february at least seven battery site have be either approve or propose in or close to that small village the same be happen in village across south staffordshire as have be sit in the chamber for this debate have receive another email from the planning authority invite to speak on one these application which be come through at such rate that reflect the position across the country there be operational battery energy storage system in the united kingdom but over more be in the pipeline so we really be at tipping point but the planning and regulatory system have not yet catch up that be why we need action as have be say such battery have low failure rate but sometimes they go wrong just as they do in mobile phone and electric vehicle that be why airline tell we we can not charge our mobile phone battery while we be on flight and it be why parliament have decide that electric vehicle can not be charge in the underground car park it be not because the risk be high it be because the consequence of thing go wrong can be catastrophic whereas mobile phone may have capacity of to watt hour and an electric vehicle battery perhaps to kw hour the site in tilbury the site of the fire early this year which think the hon member for horsham john milne refer to when complete will have capacity of about mw hour to put it another way that site will be the equivalent of million iphone battery as we see an increase in these site we know from basic statistic that there will be more fire on top of those we have already have this year in tilbury cirencester and aberdeenshire we therefore need to ensure that our system be properly adapt and modernise to reflect those risk the risk of fire be not only about the potential danger to human life for both those who may be nearby and the firefighter who be send to bring those fire under control over what may be or hour but about our local natural environment do my hon friend agree that one of the issue be that there be no statutory requirement on prevention method that may stop we from get to that disastrous situation in the first place my right hon friend be completely right part of the problem be that the planning application that come in be often very vague about exactly what lithium ion type chemical and technology will be use because they be often make year in advance and therefore before the product that will be on site have be acquire in those circumstance it be impossible to assess the risk properly when these fire run for or hour and million of gallon of water be use to bring they under control the chemical run off have to go somewhere and sadly many of these application include those in my constituency be for site near to our river and our canal for example in wombourne and lower penn there be plan for two battery energy storage site to be erect close to the staffordshire and worcestershire canal and the south staffordshire railway walk not only be the canal green corridor through our beautiful countryside an area of outstanding local beauty but it be close to the historical bratch lock and bratch pumping station it be popular site for canal user and angler alike the consequence of major fire and the chemical run off would be devastating for fish stock and other wildlife the planning and regulatory system must catch up with the reality before all the application be approve and in use by which time it may be too late we need the national fire chiefs council to update the guideline as well as their assessment of battery energy storage system before that be do however we clearly need minimum distance between battery site and residential property we need the fire service to be make statutory consultee on planning application for battery energy storage system furthermore the government really must go back and make the change need to the planning and infrastructure bill to ensure that local authority and community have real and meaningful say on where such system be and be not instal call the liberal democrat spokesperson draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as be an unpaid director for reach community solar farm congratulate my hon friend the member for horsham john milne on secure this important debate and on his strong and comprehensive speech support the need for regulation have be impress by all the speech from across the house as well as by the fact that every single one support the motion hope the minister have hear that and will urgently take the action require be proud of the liberal democrats consistent support for green energy and recognise the need for battery energy storage site so be deeply worried that current practice cause concern about safety anger at lack of community involvement and little or no share of the profit come back to the community affect prime example of those problem be the vast sunnica solar farm plan in my constituency stretch through into west suffolk community group and parish district and county council all oppose the development their evidence convince the planning inspector to recommend refusal but within two week of join the government the secretary of state for energy security and net zero grant permission now it be down to the local authority to decide on final detail include the battery energy storage site for up to mw the council will have work day from receive detail from the developer to consider whether they need further information to share the application with consultee to collate any request for further information and then to return the question to the developer they must do that without any clear guidance or regulation on battery safety they be advise to consult the fire service and the fire service in turn have no battery safety regulation to refer to just the guidance issue by the national fire chief it will also be difficult if not impossible for meaningful public consultation to be fit into that timetable the liberal democrats be call for local fire service and the environment agency to be statutory consultee for bess so that they can advise on make the site safe and on how to manage fire should one break out local community also need to be consult as they know well how the area be use where the water course run and what wildlife be present fortunately as we have hear bess fire be rare but where they occur they can last for several day the water use by the firefighter in the liverpool case combine with the chemical give off by the battery to create hydrofluoric acid ely and east cambridgeshire have many interconnect water course from drainage ditch through to the river great ouse as well as the internationally important wicken fen wetland site and other vital wetland site if those become contaminate with hydrofluoric acid the damage to wildlife especially in our rare chalk grassland would be enormous we be also the breadbasket of england imagine the impact on our farmer and therefore our food supply not to mention the impact on the horse racing and horse breeding industry our planning department need clear regulation and relevant statutory consultee so that they can ensure that bess be instal in the right location and have the necessary boundary run off catchment and so on to ensure that the fire risk be minimise and that in the event of fire people crop soil and nature be protect defra have state that it will consult in june on integrate bess into exist environmental regulation would be grateful if the minister could let we know when we can expect the consultation to open many bess be already operate more have permission and yet more be apply for permission proper regulation and guidance be therefore urgent the liberal democrats want green energy to replace fossil fuel green energy reduce fuel poverty give the uk fuel security and be well for the environment to be successful and reliable green energy need battery energy storage site but those storage site must be safe and that require government regulation and guidance and make local fire service and the environment agency statutory consultee call the shadow minister be pleased to close the debate on behalf of his majesty opposition and hope to give voice to your constituent madam deputy speaker give the interest in this important subject in romsey and southampton north congratulate the hon member for horsham john milne on secure the debate and make such comprehensive speech he be even wise enough to quote the fire expert from the county that matter most by which obviously mean suffolk the fact that there be such clear theme from member across the house and across the divide of the house right and leave net zero enthusiast and sceptic show that we be deal with an undeniable problem that the government have not yet grip there be clear consensus across the house from my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith to the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman that there be total absence of regulation with this risky technology there be also agreement from the hon member for south derbyshire samantha niblett to my hon friend the member for bromsgrove bradley thomas about the effect of the policy on the countryside such as on the availability of good farmland and on rural road as well as the challenge of fire service response time in the country the hon member for normanton and hemsworth jon trickett and for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone make the point that bess fire can have serious effect on our precious river also want to single out the speech by the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage who draw attention to the dodgy finance of lot of the firm behind lot of these application that be something we need to investigate far there be broad agreement on the suggestion make by my right hon friend the member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke that these battery site should not be allow to go ahead until proper system of regulation be introduce be afraid that be go to breach the cross party love in by pick up on what my hon friend the member for south northamptonshire sarah bool say about ideology the government be bet on battery energy storage system thank to their ideological aim to decarbonise the entire grid within five year therefore choose to depend on unreliable intermittent and expensive renewable that be the root cause of the dependence on the technology we be debate interruption the hon member for ipswich jack abbott can intervene if he wish it be the consequence of the zeal of the energy secretary that we be debate these subject thank to net zero policy cost which be relevant more than wholesale gas price britain already have the high energy cost in europe push policy to run fast than technology will allow risk crisis in the grid and in our economy as someone who work in the energy industry for five year before come to this place would appreciate some honesty in recognise that the application the hon gentleman have just reference have be in the pipeline for lot long than the labour government have be in power the hon member will note the enthusiasm and ideological zeal of the energy secretary which begin think in his very first week when he come to this house and announce that he be impose mass of solar farm on part of the country and in the case of the solar farm in my constituency completely disregard the independent expert examine authority that be clear difference between the two government we be discuss mass solar be inefficient and produce less power even than wind which have high load factor between and for solar between and for onshore wind and between and for offshore wind and that be wind which be unreliable in itself the comparison worsen next to nuclear as it would take million solar panel take up at least acre of often top quality farmland to produce enough power to match an average reactor to the surprise of no one the world bank say we be one of the country with the least generous condition for pv indeed we rank higher only than ireland battery and solar panel also expose we to dependence on china which produce more than of the world solar panel many be make with slave labour and perhaps all contain kill switch control by beijing while an amendment to the gb energy bill be pass to ban the government new quango from use slave make import it do not apply to private sector purchase so much for end our dependence on foreign dictatorship and human right abuser so much for our energy security giant solar fail even on its own term because it be four time more carbon intensive than wind and nuclear apart from biomass solar be the most polluting of all renewable as this debate have show there be very real safety concern about the battery site that we must address these battery site pose public safety risk that the government be simply ignore with bess site already in operation and with well over planning application in the pipeline as my hon friend the member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood note this need to be confront as matter of urgency build these site and try to deal with the safety question later be reckless expensive and dangerous when fire start at bess site highly toxic emission be release into the air they include chemical such as hydrogen fluoride heavy metal and carcinogen force people to stay indoor these fire do not need oxygen to keep burn so they can last for week they can be reignite easily and the health effect of exposure to these gas be major concern just look at the fire in liverpool four year ago which several member cite it take hour to put out in answer to my write question the government have confirm that no environmental impact assessment have be make of that incident so no lesson be be learn and this year we have see fire at battery site near rothienorman in aberdeenshire and in east tilbury in essex have repeatedly raise fire safety directly with ministers but no satisfactory answer have be give the government have make no assessment of the adequacy of fire service near battery site there be minimal oversight from the health and safety executive and the environment agency the national fire chiefs council recommend minimum distance of metre between grid scale battery and occupy building but it be only guidance and there be no statutory requirement to maintain this distance as the liverpool fire prove major blaze can affect people over much wide area anyway we need clear involvement from the fire and rescue service in the planning application process for battery site look at concern around construction fire safety and retrofitting henry griffin from suffolk fire and rescue service have describe battery site as an emerge risk say there can be complication with vapour cloud and fire will last long time fire service have no legal power to enforce safety measure on battery site we need legislation and resident need say sunnica be one of the big solar and battery farm in the country as mention by my constituency neighbour the hon member for ely and east cambridgeshire charlotte cane and it have be impose on our constituent by the energy secretary three day after enter office the energy secretary approve the application overrule the advice of examine authority and quite clearly from his answer to my question he have not read the evidence breach his quasi judicial responsibility sunnica will cover over acre of prime agricultural land across west suffolk and east cambridgeshire three battery site will be build and the whole project will actually increase carbon emission sunnica have treat resident with contempt and use consultant who specialise in questionable assessment of the quality of farmland sunnica be also locate very close to the raf basis at mildenhall and lakenheath which host the us air force and many service personnel live in the area we believe russia have already target those basis with drone recently and the director general of say that arson and sabotage be part of the russian modus operandi in european country to approve sunnica without assess this very serious danger be grossly negligent rush towards mass solar and battery farm like this be an act of ideological irresponsibility it be bad energy policy reduce our energy security while increase the cost of energy for family and business it exactly what you do order the hon member for ipswich jack abbott might like to read the handbook on how parliamentary private secretaries should behave it be not their job to be hear if he wish to contribute to debate on policy area perhaps he should resign his position and return to the back benches thank you madam deputy speaker if the hon member for ipswich be more confident in his argument he might want to stand up and take part as be say it be bad energy policy reduce our energy security while increase the cost of energy for family and business it be bad farming policy because it put some of our good agricultural land beyond use and as this debate have show it be bad for public safety because the government in their haste and zeal want to ignore the very serious danger these battery bring congratulate the hon member for horsham john milne on secure this debate and on his thoughtful and informed speech thank all member for raise this incredibly important issue let reassure they and this house that the government appreciate all the concern that have be raise there be no complacency and we be take responsible approach to the deployment of grid scale battery which be an essential part of deliver clean energy we be very clear that increase the amount of clean renewable electricity generate store and use in the uk will improve our energy security it will bring down bill for consumer in the long term by reduce our reliance on fossil fuel market which be volatile it will create job and it will tackle the climate and nature crisis which we must do for future generation we be committed to deliver clean power by and it be reassure to hear support for that ambition from member across the house with the disappointing exception of the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy who have adopt pretty impressive skill of rewrite history and forget his own government shoddy legacy on this in the clean power action plan the government outline that gw to gw of grid scale battery storage could be require by understand that many member here today be concerned that this come at the expense of health and safety but let reassure they that that be absolutely not the case acknowledge that there have be number of incident at battery site in in particular and this have raise legitimate concern we hear those concern and understand they and member be right to raise they with government however it be incredibly important for to stress and reiterate point that have be make by other member that the risk associate with grid scale battery be relatively small and well understand that there be robust measure in place for manage those risk and that government be already take further step to address some of the issue that have be raise the minister know that be as passionate about clean green energy as she be and that flexibility will be key to ensure cheap bill for customer but that be why it be vital that we give the public confidence in system like bess will she reassure that the government recognise that we must give the public confidence so that we can ramp up the energy infrastructure need to achieve the target she have outline will absolutely reassure my hon friend we understand that we must maintain public confidence and that we need robust framework in place fire service be devolve to the scottish government do not think that the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman would disagree that co ordination on this matter between the devolved administrations and the uk government so that we be sing off the same hymn sheet be crucial we recognise that there need to be co ordination but first let take the framework that be in place it be often claim that there be no regulation in this sector because there be no specific law address battery safety that be simply untrue the safety and standard of battery be assure throughout their life cycle the government be therefore confident that the safety risk pose by grid scale battery be relatively small and well manage will take each aspect of this matter in turn begin with the planning regime planning practice guidance encourage battery storage developer to engage with local fire and rescue service before submit planning application so that the issue relate to sit and location that hon member have raise be deal with before an application be make think there be scope to strengthen the process and build on it in order to address some of the issue that have be raise let come to the crux of the regulatory regime for grid scale battery the health and safety law oversee by the health and safety executive the fundamental principle of health and safety law be that those who create risk be well place to control it operator of grid scale battery site be expect to assess the specific situation and implement the necessary control measure of particular relevance be the health and safety at work etc act the dangerous substances and explosive atmospheres regulations the electricity at work regulations and the management of health and safety at work regulations together that framework put in place protection against some of the issue that have be raise but take the point that the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman raise that there be scope to think about how we bring this together in way that be accessible and enforceable and ensure that the underlie provision and protection that be bake into legislation be well understand by the sector to complement the exist health and safety framework the government will consult later this month to answer the question on the timescale on whether to include battery in the environmental permitting regulation to provide further safeguard and assurance environmental permitting will provide for the ongoing inspection of battery site give additional assurance that appropriate mitigation be maintain throughout the project life cycle critically the environmental permitting regulation make it an offence to operate regulated facility without permit or in breach of the condition of that permit we will consult on the principle and then work with industry local government and key stakeholder in order to develop the detail if we get it right that should go long way to address many of the concern that have be raise when the government do the research on mitigation that the minister talk about gently suggest that they lie down in statute the minimum mitigation facility that will be expect to be satisfied in planning application at the moment there be no statutory outline for what mitigation must be put in place inspection be great but we be not actually inspect anything from statutory point of view encourage she to ensure that the result of the research be that applicant have it lay out for they what mitigation need to be in place we will consult and work with host of party to ensure that we get this right as my hon friend the member for rushcliffe james naish say we have an interest in ensure that the public feel complete confidence as we put forward this technology and as we agree site across the country let respond to the specific point that be raise by number of hon member on the proximity to residential area it be true that there be no mandated minimum distance between bess site and occupy building but the national fire chiefs council guidance recommend distance of at least metre we can look at how we can build on that go forward the one thing that hope everyone take away be that the government understand the concern that have be raise and that members constituent be raise we believe that there be clear health and safety framework in place that we can build on and we be intent on build on it we will continue to work to strengthen the guidance and process that be in place so that we can ensure that we have the confidence of the public we believe that this be crucial part of how we get to net zero but as hon member have say we must do it in way that ensure the safety of the public that be priority for we as it be for all member of this house thank the minister for her response and all right hon and hon member for their contribution wherever we stand on renewable energy we can all agree that we must have the high possible safety standard that be an absolute give from the conversation have have with industry clear national guidance would be widely welcome because what we have now be not feel to be sufficient what industry most want be clarity so any rule can be integrate from the start at the design stage when the cost impact be minimal regulation be clearly live issue in many constituency with so many application across the country as member have say however everything be progress in random and unco ordinate way the fact that the government do not know which department should answer question on the subject be reveal be concerned that parliament do weak job of scrutiny on niche subject like this one because they be so technical we be currently place part of that responsibility on the shoulder of local councillor and council officer who can not possibly have the relevant expertise in her remark notice that the minister be still use the term encourage in relation to consult with local fire officer that be not enough as such consultation should be mandate and be disappointed not to hear that there will be mandatory consultation which be what we all want stress again that incident will be rare but single incident can bring down an industry hope that the minister will not make the same mistake that be make over clad regulation let we make this tragedy that never happen question put and agree to resolve that this house recognise the unique challenge pose by lithium ion fire in battery energy storage site and call on the government to bring forward enforceable national regulation for their design and construction petition reform of planning system rise to present petition alongside corresponding online petition sign by hundred of my constituent in north east hertfordshire demand planning system that put people and nature before profit the root cause of the housing crisis be the flawed developer lead model that fail to deliver affordable home and manufacture false conflict between housing and nature the government must put council back in the drive seat with the funding and tool to build genuinely affordable home within sustainable community the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to reform the planning and infrastructure bill so it deliver for both worker and wildlife redefine affordable housing base on local income ensure developer deliver on their housing promise protect irreplaceable habitat like chalk streams and uphold local democracy in the planning system follow be the full text of the petition the petition of resident of the united kingdom declare that the planning system should put people and nature before profit the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to reform the planning and infrastructure bill so it deliver for both worker and wildlife redefine affordable housing base on local income ensure developer deliver on their housing promise protect irreplaceable habitat like chalk streams and uphold local democracy in the planning system and the petitioner remain etc afghan relocations and assistance policy motion make and question propose that this house do now owatemi it be privilege to rise to move this adjournment debate about application to the afghan relocation and assistance policy which have come to be know as the arap scheme intend to raise deeply troubling case that highlight serious and systemic failing in the operation of arap those failing have very real and potentially fatal consequence for real human being who serve we and who be now in fear of their life importantly will ask the minister for the armed forces the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard to reconsider the whole process the individual to whom be about to refer play crucial role in save british life during our operation in afghanistan he support our troop and our mission often at immense personal risk to he and his family yet it seem that he have be abandon by we when we consider that we have give so much to afghanistan build new government new freedom and some democracy think the west run away from afghanistan be an act that sham we all deeply as be the fact that those who serve we and clearly put their life at risk have be brush aside it do not matter who be in power or which government it be say simply that that be motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now owatemi thank you for that madam deputy speaker that have give few more minute the arap scheme be introduce to provide lifesaving path to safety for afghan national who directly support the uk mission in afghanistan at its core it be moral and strategic obligation these individual risk their life work for uk force and believe the uk must duly protect they the government be right at the time to introduce the scheme and it be important to acknowledge that it have achieve something however in practice believe the scheme have fall dramatically short both morally and logistically many eligible afghans be still strand under taliban rule and fear for their life which highlight the failure in the scheme execution be grateful to the right hon member for bring forward this debate wait for more than three year to hear about the outcome must be absolute torture for those who serve in afghanistan and support we as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on afghan woman and girl be email by people wait for resettlement through arap and the afghan citizen resettlement scheme who want update that can not give they do he agree that the minister need to review the communication give to outstanding applicant to ensure that they be give update in timely manner indeed the hon lady be right in raise those point the fact be that this scheme do not fit the requirement any long and think it be in many sens quite brutal and inhumane will deal with couple of the problem here then will deal with personal case first the scheme be utterly slow and bureaucratic will say to the minister from the start that this debate be not party political it be very much about scheme that we bring in and that the government have inherit and hope that it can be change in the spirit of that remark do not wish to ambush the minister when he speak with quote from the defence secretary when he be the shadow defence secretary so may put it on the record now after major inquiry by the independent lighthouse reports and sky news in november he be quote as say it be extremely worrying to hear that afghan special force who be train and fund by the uk be be deny relocation and leave in danger these report act as painful reminder that the government failure towards afghans not only leave family in limbo in pakistan hotel but also put afghan life at serious threat from the taliban britain moral duty to assist these afghans be feel most fiercely by the uk force they serve alongside there can be no more excuse agree with those word the secretary of state for defence say previously hope he be speak to highlight problem with the government as those in opposition must do be afraid that my government do not resolve that issue at the end of my speech as the minister will know will pitch to he how thing should be different the bureaucracy of the scheme be astonishing thousand of application remain unresolved some of which be submit as far back as many of these people have have to flee and hide with their family because they risk death will come back to particular case that highlight all that the long lack of transparency and the long delay have leave these individual in personal and collective danger the scheme have narrow and inconsistent eligibility criterion individual who have serve alongside uk force have be exclude due to narrow definition and specific eligibility category that rule they out other have be deny protection because they be employ by subcontractor rather than the ministry of defence yet they carry out the same vital work and face the same risk as other who be directly employ then there be the broken promise the uk government assure those who serve with the british force that they would not be leave behind yet life be still at risk first hand report from afghanistan show that former ally be now be target by the taliban do not serve in afghanistan do serve in the british military fact of which be proud but there be some in this chamber today who do serve there and who know from first hand experience what be go on throughout all of this as lie out the individual case there be very simple theme we must stand by those who stand by we because if we do not we be not worthy of be british or of the freedom we uphold and fight for those who stand by we fight for those freedom too they support we in those fight and we can not abandon they give the threat they now face the fact that they be in hiding fearful for their life be an absolute travesty and the idea that we could have forget they should be badge of shame for any british government and for the british establishment rise order the right hon gentleman will know that he can not intervene from the front bench in an adjournment debate hope can give my right hon friend time to get to the benches behind he as he may wish to intervene on be sure that he will not be notice in that movement swift and ghost like as he be not go to stretch this out any long the individual will refer to today work alongside british force in afghanistan provide operational and intelligence support under direct threat from the taliban his family and his home be threaten he serve in the national security directorate in kabul his work involve share critical intelligence with the british special force and intelligence service in kabul and of course in the wide region that intelligence undoubtedly save life and contribute to the success of key operation his contribution be simply not in doubt or in question they be evidence extensively include in powerful testimony from the most senior commander of british force in kabul at the time who be now general he personally work with this individual and have testify to the crucial role he play be not go to name the general at this point but he say in his letter in support of this individual application his daily security briefing cover possible threat and intelligence report these report make substantive and crucially life save contribution not only to the uk military and national security objective with respect to operation in afghanistan but also to the day to day safety of british troop and civilian british embassy staff and other he also say that by the very nature of the daily intelligence that this individual be require to share within this high level forum the threat to his life and that of his family be unquestionably at an elevated risk from target attack include high risk of death or serious injury by the taliban regime would have think that that alone be powerful enough evidence to say that this individual should be here now as he be currently in fear for his life in another country nearby do serve in afghanistan include with the young major who be now the general that my right hon and gallant friend be refer to he be an outstanding officer with unimpeachable credential my right hon and gallant friend be make compelling moral case have see at first hand the risk that those afghans who support we on operation face alongside we which only increase exponentially when the taliban take over we have very moral case for do whatever we have to do to fulfil our obligation and if that mean tear up someone bureaucratic rulebook so be it it be powerful that my hon and gallant friend be here today to support this debate give his service in afghanistan he will understand more than most the threat that be receive by these people and how their life would have be more difficult he will also know that many would have lose their life have this sort of intelligence and support not be available from these brave individual be grateful for his intervention despite the overwhelming evidence present there be much of it the application be reject on all count and the individual remain at risk what we get back in the paper that look through which come first to the minister and then to be this the decision maker be unable to satisfy themselves from the evidence provide or that hold by the uk government that his role with national directorate of security be closely support or in partnership with uk government department be that really the good we can do some bureaucrat stick away somewhere who do not care who be not even in the ministry of defence and who have no real understanding of what it be like to put one life on the line for other people safety all of that evidence be dismiss in the line unable to satisfy themselves from the evidence provide find that astonishing and appalling say that not to attack civil servant many of they be brilliant and do lot of work but this process allow someone to make decision about the life and death of brave individual without even think about the consequence this be not just about bureaucratic error as say the situation be very human it be literally life and death we be make decision today under this scheme to have this individual die that be pretty much what they be say he be man in hiding in fear of his life and the life of his family understand that even his close relation have be arrest and have probably be torture to find out where he be we dismiss it with the word that those process his application be unable to satisfy themselves by the very nature of the daily intelligence that this individual be require to share there be threat to his life and to his family he have place himself between we and the taliban record of these meeting be keep and widely publicise include in public relation focus photograph show the individual at meeting attend by the general this evidence be record in afghan government system and in office now commandeer by the taliban who now know what he be do it be still easily searchable on the internet today yet the decision maker be unable to satisfy themselves from the evidence provide that he be closely support or in partnership with the uk really thank my right hon and gallant friend for give way on that point be this not case of the old adage that rule be for the guidance of wise man and the obeyance of fool be we not see punctilious following of rule here when man life be at risk indeed we be we be elect that be what make we different to this chamber to take that on and to change it we be not bind by bureaucratic process we have the power here to change anything and simply ask why not do that when human life and those who serve we be at risk we must recognise and remember that we be not bureaucrat we be politician and we must feel the pain of other and understand when we need to change be concerned that my own government do not make that change before and in way be beg the government to see it differently and to try to do something about it more and more ex military and ex security force people be be target in afghanistan we know that it be fact execution be take place all the time but because we be not there and it be not on the television every day we put it to one side we forget that dead british serviceman be clap through the town because people recognise their bravery in be out there to help people and to support those who do not want that tyranny back in their country we support those serviceman and we feel strongly for their bravery why do we not feel the same for those who help they and who help many other to stay alive surely they be just as valuable to we as any british soldier who be save by they that be the cost and that be the equation simply say to the minister that accord to the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan quarterly human right update the taliban detain at least former government official and member of the afghan national security force during this period at least five be subject to torture or other form of ill treatment many of the arrest take place in panjshir and kabul and be reportedly tie to allege link to the national resistance front as say early do not believe that this individual case be isolate it expose deep systematic failure in the arap scheme the excessive bureaucracy and eligibility criterion be remarkable the system as it stand be clearly ill equip to deal with exceptional case there be many such as this one most importantly it fail to offer the necessary protection to those who be now at risk because of their loyalty to the uk and the british force as say early know there be colleague on both side of the house who behave bravely and serve their country include the minister colleague who sit on the front bench will finish my comment with this surely we must now change the scheme we must be generous to those whose generosity with their life have keep so many british life safe know the restriction of be at the dispatch box and know that civil servant will have say to the minister be very careful you do want to step across this one and you must make pledge that we can consider do let that man put your career in danger think put our career in danger be nothing compare with the action of those who put their life in danger for we simply ask the minister to pledge that he will do his utmost that he will speak to the power that be and that he will bang on the door of no and demand that the prime minister take on this case and other personally while we build up our armed force and look to have ally and people who will work with we they will look back at how we treat those who come before and they will ask themselves why do serve with people who forget you when the deed be do say to the minister let we not forget they they be as brave and as important to we as the soldier who be directly employ by we who serve we and who make sure that many be save as result thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for raise this issue and for present his argument in the way that he do we have speak about this case on number of occasion so he will know that take responsibility for make sure that we make the correct decision on arap when be on the opposition front bench where the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois be now sit raise concern about the functioning of the arap scheme in office we have make change to the scheme to make sure that it function well which will come to the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain mention communication and believe the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis quote the secretary of state comment on the triples review but will address the issue raise by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green in the first instance very much appreciate the right hon member advocacy for the individual involve and his passion for afghan resettlement in general he be absolutely right to say that we owe an obligation to the people who serve alongside uk force what we have do with the arap scheme be implement as nation under the last government and this one probably the most generous afghan relocation scheme of any of the ally that serve in afghanistan and we have draw set of eligibility criterion that with the exception of the triples which will come to in moment have broadly remain the same under this government and the precede report july vol correction hear the right hon gentleman concern about element of that which will seek to address as former minister he will know that will not be able to address the individual circumstance of the case without permission so will make some more general remark in respect of that individual case however hope the right hon gentleman will not mind my saying that we have meet previously on this matter and very much understand and appreciate his ongoing engagement have to be honest with he and say that when he and first speak about this case and be brief on it too be surprise by the decision that be make that be why undertake to take it back to the department and to check on the eligibility of the case which do have do that be confident that the official have follow the publish criterion and apply they correctly to the evidence provide the decision be appropriate and should stand should also be clear that there be no plan to ask to expand the criterion which be implement by the previous government do however recognise the context of this particular matter and be happy to take up the right hon gentleman challenge to see whether exceptional route may be available do not want to give he false hope be not certain there will be such route but have speak to he previously about this know the seriousness of the matter he raise and be happy to see whether we could look at additional opportunity to provide support in this case when it come to the publish criterion for arap we must be absolutely clear about eligibility and it be my job as the minister responsible for afghan resettlement to make sure that decision be make correctly against the publish eligibility criterion where decision have be make an individual have access to review and where there be concern over an individual security while that review be ongoing especially circumstance in which the life and safety of that individual be threaten there be the ability to request an expedite decision the minister civil servant will be proud of he think the point my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith be make be that when the computer say no and the minister know that the computer be wrong do he not have an obligation simply to go away and change the system first put on record that we have exceptional civil servant work in this area who take the decision very seriously and make those decision in full consciousness of their consequence be absolutely convinced that we have good team work on this on the point the hon member raise we be make decision against the publish criterion and it be right to do so we know that amendment to the publish criterion change the eligibility in respect of past case we also know that at the moment we have the most generous afghan resettlement scheme we have resettle eligible person in the united kingdom under arap and the associate afghan resettlement scheme which be more than many of our ally it be right that we make those decision against the publish criterion and that we look carefully at they that be why undertake to do so in this case and have do so there be real challenge and entirely understand it as someone who have advocate for afghans in my own plymouth constituency who fall outside the publish criterion which be set in place by the last government and that we have follow have often argue that we should look again at this obligation be entirely aware that the majority of my effort on this have centre on the triples who will come on to and whether those decision be make correctly will give the house an update on that in moment want to make sure that decision be correct accord to the publish criterion those criterion be frequently challenge in the court and we have to uphold they to make sure that every decision be valid every case be assess on case by case basis base on the information provide follow request for the information hold not just by the ministry of defence but by other government departments and partner across government in order to make sure that the decision take be as appropriate as possible individual who get decision that be not in their favour also have the ability to provide additional evidence and to have that decision review know that the minister sincerely care about all of this and be sure that he really want to do his good however the key point be make by my hon and right hon and gallant friends be that if the criterion do not cater for situation in which senior british military personnel give first person testimony that somebody save british life by take exceptionally courageous step in our support the criterion need to be adjust that be what should be do as hope he be go tell we that it may have be adjust for the triples entirely understand where the right hon gentleman be go with that argument under the criterion in the scheme we inherit from the previous government which we have continue we have make the decision with the exception of the triples to keep the eligibility decision the report july vol correction let turn to the triples which the right hon gentleman raise believe that the quote of the secretary of state when in opposition be in relation to the very concern situation believe it be concern to he and to when in opposition that decision be make in respect of the afghan special force the triples that be inconsistent with the evidence that be be provide we back and call for the triples review which be initiate by my predecessor in the previous government phase of that review have now complete and we have achieve an overturn rate of around write ministerial statement on that be publish think last month should the right hon gentleman want to refer to the full detail in that work we interrogate the datum that be available the record keeping of that period be not good enough as have say from the dispatch box number of time since take office as part of that trawl we discover information in relation to top up payment which previously have be exclude from the criterion because they do not constitute the relationship with the uk government that would have create eligibility our belief be that the way those top up payment be apply may now constitute relationship that need to be re examined so phase of the triples review which will be the final phase of the review be look at top up payment it be right to do that because there be clear point in the case raise by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green be very happy to try to see what be available to support it feel very deeply that we need to honour our obligation to those people who serve alongside our force from the afghan translator and interpreter who live in the constituency represent to the people who fight and in some case die alongside our force the arap scheme be generous scheme but it be not intend at its point of initiation or now to cover all afghans who fight in that conflict over year it be design to support those who we can evidence have close connection to uk force often define by contractual or payment relationship in blunt plain english term where sizeable commitment have be make that draw line for some individual who be employ by the afghan national army the afghan government and element of the security structure that the afghan government have at that time for which eligibility be not create despite their role the taliban regime have create chaos instability and terror through many community in afghanistan since our departure that be why as government we be try to accelerate and deliver the afghan scheme the hon member for north east fife mention communication that be entirely right it be something have be raise since become minister we will introduce from the autumn new series of communication design to help people understand where their application be in the process the new performance indicator will kick in from september time roughly in the autumn and that will seek to help people to understand where they be in the process there be concern around understanding for how long case will be deal with also hope the performance indicator will have time bind target to help people be able to rate the performance of the ministry of defence certainly when the defence secretary publish his statement on the afghan resettlement scheme at the end of last year he make the case that we need to complete our obligation and bring the scheme to close and it be our objective to do so rise rise will give way to the right hon gentleman hope the hon lady do not mind we be close to run out of time understand that if may just stress that the fail be refer relate to the fact that the officer who command the garrison meet this man regularly and have he at meeting in which they discuss future operation he be trust he feed they intelligence he help support they so that they do not go into area where they should not have go the major who work with this guy also make statement about how important he be even though officially there be not some kind of that tie he to our pay structure the reality be that he serve we all ask be that the minister recognise that go away and say this be not good enough this individual need to be save very soon he may be dead we do not have much time be happy to continue the conversation with the right hon gentleman in the day ahead question put and agree to house adjourn
