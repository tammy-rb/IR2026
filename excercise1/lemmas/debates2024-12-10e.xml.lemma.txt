to the week when somebody will arrive at their store to begin shoplift again after their oftentime all too short sentence do my right hon friend agree with they that the solution to hyper prolific offending must be long sentence in certain case the length of sentence and how to deal with the problem of prolific offending will be look at specifically by the independent sentencing review panel my

keep the public safe to keep up with the current demand for prison place we need to build three mega jail year cost the taxpayer million give those fact do the minister agree that we need to invest in technology to bring reoffende rate down so that we can help those people turn their life around and crucially keep the public safe absolutely public safety be our no priority and new technology give we every advantage to do thing differently that be one of the thing that the independent sentencing review under david gauke will be look at provide quality education and training for offender be one of the most effective way of reduce reoffende weston college in weston super mare run transformational prison education programme across the south west of england which support successful rehabilitation resettlement and employment of offender on release can the minister advise what step the department be take to ensure that more offender can develop the skill they need to successfully

charity the minister have helpfully set out what the government be do about reduce reoffende which welcome be he aware though of the enormous pressure put on prisoner who be approach the end of their release give the pressure that the prison service be under that be partly because of early release itself which be release prisoner before they finish programme provide by charity or the prison but also because of the churn of prisoner be ship around the prison system because of the pressure on that system be there anything he can tell we about what the government be do to ensure that prisoner approach the end of their sentence have some stability in the prison they be serve in so that they can get support as they approach release several of the thing that have mention already be design to do exactly that and we recognise exactly what the hon gentleman say on the scheme prison and probation officer have do an outstanding job in support prisoner through that journey constituent of mine report rape and sexual offence case well over two year ago but like many victim be still wait for her case to be process by the crown court leave her pessimistic about the criminal justice system ability properly to tackle violence against woman and girl what be the ministry of justice do to tackle the backlog and support victim of vawg through the criminal justice system order that be not relevant to the question that have be ask prison capacity what step her department be take to increase prison capacity we take immediate action to prevent the collapse of the prison system by change the automatic release point for standard determinate sentence we be build new prison place and we will publish our year capacity strategy shortly which will set out exactly where and by when we will get the place that we need the previous government leave prison in crisis we will fix they for good with that capacity strategy and the independent review of sentencing welcome what this government be do to increase prison capacity but what will the secretary of state do on tough sentencing if she go to my constituency of central suffolk and north ipswich she will be meet with tough gruff east anglian accent that say what the point of build prison place if you be not go to use they be sure the hon member constituent will also recognise that even with the new supply that we be build we will still run out of prison place as the demand in the system be much great than the building plan we simply can not build our way out of this problem so to make sure that there be always prison place for the people who need to be lock up and that we never run out of prison place again we need an independent review of sentencing call the shadow secretary of state the lady chief justice have say that the court be not operate at full capacity perpetuate the record number in prison on remand await trial there could be an extra sit day if the government allow they case such as rape and sexual assault be be push into baroness carr warn the justice secretary that failure to maximise judicial capacity would actually cost the government more in costly and limited prison place yet the justice secretary fail to agree to her request why be the government let out criminal rather than hear more case be tempt to remind the shadow minister about his own government track record he ought to know that it be my predecessor his colleague the former lord chancellor who agree the allocation of sit day with the lady chief justice and that that concordat agreement be conclude during the election period when the tories be still conduct business when the right hon gentleman respond perhaps he would like to explain why the allocation be make for only sitting day what have do be increase sit day by further and increase magistrate court sentence power which be the equivalent of an additional crown court sitting day in order to start crack down on that backlog instead of increase sit hour the justice secretary define intervention in her five month in office have be to accidentally let out dangerous criminal from our prison just last week she rush to parliament to close loophole that she create for stalk for disclose private sexual image and for murder she could be sign deal with other country to get new prisoner transport agreement she could be use visa sanction with foreign country to force they to take back the foreign criminal in our prison she be not do so meanwhile criminal be be release and be reoffende already will the justice secretary commit now to end her dangerous and unnecessary early release scheme the shadow minister could at least have apologise to the country for be part of government and party that run out of prison place it be the tory party that run the system at boil hot at over capacity hate to remind he but for month before the previous election the tory party operate its own emergency release scheme which do not have any exclusion for offence connect to domestic abuse will take no lesson from he as it be this government who be clean up the mess that his party leave behind crown court backlog what step her department be take to reduce the backlog of crown court case the crown court backlog that we inherit from the conservatives be dire instead of cut the number of case wait to be hear as they promise the backlog of case explode under their watch this government be get grip of the problem we have take important first step we have fund crown court sit day this year and we have increase magistrate sentence power to free up more sitting day in the crown court to hear the most serious case but we know that there be more to do be campaign to put more police on our street but that be only part of the picture this backlog in our court mean that the entire criminal justice system be creak and justice be be delay this time last year there be backlog in my region of more than case will the minister ensure that this conservative court chaos be deal with and offender be bring to justice my hon friend be absolutely right to describe the situation as conservative court chaos indeed the full picture of the last government terrible inheritance will become clear when we publish crown court datum later this week demand on the criminal court be increase at fast rate than the action we be able to take and we must therefore go far this government understand the scale of the problem and be ready to confront it with the fundamental reform that will be necessary the minister refer to court chaos tribunal judge and court worker from my taunton and wellington constituency write to the tribunal judge say tribunal be be cancel every day as they say there be not enough judge to cover the case this be absolutely not the case and people be wait month for their benefit appeal in appal poverty and again we can not deal with the case because of this limit on sit day what will the minister do to increase sit day in taunton and somerset court we be invest in increase court capacity and in the recruitment of judge and tribunal member as the lord chancellor say we have increase the number of crown court sitting day by but it be not simply enough to increase court sitting day we have to look at fundamental reform to address the serious backlog we have inherit from the conservative government gambling relate crime support for victims what step her department be take through the criminal justice system to help support victim of gambling relate crime the government be determined to provide support for all victim of crime that include publicly consult on new revise victim code in the new year remind the hon member that the minister for gambling in the other place recently announce legally mandate levy on

gambling because of his addiction the family be now in spiral debt and the whole family unit have be destroy do the minister agree that gambling company should pay levy to help compensate family especially when child be become addict the government recently announce mandatory levy on the company directly to provide support and nhs lead service will pass his comment to the department for culture media and sport to give he an answer court case backlog what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the backlog of court case on victim of crime bear down on the outstanding caseload in the crown court and bring down waiting time be priority for the government we want to ensure that every victim have the swift access to justice that they deserve we know rape victim be wait disproportionately long time for their trial and that be why we have commit to work with the judiciary to fast track those case through the court recently truro crown court which serve my constituency of south west devon have be force to shut one day week due to recent budget cut and the judicial sitting day reduction some case have already be postpone until late include lengthy case that involve victim of violence and it be prompt those victim to consider withdraw their case give the maxim justice delay be justice deny what additional step be be take to support victim to continue with their case across devon and cornwall as the hon lady know rape be an abhorrent crime and case be usually complex that mean despite judge prioritise case involve vulnerable complainant and witness rape victim can wait disproportionately long than victim of other case for their trial to come to court remind she that the government have increase the number of court sitting date by day this year and the lord chancellor agree to increase capacity in the magistrate court so that we can get through case more quickly we be also introduce independent legal advocate in the new year to advise rape victim from report to trial which will ensure they stay in the system long feel supported and get to trial in the last five year the number of magistrate cover telford and wide shropshire fall from to in of the court session go unused at the crown court victim be wait an average of month with some sexual offence take up to three year to be deal with telford vote for change will the minister ensure that victim of crime get justice and that criminal be punish absolutely the minister with responsibility for court my hon and learn friend the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman have already outline the step that the government be take to increase sentencing in our court we will of course consider what other action we can take we know that the budgetary position that the government face be incredibly tight because of the inheritance that we receive however it be vital that we make fiscally responsible decision early release scheme what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the early release scheme the standard determinate sentence early release scheme be an emergency measure that we have to take to avert the complete collapse of the criminal justice system follow the shocking inheritance leave to we by the previous government the emergency measure be not of course the solution to the crisis that we inherit that be why we will build the prison place that we need and have launch the independent review of sentencing what concern be not the past but the future and how to protect the public will the secretary of state assure that the screening process be sufficiently robust to ensure that violent and dangerous criminal be not release into the community gently say to the right hon gentleman that the past be relevant in so far as it set the context for the crisis that we have inherit which need resolve give that we all but run out of prison place number have fall to few than in the summer it be important that we recognise that the prison system be and have be on the point of collapse that be why we have to take emergency measure we have make exclusion to the scheme that should take account of his concern it be of course important that offender be monitor and supervise effectively when they be not in prison and that be what we be try to do now tech can play big role there and have ask the independent review into sentencing to look into that call the liberal democrat spokesperson there be no specific domestic abuse offence in law so abuser hide behind conviction such as actual bodily harm be be let out early under the early release scheme that be not right so have introduce the domestic abuse aggravated offences bill to create specific set of domestic abuse aggravate offence bit like racially aggravate offence that could be exclude from early release scheme woman aid be back my bill will the secretary of state back it too the hon gentleman be right to note that under current legislation it be possible to exclude only offence rather than class of offender be sure that his bill will gain some interest across the house if any such change be to be make they would be for the future as they do not help we with the current crisis will ensure to discuss the detail of his bill with the home secretary thank the secretary of state for that answer hope to have the chance to meet she to discuss it in more detail the liberal democrats be deeply concerned about survivor who have be tell that as it stand their abuser be set to be release early one such survivor be elizabeth hudson who meet on the set of good morning britain today when launch this campaign she have write to ministers about her concern but say that she have not receive response will the secretary of state meet elizabeth and to discuss her case and how survivor can be respect and protect believe that all who have write have receive response from the ministry but will chase down that specific case the way we implement the policy mean that we be able to give the probation service time to prepare which be not available to it under the previous tory government end of custody supervise licence scheme that mean that all victim who be suppose to be notify under the victim contact scheme have be notify epilepsy sudden unexpected death what discussion she have have with the chief coroner on report sudden unexpected death in epilepsy recently meet the chief coroner we do not discuss the specific of this issue but coroner have statutory duty to investigate death that be not report to they if they suspect that the cause be unknown violent or unnatural or that the death occur in custody or other state detention the charity sudep action which be base in my oxfordshire constituency of didcot and wantage provide specialist support for bereaved family improvement to the coroner service would help to reduce trauma improve understanding of the cause of death and enable more research to aid prevention of future death will the minister press for more investment in and support for the coroner service the government recognise the impact of delay and the other issue face coroner at the moment and the impact that that be have on bereaved family and the wide system we welcome the recent justice committee report on the coroner service and look forward to work closely with the chief coroner local authority and key partner to devise and deliver wide strategy for those service prison maintenance what assessment she have make of the potential merit of insource all prison maintenance my hon friend be right to ask this question under the previous government process be already under way to put in place new contract for prison maintenance we need to make sure that those contract deliver good value for the public purse thank the minister for that response the prison maintenance contract be set to be retendere to the private sector next year prison such as walton in my home city of liverpool crumble victorian prison struggle to get the small repair undertake and there be billion worth of unreported repair within the prison system we know that privatisation lead to high cost and increase squalor so can the minister or the secretary of state call time on this fail experiment and bring prison maintenance back in house where it belong the previous government pause work on essential maintenance which have add to the problem we be now deal with my hon friend be right to say that all option need to be look at in order to ensure we get the good possible value for money for the public purse from any new contract or arrangement thank the minister very much for that response one story that have be quite prevalent in the press over the past two month have be the amount of mould growth in prison which will obviously lead to health issue will the new prison maintenance service that the minister have refer to be able to deal with that specific issue if it be not deal with it will lead to ill health among those who be in prison clearly issue such as that need to be deal with staff at his majesty prison and probation service be do their utmost to try to tackle those issue but we will redouble our effort after the hon gentleman encouragement topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility last week the national audit office release damn report on the previous government record on prison building show that their promise of prison place by the be hollow unwilling to face down opposition on their own back benches the last government dither and delay ultimately build less than third of the cell they promise as result they leave our prison overcrowded and at the point of collapse later this week will set out in my year capacity strategy realistic plan for build the prison place that we need and will ensure that our prison be never leave at the point of collapse again thank the justice secretary for that answer in common with many member of the house have hear horrific story of perpetrator breach order to which they be subject give they further opportunity to terrorise injure or in some case kill woman protect by those order may harshita brella and so many other rest in peace what action be the justice secretary take to assess and improve the effectiveness of civil order in safeguard survivor of domestic abuse my hon friend will know that this government have launch pilot of domestic abuse protection order in number of area which will bring together the strong possible protection for victim in other exist protective order into single order breach such order will be criminal offence punishable by up to five year in prison and unlike other order there will be no maximum duration call the shadow secretary of state in london there be phone theft epidemic and this time it be not the former transport secretary on the loose last year more than mobile phone be report to the police as steal in the capital alone the small number of individual responsible should be lock up for long time yet last month criminal who use motorbike to steal phone an hour be jail for just two year enough be enough so will the justice secretary commit to dramatically increase sentence for career criminal get they off our street and slash crime where be the shadow secretary of state over the past year when the theft epidemic begin again give the scale of his party general election defeat some humility be usually require perhaps even an apology to the british public before he and other can earn the right to be hear again he be right about the issue with mobile phone theft and the home office and the home secretary in particular be meet with tech company to talk about how we can break the business model of those criminal cousin marriage have absolutely no place in britain the medical evidence be overwhelming that it significantly increase the risk of birth defect and the moral case be clear in that we see hundred of exploitative marriage that ruin live frankly it should have be stamp out long time ago will the justice secretary commit to end this medieval practice which be rear its head once again in modern britain the right hon member will know that there have be recent law commission report on marriage law more generally the government be go to consult on broad reform of marriage law and we will certainly consider the issue that he have raise before set out public position many of my constituent work at hmp swinfen hall in staffordshire although the boundary change take it out of my constituency recently many of the prison officer speak to there be concerned about retention at the start of their career get into more experienced role and ensure that such experience be retain can the minister reassure about the step be take to encourage retention of experienced member of staff one of the very first action of the government be to accept the prison service pay review body independent recommendation in full deliver pay increase of for prison officer in addition we monitor exit interview datum and use it to help design intervention to improve retention one in four people of work age in the uk have criminal record for variety of reason most of these people no long pose threat to society but be still tie to their past by their criminal record and face lifetime of barrier with employer what step be the minister take to ensure that the criminal record implication of sentence do not impact on an individual disproportionately the hon member raise an important issue which be always under review but that be where we be at the moment what be the government do to ensure that offender be manage effectively in the community and how will the secretary of state

drug in the human body thank my hon friend tag technology can monitor offender effectively in the community we have tag that monitor curfew and exclusion zone tag to impose home detention in effect

additional new tag to expand the use of tech outside prison one in albanians in britain be in jail and foreign national such as jamaicans iraqis and somalis be also disproportionately likely to be criminal we need well datum to inform immigration asylum and criminal justice policy will the government publish the nationality visa and asylum status of all offender in prison if yes can we have timeline and if not can we have good reason why not we be currently use data collection and publication approach inherit from the previous conservative government probably from the hon member time as an adviser to the former home secretary and prime minister but will continue to monitor the datum that we collect and publish we be committed to ensure that we deport foreign national offender and be on track to deport more this year than be deport in the previous year we will make more progress in that respect like other hon member from south wales regularly hear from constituent with relative in

place lord timpson will be answer question tomorrow in thorough detail and the hon member might wish to attend that meeting two week ago visit currys in farnborough gate after its staff suffer yet another horrify steam attack gang of six man storm into the store destroy and steal product and terrified customer how will the sentencing review contribute towards crack down on this appalling behaviour trend the independent sentencing review will be make recommendation to ensure that our sentencing legislation and framework be fit for purpose and that we always have prison place for those who need to be lock up so that our prison create well citizen out of criminal and we can expand the use of punishment outside prison will not get ahead of what that review might recommend but it will look at all those issue in the round the smuggling of illegal drug into prison have be problem for many year the last government spend over million try to deal with the issue what plan do the current government have to try to comprehensively deal with it the hon gentleman be right drug be rife in too many of our prison and that problem have be very difficult to challenge both for the previous government and no doubt for we as well we have to crack down on the supply of drug into our prison which be why we be expand the use of no fly zone the hon gentleman will know that scanner have already be use but harden criminal be increasingly move on to use drone instead we will crack down on supply but we also need to look at demand and get more of our prisoner off drug while they be in prison the current court backlog across england be an indictment of the previous government with almost case in nottinghamshire alone rape victim be wait on average over year to have their case bring to trial if it get that far what be the department do to prioritise these case and restore faith in the criminal justice system for victim of rape and serious sexual offence my hon friend be right that justice delay be justice deny and our heart break for victim wait too long for trial to come that be why we must tackle the crown court backlog which we be do by keep open nightingale court through the recruitment of more judge as say previously we need fundamental reform and that be what we will bring about to boost public confidence in the criminal justice system can the minister confirm that the government will not resort to increase dependency on community sentence many of which be unserve as the hon gentleman will have hear say many time we have bring forward an independent sentencing review to look at the issue of sentencing in the round to ensure that we be never again in the position where we be about to run out of prison place and can not lock up those who must be lock up for reason of public protection the review will also make recommendation on how prisoner rehabilitation can help people turn their life around and more importantly cut the number of victim that would result from reoffende last month in basingstoke three woman be victim of spike while on night out that appalling crime rob individual of their autonomy put life at risk and leave woman feel unsafe victim include skylar laura and jade have highlight serious gap in the awareness of and response to spiking so welcome the government pledge to make spike specific criminal offence and to train thousand of night time economy staff will the minister update the house on how the propose measure will be implement to prevent further incident in town such as basingstoke this government be commit to bring forward specific new offence of spike we be commit to modernise the exist legislation in this session so that no other victim like skylar laura and jade suffer these abhorrent crime nearly prisoner be still incarcerate under imprisonment for public protection sentence which be abolish more than year ago many for offence not intend to be cover by such sentence will the justice secretary commit to expedite the government plan to re sentence all prisoner still stick on indefinite ipp sentence to free up limited prison capacity first the last conservative government be right to abolish the ipp sentencing regime but that have leave we with cohort within our prison system who be still serve these sentence be determined to make more progress in ensure that when safe to do so more of those individual can come out of prison but will not do so in way that compromise public protection as some of these individual pose real risk to the public will not conduct re sentencing exercise because that would have the effect of release everyone immediately but we will make progress on get more people properly rehabilitate and out of prison section of the criminal justice and public order act ban prison officer from take industrial action and limit trade union ability to protect prison officer from attack on their term and condition and wage thankfully these fundamental trade union right have be reinstate for prison officer in scotland do the secretary of state agree that it be time for section to change so that worker right be fully restore for prison officer in the rest of the

particularly devastating impact on child can she outline the option that the sentencing review might explore to effectively disrupt the criminal network and protect vulnerable young people the

include with his senior staff have not receive response on december submit name day parliamentary question for response on december but have receive only hold answer my understanding be that while

in the early eighth century after he receive letter from pope gregory the letter cite leviticus which state that sacred law forbid man to uncover the nakedness of his near kin throughout the century that follow this canon law forbid first cousin marriage remain the norm and by the century it extend to sixth cousin this year tradition of first cousin marriage be illegal be continue until when king henry viii break with rome and legalise marriage between first cousin so that he could marry catherine howard his fifth wife and cousin of his second wife anne boleyn sadly both catherine and anne end up face swift end at the block however the law pertain to first cousin marriage have be more enduring remain unchanged ever since today accord to the oxford journal of law and religion cousin marriage be practise by about of the world and be most prevalent in the middle east west asia and north africa however the practice vary enormously within country and by regional culture reach at its high over in part of rural pakistan by contrast in china and western country it be less than patrick nash visit fellow at oxford university faculty of theology and religion describe how region history of harsh condition such as resource scarce rurality proximity to conflict zone and industrial poverty play major role in develop the culture that practise first cousin marriage he argue that cousin marriage be at one time biologically beneficial for the survival of mankind when time be especially hard and inhospitable however this do not carry forward into modern living condition in our post industrial age where genetic and degenerative disease be among the most severe threat to public health that bring we to the issue today certain diaspora community have extremely high rate of first cousin marriage with rate of to among irish travellers and high rate still among the british pakistani community there be worrying trend as this rate have increase significantly from that of their grandparent age group although there have be some report of the rate fall within the last decade as young people push back against the system there remain an extraordinarily strong link have already touch on why first cousin marriage be problematic but will expand far as there be three real issue at stake health freedom and our national value the danger of consanguineous relation have be appreciate throughout history the consequence of extreme intergenerational cousin marriage within the habsburg monarchy of spain eventually lead to the demise of the house itself and the war of the spanish succession that be very well document by the century the british medical journal have publish many paper on ill health transmit to child through first cousin marriage indeed charles darwin himself publicly express concern base on his own experience of marry his first cousin with three of their child sadly die in childhood today the health risk be explicable in granular scientific detail accord to alison shaw professor of social anthropology at oxford university the child of first cousin carry approximately double the risk of inherit serious disorder than the child of unrelated people health consequence can include recessive disorder such as tay sachs cerebral palsy and cystic fibrosis which require lifelong treatment and can lead to premature death an increase susceptibility to cancer and infectious pathogen such as hepatitis birth defect include facial cleft and cardiovascular condition an increase risk of many illness include schizophrenia and alzheimer and high infant mortality moreover where the parent come from multigenerational cousin parent of their own this risk be compound and intensify with every subsequent generation the science be clear first cousin marriage should be ban on the basis of health risk alone the second issue at stake relate to freedom and particularly the freedom of woman in my work in the last parliament to ban so call virginity testing and hymenoplasty see at first hand through speak to people how reproductive mechanism be use to coerce and control woman and girl where action and freedom be heavily control woman and girl live under clan mentality often know the scientific risk of first cousin marriage but make consider social and cultural calculation strict honour code where expression of individuality can be subject to social isolation violence and even death dominate thinking notion of dishonour can also significantly hinder family stand among clan institution risk the family stand in the social hierarchy and materially affect issue such as share access to clan wealth it be vital that we ensure that freedom that have be hard fight for by woman over century be protect finally alongside the impact on woman right cousin marriage have broad societal impact joseph henrich professor of human evolutionary biology at harvard university have find that cousin marriage do not just affect individual right but reshapes society his research show that cousin marriage decline in medieval europe as individualism grow the weakening of blind family tie lead to the growth of individualism natured trust of outsider and in turn help to develop deep civic responsibility beyond clan to country allow people to break free from the chain of clan class and caste in their society anthropologist sir jack goody attribute the church ban on cousin marriage as the drive force behind the breakdown of barrier between angles saxons jutes and vikings in early english society as people be enable to marry outside their clan sectarian affiliation be gradually dissolve which pave the way for the modern nation state britain be not unique in have have immigration in recent decade from some region where first cousin marriage be prevalent and therefore there have be revival in the practice that we move away from century ago norway have already ban the practice and sweden and denmark be look to do the same much like so call virginity testing and hymenoplasty it be clear that the practice be not really conducive to modern british society as mps we be more than mere delegate but rather legislator for the mother of all parliaments our country as mps we should be more than glorify social worker seek to help constituent through the bureaucracy and the system we have role in change thing for the well too henry viii change the law on cousin marriage to suit his own personal interest and pursuit but we should act in the national interest of course we should find balance have outline the risk to health freedom especially for woman and the cohesion of our society for those risk tip the balance against personal freedom while there will be detail to work through hope right hon and hon member give the chance to take the bill forward to second reading and that government front benchers will look at the measure as vehicle for positive change in our country in the end the legislation be about more than individual marriage it be about the value and foundation of our society and our democracy as the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden state there be document health risk with first cousin marriage and agree that there be need for great awareness about that issue virginity testing and force marriage must be prevent and the freedom of woman must be protect at all time however the way to redress the issue be not to empower the state to ban adult from marry each other not least because do not think such measure would be effective or enforceable instead the matter need to be approach as health awareness issue and where woman be be force against their will to undergo marriage as cultural awareness issue in do so it be important to recognise that this be highly sensitive issue for many people in discuss it we should try to step into the shoe of those who perhaps be not from the same culture as ours to well understand why the practice continue to be so widespread an estimated to of all sub saharan african population either prefer or accept cousin marriage and it be extremely common in the middle east and south asia the reason the practice be so common be that ordinary people see family intermarriage as something that be very positive overall as something that help to build family bond and put family on more secure financial foothold however as be well document it be not without health risk for the child of those relationship some of whom will be bear out of wedlock instead of stigmatise those who be in cousin marriage or those who be inclined to be much more positive approach would be to facilitate advanced genetic test screening for prospective married couple as be the case in all arab country in the persian gulf and to run health education programme target those community where the practice be most common therefore urge the house to vote against the motion and to find more positive approach to address the issue that be cause by first cousin marriage include the health risk and the consequence of modern conflict and displacement of population around the world question put standing order no and agree to order that mr richard holden robert jenrick dan carden claire coutinho david smith neil lee anderson mr andrew snowden john lamont nick timothy katie lam and laura trott present the bill mr richard holden accordingly present the bill bill read the

disposal relief claim involve the sale of business the assessment must compare estimate for the number of claim involve the sale of business in the tax year with the number of such claim in the tax year the assessment must compare the impact under the provision of section with what impact could have be expect have the rate remain unchanged since the uk have experience low productivity rise debt level and decline public service public sector net debt be at its high since the early at of gdp per capita gdp remain low that before the pandemic in july this year the government uncover challenging fiscal and spend inheritance with billion in year pressure in the public finance the office for budget responsibility review into march spend forecast conclude that have the information that have since be share by the treasury be make available to it at the time of the march budget there would have be materially high departmental expenditure limit forecast for to this be the result of the previous government not factor in the impact of series of new challenging pressure on the public finance not take the difficult decision need to address these pressure and instead make series of commitment that they could not fund this government be commit to fix the foundation and deliver decade of national renewal to do so we must turn the page and take different approach in the autumn budget the house will have hear the chancellor set out the government first step to repair the public finance by take the tough decision need to address the billion in year pressure to avoid further damage to our public service include secure billion of saving we be also put in place significant reform to strengthen our fiscal and spending framework that will improve certainty transparency and accountability and ensure that the situation can never happen again this government be take the tough decision on tax spending and welfare that be necessary to repair the public finance and restore economic and fiscal stability those choice be not easy but they be transparent they be responsible and with such difficult position they will ensure that the government can deliver on our commitment not to increase taxis on work people the change to the main rate of capital gain tax in clause to will help to address the gap in public finance while retain the uk internationally competitive investment climate the new rate be revenue maximise in the current design of the tax system generate an additional billion over the forecast period the uk headline cgt rate will remain low than those of france germany and italy and the high rate be still low than it be between and the new rate will mostly affect people who earn income from sell financial asset the government be take the difficult but responsible decision to ask that group to pay little bit more tax in order to restore economic stability clause represent the first step in package of reform to the taxation of carry interest by increase the applicable rate of capital gain tax to for carry interest arise on or after april the reform will put the tax treatment of carry interest on fair and more stable footing for the long term while preserve the uk competitive position as global asset management hub will begin with clause to concern the capital gain tax package cgt be charge on individual annual capital gain net of loss and allowable cost less than of adult pay cgt per year there be low rate available for relief include business asset disposal relief and investor relief cgt have an annual exempt amount of for individual which keep people with low level of capital gain out of the system to repair the public finance and help raise the revenue require to increase funding for public service the government be increase the main rate of cgt the clause will increase the low main rate of cgt from to and increase the high rate from to those change affect disposable make on or after october the clause also increase the cgt rate at which business asset disposal relief and investor relief be charge in phase way from to effective from april and from to effective from april phase in the rate increase for those cgt relief demonstrate the government commitment to predictable tax system the government accept that for some entrepreneur low cgt rate will be factor into their plan for exit the business which can be once in lifetime event although it be right to increase cgt rate to raise revenue it be also fair to give business owner some time to adjust the change will raise billion per year by the end of the forecast period while ensure the uk headline cgt rate remain below those of france germany and italy turn to clause investor relief offer access to the low rate of cgt on the disposal of qualify unlisted share its objective be to provide the financial incentive for individual to invest in unlisted trading company over the long term and help company in access other form of investment the lifetime limit for investor relief be previously million compare with business asset disposable relief lifetime limit of million we feel that that disparity in lifetime limit be unfair towards entrepreneur and could encourage harmful tax planning strategy the change make by clause will reduce the lifetime limit for investor relief to match that of business asset disposal relief at million of qualifying gain per person investor relief have receive little take up since its introduction in and so the government expect that the measure will affect very small number of individual turn to clause and schedule which introduce transitional arrangement and anti forestalling rule the transitional arrangement be consistent with similar rule put in place when cgt rate be charge in year in the anti forestalling rule draw on the approach take when change be make to business asset disposal relief in transitional arrangement be need for small group of taxpayer in some specific circumstance those taxpayer will have capital gain that be ascribe to the tax year in general and not to any particular point in the year and because clause make in year change the government have legal responsibility to clarify the capital gain tax liability of those taxpayer to avoid tax those individual retrospectively the legislation put in place transitional arrangement the relevant capital gain be treat as arise in the early part of the year and be therefore subject to the previous rate schedule from april there will be no need for those arrangement to remain now turn to anti forestalling rule some taxpayer will have try to lock in the old rate by enter into various artificial arrangement and specific anti forestalling rule be need to prevent abuse the anti forestall rule target disposal enter into before october but complete after that date for the main rate change and the investor relief lifetime limit reduction they also target disposal enter into on or after october for the phase rate change apply to business asset disposal relief and investor relief the provision ensure that such people can still access the previous rate and the previous investor relief lifetime limit but only where the disposal have not be artificially structure for the purpose of secure tax advantage now turn to clause which concern cgt on carry interest gain carry interest be form of performance relate reward that be receive by small number of individual who work as fund manager and unlike other such reward carry interest can where certain condition be meet be subject to capital gain tax hon member will have hear the chancellor announce at the budget that the government will reform the way carry interest be tax ensure that that be fair and in line with the economic characteristic of the reward from april revise regime will tax all carry interest within the income tax framework with multiplier apply to the amount of qualifying carry interest that be bring into charge the government be also consult on potential new condition of access to the regime legislation to implement that revise regime will be include in future finance bill in advance of the implementation of the revise regime the government be act now to increase the rate of capital gain tax that apply to carry interest clause therefore increase the rate of capital gain tax for carry interest arise on or after april from and to and from that date the single cgt rate will apply to all relevant carry interest subject to the same condition as currently to conclude the increase to the main rate of cgt to and represent balanced and responsible approach to revenue raising which will help the government to improve the uk public finance and service while remain competitive for investment the clause phase in the rate increase for business asset disposal relief over month to mitigate impact where the previous level of relief be factor into anyone plan to exit their business in the short term that underline the government commitment to support entrepreneur and recognise the vital role that small business play in our economy in addition the move to single high rate of cgt on carry interest at demonstrate the government commitment to decisive action now while we rightly take the time to undertake technical consultation on the revised regime just before call the shadow minister remind member that in committee be madam chair or madam chairman thank you very much madam chair it be always pleasure to see you in committee and to serve under your chairmanship on behalf of the opposition rise to speak to new clause and which stand in the name of my right hon friend the shadow chancellor before do so let set the scene for clause to when announce these change in her budget the chancellor say we need to drive growth promote entrepreneurship and support wealth report october vol she say something similar to the bbc in we want britain to be the good place to start and grow business and that be why she say do have any plan to increase capital gain tax this bill correct the record labour want to increase capital gain tax so clearly it do not have any plan for britain to be the good place in which to start and grow business be it any wonder that business confidence be now at the low level we have see since the pandemic clause increase the main rate of capital gain tax from and to and respectively with schedule make consequential change to reflect that these rate be now equal to those on residential property the office for budget responsibility rat the costing on this policy as highly uncertain it say that these costing be among the most uncertain in the policy package reflect the range of potential behavioural response this government be far too quick to ask other to explain how they would pay for labour policy when they be clearly fail to explain convincingly how their own policy would pay for themselves wish to take this opportunity to highlight an issue raise with by the chartered institute of taxation first let place on record my thank to the organisation for its invaluable support it have be inform by his majesty revenue and customs that it be too late to change the format of the relevant tax return page to accommodate this in year change would therefore be very grateful if the minister could provide the following assurance to hmrc first that it will be properly equip to implement this measure secondly that the change will be publish as widely as possible and thirdly that an appropriate level of understanding will be show to taxpayer contend with these complication clause and increase the rate for gain that qualify for business asset disposal relief and investor relief from april the rate will increase to from april it will rise again to as the chartered institute of taxation have highlight because the increase to the main rate of capital gain tax be effective immediately this leave window where people sell their business can save up to in capital gain tax until april in other word the tax change in this bill do not cultivate start up britain they incentivise british business owner to sell up and sell up soon this could have be avoid along with the administrative complication that have already outline have measure in clause be implement from the start of the new financial year will the minister explain why the timing of these provision appear to be so untidy and for that matter how exactly they drive growth promote entrepreneurship and support wealth creation simply say that if hon member be not satisfied with the minister explanation encourage they to vote for new clause which would require proper assessment of the impact of this perverse incentive clause reduce the lifetime limit for investor relief from million to million while clause and schedule bring in transitional rule and anti forestalling provision on those anti forestalling provision the chartered institute of taxation note that the anti avoidance measure risk be unfairly retrospective capture those who enter into commercial contract in good faith before the budget on the ground that they do not satisfy the stringent requirement put down by the treasury to be wholly commercial will the minister tell the house why the wording be so tight widespread concern over be hit with unfairly retrospective taxation would have chilling effect on part of the economy it would exacerbate uncertainty among those who already feel that they have be blindside by this government with permission madam chair shall dwell in bit more detail on clause which for sum up the labour budget only labour could increase spending by billion year over the next five year the equivalent of furlough scheme every year and still have growth downgrade as result only labour could come up with tax rise that lose money for the exchequer it be so bizarre that it be worth repeat clause be tax rise that lose money clause increase the rate of capital gain tax apply to carry interest gain by as much as by apply single rate of in the financial year after which labour propose to take carry interest out of the capital gain tax regime altogether the treasury own red book say that the measure will not raise single penny in revenue at the same time hmrc have disclose that the implementation of the measure which impact on only individual will cost million to put it another way the government could have give every affected individual tax cut worth and the cost to the exchequer would have be no different that be total madness and it be about the only measure in the manifesto that labour have keep the obr have say that the measure rank among the most uncertain in the entire budget it be why new clause would require the chancellor to review the expect impact of the policy on key behaviour highlight by the obr will the minister explain why this one measure which impact so few people cost so million when the cost to hmrc of implement other change to capital gain tax in the budget be by the chancellor own admission these measure make britain bad place in which to start and grow business in fact the measure tell entrepreneur do start up sell up they introduce tax rise which unbelievably lose money hope hon member will agree that we need to shed more light on the true impact of the budget it be pleasure to serve under your chairship madam chair will talk mostly about new clause on capital gain tax but give the remark by the shadow minister will make few point on the broad matter and on incentive to start new business my constituency of earley and woodley in the thames valley be one of the hot destination for business investment and for new start up in the tech and pharmaceutical sector have meet number of those inspire entrepreneur to talk about their start of the business journey as be widely know when entrepreneur start passionately with project they be think not about the disposal and taxation regime at the end of their journey but about the infrastructure and the support that they will have around they that bring their idea to fruition for the tech and pharmaceutical entrepreneur in earley and woodley that be about transport infrastructure skill base and school college and university in the area that can produce the kind of graduate who will then staff their company it be about regime that be welcome to entrepreneurship and be welcome for people to live in and to prosper in for all those reason very much support our budget and the budget that bring more investment to infrastructure across the uk first welcome the measure on capital gain tax introduce in new clause let remind conservative members that it be chancellor nigel lawson who in much more dramatic measure than that propose today equalise the rate of capital gain tax with income tax in that equalisation be propose because of tax avoidance to many people listen to the debate capital gain tax will not be familiar because like their main mean of taxation will be income tax and they will not have come into contact with cgt for the purpose of understanding let illustrate what mean by tax avoidance the issue be raise with by retire consultant when be canvass in the summer in the north of my constituency when knock on his door he say what be you go to do about capital gain tax want you to ensure that this do happen any more he then proceed to illustrate the mean by which he have pay less income tax than he otherwise would have do through the capital gain tax system it be principled and honourable admission for he to make to his then parliamentary candidate on the doorstep many of we pay income tax and we be all familiar with the way that it be structure among those of we who do not receive income from payroll that is who do not work for company but have the ability to structure it as self employ or consultancy income and funnel it into business of our own creation that be channel by which many people avoid pay income tax on activity that be arguably income like that happen as say for minority of people in the uk the vast majority do not have access to that route because they earn through work for other people through company and they be on the payroll and not able to structure their own company when those company hold the arguably income revenue be dispose of that be when capital gain tax come into the picture of course the rate of capital gain tax be much low than the rate of income tax and that be where the gap come from that be illustrate by my retired constituent madam deputy speaker it be important that the tax system be efficient in raise revenue which be what our budget set out the tax system must also be principle in ensure that the tax purpose to which we have allocate certain measure raise the right taxis and be target towards the kind of activity that be mean to be tax all of we in the committee would probably agree that we should pay tax through progressive system that distinguish between different form of revenue raise activity but that allocate people fairly and proportionately to those right and relevant activity be remind of the announcement that come out during the last government regard the tax affair of the former prime minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak who pay in average tax on his million in earning that be of course possible because of the relatively low rate of capital gain tax that he be pay on the vast majority of his earning which come through capital and not through earn income again to the vast majority of people listen to the debate be sure that that be reality far outside their understanding the vast majority of people in the uk earn income through go out to work and work hard every day it be for those people the work people of this country that this budget have be make so that we can lift livelihood across the country by properly fund our public service and by close the significant in year overspend that the previous government make of billion through those measure and by ensure the financial stability of our tax system and the economic stability of our country we will start to raise living standard across the uk for those reason very much support the measure as colleague will notice the speaker chair be vacant so remind member that the chair should be address as madam chair or madam chairman call the liberal democrat spokesperson commend the government for look at capital gain tax as potential source of revenue to get public service back on their foot but we liberal democrats believe there be well way of do it right now capital gain tax be unfair for everyone most people already pay too much capital gain tax when they sell property or few share because the system do not account for inflation over the time they have own they at the same time tiny number of super wealthy individual the top able to exploit the capital gain system as effectively one giant loophole to avoid pay income tax like everyone else accord to the late hmrc statistic multimillionaire use the loophole to pay less than half the top rate of income tax on their combine billion of income instead of raise capital gain tax across the board we liberal democrats would have like to see the government properly reform cgt to make it much fair to provide comparison under the labour government proposal the main rate of capital gain tax for basic rate taxpayer be be increase from to and for high and additional rate taxpayer from to accord to the government own statistic the change will raise about billion per year by to under the liberal democrat proposal we would have separate out capital gain tax from income raise the tax free allowance provide new allowance for inflation and have three different rate of capital gain tax that would have raise billion more than twice the government proposal as colleague will hear key to our proposal be the reintroduction of indexation effectively an allowance keep people from pay tax on gain that be purely the result of inflation that would be fair for ordinary people sell family home or few share but it would also incentivise long term investment by ensure that taxpayer be not penalise due to inflation if they hold their asset for long period of time to summarise the liberal democrat proposal for reform capital gain tax would be fair and would raise twice as much the institute for fiscal studies say our proposal would move cgt in sensible direction our new clause be incredibly simple it would require the government to produce report set out the impact of the change to capital gain tax under the bill on investment and on the disposable income of people in different income bracket the objective behind the new clause be to illustrate to the government that there be fair way to reform capital gain tax and to encourage the government in the spirit of constructive opposition to look at our proposal in future year it be pleasure to serve under your chairship madam chair be grateful for the opportunity to take part in committee of the whole house on crucial bill that underpin the new government aim of fix tax system that have become less fair and less sustainable over year of conservative government we will ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share and we will increase funding for public service will not detain hon member long as we have debate the measure at length already but want to make few brief comment on the portion of the bill that relate to capital gain tax as other member have point out we need to remind ourselves of our starting point as the director of the institute for fiscal studies paul johnson say in his response to the budget it do bear repeat that the fiscal inheritance that this government face be truly dire it be in that context that the bill and the wide measure announce at the budget should be see as the ifs have set out and member have mention capital gain tax be pay by less than of the adult population about people if we break that down far around of the adult population realise gain of more than million which account for two third of capital gain tax that be people the main contributor to capital gain tax pay little bit more clause raise the headline rate of capital gain tax to for gain within the basic income band for basic rate taxpayer and to for those who pay high rate income tax those level have rise to match the unchanging residential property rate the change be welcome and perhaps not as substantial as be widely speculate in advance it be important that we look at comparator with neighbouring country those rate even after the change compare well with our european neighbour in france as the minister already say capital gain tax sit at rise to for high earner our close neighbour ireland often see as haven for entrepreneur who feel that the uk be not good place to do business charge and in germany it be charge at plus solidarity surcharge on the tax pay clause include long need reform in the treatment of carry interest and be pleased that the government be proceed carefully with this long overdue measure move we towards tax regime where carry interest be within the income tax framework these measure will believe contribute to the crucial revenue that must be raise to fix the foundation of our economy and repair our public service we need to remind ourselves of the word of george dibb the associate director of economic policy at the institute for public policy research who say of the change in the budget after at least decade of under investment there be now real hope that the government can start to fix the uk economic foundation we in the snp and the scottish government believe in progressive taxation think that be evident from the change we have make to income tax since those matter be devolve we would like more progressive influence in the change before we rather than simply claw at allowance and increase the rate nothing in clause to be design to make matter well in scotland but at least the labour party be consistent on that inheritance tax and capital gain tax be increasingly out of step with modern activity in the uk economy as the ippr point out since the household wealth in the uk have rise from three time the national income to more than seven time yet over the same timeframe wealth taxis have not rise at all as share of that income tax unearned wealth more fairly and efficiently be legitimate long term ambition in state where the economy be on life support taxpayer be leave wonder from this budget whether more tax rise be on the way after substantial lack of clarity from the chancellor who say week or so ago that the government would not come back for more tax rise or indeed more borrowing but have since refuse to echo those rather injudicious remark if she do not have the confidence to stand by her own statement it be hard to imagine the effect on business and investor confidence across the uk the chancellor should have work with economic expert such as those at the ifs to create fair and more growth friendly capital gain tax but instead she have be capture by the same old treasury dogma that have serve the uk so badly over recent decade capital gain tax raise grow amount of revenue about billion last year partly reflect the increase role of wealth accumulation in the uk but it be still less than of all tax take and although cgt be pay by about people each year two third of receipt be from just people with an average gain of million cgt rate vary significantly across asset and be almost always significantly low than income tax rate that rate differential be unfair and create undesirable distortion include to what people invest in and how long they choose to work the ifs have criticise the chancellor for choose simply to increase cgt rate with no effort to carry out what it describe as much need reform it also describe the whole design of cgt as flawed add there be step the government could and should take to make the tax fair and less harmful to economic growth and well be moreover the centre for the analysis of taxation propose further change to cgt include align capital gain tax rate with income tax rate introduce allowance to incentivise investment tax the increase in an asset value when it be inherit and implement an exit tax to prevent individual from dodge uk taxis on gain make while reside in the uk it estimate that that package would generate billion but none of those measure be in the bill the ifs say that if the chancellor choose to raise cgt rate while leave the flawed tax base unchanged she would be choose to raise some limited revenue at the expense of weaken saving and investment incentive and of far distort which asset people buy and how long they hold on to they the ifs say that that would not be the decision of chancellor who be serious about growth well what portent that turn out to be she do not reform cgt and look what happen to growth forecast be down immediately after first contact with this inverse midas touch chancellor it be clear that in prepare for the budget she could have do with full hour or more with the ifs but doubt that she would have listen we come to the final back bench contribution and have save the good until last call bobby dean before address capital gain tax directly will make few short remark about the state of the national conversation about tax more generally which think be highly relevant note that tax be always something to be hit by in politic it be violent we be hammer by it so the debate end up focus on who be deserve or undeserving of such punishment as result few organisation be view as legitimate target for taxation very rarely do we in politic have the bravery to talk about the virtue of pay tax what it pay for how it benefit we all and why collectively contribute to school hospital and physical infrastructure be sensible investment that we should be proud to make that be where the political conversation fall slightly out of step with the mood of the public believe it or not have have conversation about tax on the doorstep and mostly meet people who be proud to make that contribution let be clear this be not some special plea to talk about tax in warm fuzzy way in order to improve the civility of public discourse nor should it be confuse for advocacy of high tax base economy raise that point because our distorted public conversation mean that we end up with dysfunctional tax system that be neither efficient nor equitable where we be with capital gain tax be good example of that decade of wrangle over whether capital gain tax stifle entrepreneurship or be merely ruse for the rich often result in pretty reductive focus on rate it seem that that happen again in the budget and fear that we have miss an opportunity to make that tax well as other have explain in put capital gain tax into context it be pay by around people and raise around of total tax revenue and people account for two third of that revenue that tax do not necessarily affect broad section of society but it do play an important role in investment in the economy and in the overall sense of fairness in our system let start with the economy it make no sense to for the government to make change to capital gain tax without sort out the tax base if we do not index capital gain for inflation we be not really tax the thing that we say we be tax we should be focus on the real gain otherwise we risk tax those who simply hold on to an asset for long time and ultimately we end up discourage long term investment secondly we ought to be target capital gain tax at those make the large gain if large gain be to be have those investment will be make anyway small gain however the stuff at the margin be where investment decision could be at risk raise the cgt allowance bit would go long way towards address that as would design well target relief that more precisely encourage investment finally we come to capital gain tax rate whose alignment with income tax rate be often call for the government have of course move bit on that but focus on rate alone mean that an inherent unfairness remain there would still be the sense that there be one rule for small business and another for the giant when he appear before the treasury committee paul johnson of the ifs remark on another unfairness someone can simply leave the country for few year and dispose of an asset overseas somewhere like monaco and they be then no long responsible for capital gain tax that be another inherent unfairness ultimately with the propose change only the system will continue to disproportionately benefit the very wealthy it be for that reason that can not support the measure if it pass hope the government will consider carefully the impact of the change in isolation and whether further reform be necessary in future our tax system need to ensure that everybody pay their fair share and do not think the government have quite get this one right yet we come to the front bench wind up do the shadow minister wish to speak indicate dissent call the minister thank hon member for their contribution to today debate will take few moment to respond to some of the point and will then give the government view on the propose amendment if there be question that do not answer will write to hon member thank my hon friend the member for dartford jim dickson for his important speech and agree with his point about much need reform to our tax system also thank my hon friend the member for earley and woodley yuan yang for her powerful speech and wholeheartedly agree with her constituent who seem very principled and knowledgeable to respond to the point make by the conservative spokesperson the hon member for grantham and bourne gareth davies about the revenue impact of the carry interest measure the obr certify costing demonstrate that this measure raise revenue over the scorecard period the budget do deliver on the government manifesto commitment on tax estimate revenue for these policy have be adjust for final policy decision and to account for underlie change in the obr forecast but overall the hon gentleman may be interested to know that the tax measure raise over billion more than be in the manifesto to answer the hon gentleman question about why the change be be make in year the in year rate change be make to protect exchequer revenue from the impact of forestalling it be common practice for tax change to take effect from the date of the budget as for anti forestalling we would not expect the anti forestalling provision to apply to an ordinary commercial sale of an asset where the contract be enter into prior to october those provision target those who enter into artificial arrangement to lock in the pre budget tax treatment the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for st albans daisy cooper talk about inflation indexation of cgt indexation previously exist when cgt rate be charge at income tax level with top rate of rate schedule of and be significantly below those level so for the important reason of simplicity indexation be not part of the system new clause would require the government to present to parliament review of the capital gain tax package impact on long term investment disposable income across the distribution and tax revenue in decide on these change to capital gain tax the government have already consider all three factor on long term investment the obr assess the cgt package to have no measure specific macroeconomic impact on impact across income distributional analysis for all budget measure combine be set out in the impact on household publication the government do not normally publish the impact of individual measure finally the government projection of the revenue raise by these cgt change have be certify by the obr and publish in the budget document every year the government publish the amount of cgt pay in the most recent tax year with available datum where table break down gain by income for those reason the propose report be unnecessary and implore member to reject the new clause new clause would require the government to publish review within three month of the passing of this legislation cover various issue in connection with our reform to the tax treatment of carry interest as set out early the cgt rate applicable to carry interest will increase to from april this be first step in advance of move to revise regime fully within the income tax framework from april the government believe that their reform will deliver increase fairness and place the tax rule on more sustainable footing while preserve our country position as global fund management hub we will also be undertake extensive technical consultation ahead of legislate for the revise regime in future finance bill which the house will of course have the opportunity to scrutinise we therefore do not consider that new clause be necessary addition to the bill that be before we today be very grateful to the minister for explain all the thing she have just set out but do not quite get an answer to the specific question of why it cost hmrc million to execute this tax rise which will not raise any money in the next year or the year after could she explain why this specific measure that only affect people cost hmrc million but other tax increase cost hundred of thousand of pound if the shadow minister look carefully at the document we have publish he will find all his answer write out very clearly there new clause would require the government to publish an impact assessment of the change to business asset disposal relief and to compare the impact of those change with the number of claim that would have be expect if the rate have not be change every year the government publish capital gain tax statistic which include the number of business asset disposal relief claim for the most recent tax year with available datum the number of claim in compare with upcoming tax year will therefore become public information in time meanwhile the fiscal impact of the change be be out in the tax information and impact note for this measure which have be publish online it would not be practical for the government to publish counterfactual comparison for all tax change and do so for business asset disposal relief would create an unsustainable precedent the government recognise that monitoring and evaluation be critical to maintain the efficacy of any tax measure they introduce and will continue they as appropriate for these reason new clause be not necessary addition to the bill and ask members to reject it hope have be able to reassure member who have table new clause that for the reason have set out those addition and change be not necessary therefore urge the committee to reject new clause and and commend clause to and schedule and to the committee question put and agree to clause accordingly order to stand part of the bill schedule agree to clause to order to stand part of the bill schedule agree to clause order to stand part of the bill new clause business asset disposal relief review of increase in rate the chancellor of the exchequer must commission and publish an assessment of the expect impact of the provision of section on the number of business asset disposal relief claim involve the sale of business the assessment must compare estimate for the number of claim involve the sale of business in the tax year with the number of such claim in the tax year the assessment must compare the impact under the provision of section with what impact could have be expect have the rate remain davy bring up

nadia whittome david williams steve witherden sean woodcock rosie wrighting yuan yang mohammad yasin steve yemm daniel zeichner anna turley christian wakeford the committee divide ayes noes question accordingly negative clause increase in rate of energy oil and gas profit levy question propose that the clause stand part of the bill with this it will be convenient to consider the following clause to stand part schedule new clause report on fiscal effect relief for investment expenditure the chancellor of the exchequer must within six month of the passing of this act lie before parliament report set out the impact of the measure contain in clause of this act on tax revenue this new clause would require the government to produce report set out the fiscal impact of the bill change to the energy profits levy investment expenditure relief new clause change to energy oil and gas profit levy review the chancellor of the exchequer must within three month of this act come into force publish review of the expect impact of the measure in section to on employment in the uk oil and gas industry capital expenditure in the uk oil and gas industry uk oil and gas production uk oil and gas demand and the scottish economy and economic growth in scotland at the budget in october the chancellor set out the decision that we be take to restore economic stability put the public finance on firm footing and embed fiscal responsibility in the work of government have wipe the slate clean of the mess we inherit our government can now focus on boost the public and private investment that be essential for sustainable long term growth it be through sustainable economic growth across the uk that we will create wealth and provide security make people across the country well off that goal of raise living standard in every part of the uk so that work people have more money in their pocket be at the heart of the government plan for change that the prime minister set out last week that plan also set out the government commitment to secure home grow energy and to protect bill payer by put we on track to secure at least clean power by make the transition to home grow energy have require we to take immediate action to unblock investment include decide to reverse the de facto ban on onshore wind the government have their part to play alongside the private sector in make sure that investment happen on the scale and at the pace that we need that be why the clause that we be debate be so important they be key mechanism for raise the funding that be need for that investment to be deliver we be take responsible approach that recognise the role of business and their employee in the energy industry of today and tomorrow since we form government my colleague and have be work closely with the sector affect by the energy profit levy to make sure that the transition be manage in way that support job in exist and future industry our approach recognise that oil and gas will have role to play in the energy mix for many year to come during the transition and it balance that with ensure that oil and gas help to raise the revenue that we need to drive investment towards the energy transition our legislation deliver that approach and welcome the chance to set out the detail of how it do so the clause that we be debate concern the energy profit levy temporary additional tax on profit from oil and gas exploration and production in the uk and on the uk continental shelf the levy be introduce by the previous government in response to the extraordinary profit be make by oil and gas company and it be fair to say in response to substantial political pressure from labour members do the minister believe that oil and gas company be still make extraordinary profit believe that it be fair that the oil and gas industry make reasonable contribution to the energy transition we need to ensure that during the transition from oil and gas which will play key role in our energy mix for year to come the industry contribute to the new clean energy of the future the way to have responsible manage transition be to work with the industry and make sure that it make fair contribution but to not shy away from make that transition at the scale and pace need let try to understand the minister logic first he recognise that we will need oil and gas secondly he be go to tax oil and gas company thirdly he be tell they that his government be create an environment in which there be no future for oil and gas but he still expect they to invest where be the logic be glad that the right hon gentleman have give chance to set out why the government plan be the right and balanced approach we be ensure that the oil and gas sector be support in make the contribution that we know it will to our energy mix for many year to come while ask it to contribute to the transition to clean energy the oil and gas industry recognise that transition to clean energy be under way it want to support investment and job in the industry but also to contribute to the transition take fair and balanced approach be the right way to protect the job and industry of today and tomorrow and crucially to protect bill payer give they permanently low bill and great energy independence interruption in the last financial year the oil and gas industry make billion in profit despite the chuntering from opposition members do my hon friend agree that the conservatives introduce the energy levy we be simply ensure that our oil and gas sector pay an equivalent sum so that we can transition to green energy future this money be necessary for that transition to occur my hon friend be absolutely right that we be ask oil and gas company to make fair and reasonable contribution towards our transition to clean energy that transition be under way and it be important for oil and gas company to make contribution but that should happen in way that protect the job and industry of today and tomorrow the oil and gas giant be make eye water profit when the conservative government finally introduce levy although it have loophole that let the oil and gas company off the hook the government should support the liberal democrat amendment which demonstrate how much of miss opportunity that be and how much money we could have raise have the loophole be close early be not entirely clear that that be what the liberal democrat amendment do we have be clear that our intention be to end unjustifiably generous allowance that be exactly what we be do by abolish the core investment allowance which be unique to oil and gas taxation and be not available to any other sector in the economy new research publish in the last few day have find that fossil fuel company report profit of nearly trillion during the energy crisis by contrast people struggle with fuel poverty and have to choose between heating and eat one in seven household in my constituency be in fuel poverty do the minister agree that the ability to extend and increase the energy profit levy be key lever for address this imbalance and support household order that be neatly do but intervention have to be very closely related to what we be debate here and now hope that my hon friend constituent will benefit from low bill as result of the investment that we be ensure by the public and private sector in the clean energy source of the future we know when the conservatives introduce the energy profit levy that the extraordinary oil and gas profit be drive by global circumstance include resurgent demand after and the russian invasion of ukraine household in the uk however be particularly badly hit by high oil and gas price as the government at the time have fail to invest adequately in energy independence or in measure such as home insulation when the energy profit levy be introduce an investment allowance be also introduce and this be later reduce to when the levy rate increase from to in january an decarbonisation investment allowance be later put in place for decarbonisation expenditure which be money spend on the reduction of emission from the production of oil and gas the levy be initially set at but the previous government increase it to and extend it beyond first to and later to as mention the government recognise the continue role for oil and gas in the uk energy mix during the energy transition we be commit to manage the transition in way that support job in exist and future industry recognise that our offshore worker have the vital skill to unlock the clean industry of the future put on record my thank to the offshore worker meet in aberdeen in august for give some of their time and their view when be there for meeting with offshore energies uk and representative of the sector as mention it be essential that we drive both public and private investment in the transition to clean energy clause therefore increase the energy profit levy by three percentage point from to november the clause also set out the rule for apportion profit for accounting period that straddle the start date as have make clear the money raise by these change will help to support the transition to clean energy enhance our energy security and provide sustainable job for the future clause concern allowance in the levy the clause remove the core investment allowance for general expenditure incur on or after november as mention to the hon member for bath wera hobhouse the government have be clear about our intention to end unjustifiably generous allowance and that be exactly what we be do by abolish the core investment allowance we be bring the level of relief for investment in the sector broadly in line with the level of capital allowance available to other company operate across the rest of the economy through full expensing which we have commit to maintain the energy profit levy decarbonisation allowance will be retain to support the sector in reduce emission qualifying expenditure include money spend on electrification of production or on reduce venting and flaring the retention of the decarbonisation allowance reflect the government commitment to facilitate clean home grow energy however in the light of the increase to the levy clause also reduce the rate of the decarbonisation allowance to in order to maintain the same cash value of the tax relief per of investment clause extend the sunset of the levy by one year from march to march to provide the oil and gas industry with long term certainty and confidence in the fiscal regime we be retain the levy price floor the energy security investment mechanism certainty be only good if it relate to positive outlook not negative outlook the hon member for gordon and buchan harriet cross ask clear question about the duration it be not about whether the sector pay fair taxis we all believe that people should pay fair taxis do the minister still believe that the industry be make extraordinary profit would like to explain to the hon gentleman how the energy security investment mechanism work because that to be fair be put in place by the previous government and we be maintain it it say that if price drop below certain threshold for six month the energy profit levy cease early that give some certainty and predictability to the oil and gas sector if price go below that level the sector can have confidence that the energy security investment mechanism will end the levy early if that do not happen the levy will continue as we have say until march be keen will set out few more detail later to engage with the oil and gas sector on the regime post the energy profit levy because it be important for oil and gas company make decision about investment to have certainty about what will happen up until march and to understand what the regime might be like thereafter that be why be look forward to my conversation with the sector on what the post energy profit levy regime will look like long term certainty and confidence be be provide to the oil and gas sector by our retention of the levy price floor the energy security investment mechanism which be explain to the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan it mean that the levy will cease permanently if oil and gas price fall below set level for sustained period furthermore as also just say to provide stability for the long term the government will publish consultation in early on how the tax regime will respond to price shock once the energy profit levy come to an end that will give oil and gas producer and their investor predictability and certainty on the future of the fiscal regime which will support their ability to continue invest while also ensure that the nation receive fair return at time of exceptional crisis finally clause and schedule relate to the decommissioning of oil and gas asset that be repurpose for use in carbon storage installation and pipeline carbon capture usage and storage or ccus be likely to play an essential role in meet our net zero target the uk estimate billion tonne of storage capacity present an opportunity for we to become global leader in the provision of service and storage the potential to make use of asset from the uk oil and gas sector be an opportunity that will present cost saving and quick delivery time for certain ccus project it be right that the oil and gas owner of an asset be repurpose for ccus pay for the ultimate decommissioning of that asset that approach ensure that fund be available to return the asset environment to its natural state at the end of its use in ccus in such case the energy act require the oil and gas company to pay an amount equal to the cost of decommissioning into decommissioning fund to make provision for the repurpose asset decommissioning liability when the ccus project come to an end the oil and gas company would be entitle to tax relief on the decommissioning expenditure if it decommission the asset itself rather than sell it to be repurpose yet there be currently no such relief for any payment make into decommissioning fund and that disincentivise the repurposing of asset for ccus in order to ensure that the tax be not blocker to the repurposing of oil and gas asset the change make by clause and schedule will bring the tax treatment of payment into decommissioning fund for repurposed asset into line with the tax relief available when oil and gas company decommission asset at the end of their production life this will accelerate delivery time and reduce cost for ccus project while ensure that the oil and gas company that support the transition by repurposing be not disadvantaged the cost of decommissioning be not an allowable expense with the energy profit levy so to reflect that payment receive for these asset will not be subject to the levy to conclude the government be commit to protect billpayer by secure our future home grow energy supply our plan will put we on track to deliver at least clean power by and help accelerate the uk to net zero take together the change make in clause to will raise an additional billion over the scorecard period that funding be crucial for the investment need in our future energy supply and to support our effort to deliver world class ccus industry in the uk they represent crucial investment in the future of our country commend the clause to the committee call the shadow minister rise to speak on behalf of the official opposition on new clause which stand in the name of the shadow chancellor my right hon friend the member for central devon mel stride clause to concern the taxation of the oil and gas industry which meet of the uk household and industrial energy need with of that need be meet by the north sea the sector support more than high skilled job in this country and that talent along with the rest of the supply chain will be crucial to our domestic energy transition these reality underscore the imperative of smooth and efficient transition and fiscal regime that facilitate that not least because the timeline for investment in the oil and gas industry be so long if the fiscal regime be not calibrate correctly the damage may be irreversible and the cost will be significant to recap the measure in the bill clause increase the rate of the energy profit levy from to bring the headline tax rate on the sector up to clause remove the investment allowance and reduce the rate of the decarbonisation investment allowance to so that the cash value of that allowance remain the same clause extend the energy profit levy to at which point the government be commit to implement successor regime to respond to price shock once the levy expire clause and schedule legislate for certain payment into decommissioning fund to be treat as decommission expenditure so that they can attract tax relief the question that many be ask be this do these measure add up to fiscal regime that facilitate smooth and efficient energy transition not accord to the office for budget responsibility which conclude that on average over the forecast period capital expenditure will be low oil production low and gas production low compare with our march forecast those be dramatic movement the university of aberdeen have warn rise in the epl and loss of investment and capital allowance may have the unintended effect of accelerate decommissioning and decelerate the energy transition as company face an additional cost burden the government have thankfully carry out partial turn retain the decarbonisation allowance and the first year allowance introduce by the conservative party but if they be persuade of the importance of those investment allowance and that remove they would do more harm than good why persist with remove the main investment allowance what be it about that relief compare with the other that make they want to scrap it the government talk about close loophole we see how well that go with carry interest but these measure will contribute just of the new revenue raise by the budget across this parliament do the minister really think it be worth jeopardise some of our domestic gas supply for that the measure in the budget essentially throw massive spanner in the work for oil and gas and it be unclear exactly what the government rationale be for do that when we bring in the levy it be to tax extraordinary profit in extraordinary time the revenue that we raise contribute to our effort through policy such as the energy price guarantee and the energy bill support scheme to reduce energy bill for the british people today as those extraordinary circumstance subside labour be ratchet up the levy that send mixed message to the industry ahead of the consultation on successor regime the term of that regime will supposedly be set by the need to respond to price shock yet the government justification for these measure have nothing to do with price shock instead they be all dress up in language about the sector make fair contribution as the minister say to the energy secretary environmental ideological ambition what be the government vision for the taxation of oil and gas in this united kingdom temporary windfall taxis or permanent climate levy the bill suggest the latter would be grateful for the minister specifically comment on that when he respond one way in which the minister could give an indication and provide some long term certainty would be to confirm far the future of the energy security investment mechanism which he mention as he kindly say we introduce the esim so that when price return to normal level the energy profit levy would end no more windfall profit would mean no more windfall tax will he confirm that the esim will remain in place up to think he say so at the dispatch box but would be grateful for his reconfirm its end date will he go far and confirm that it will remain in the same condition as today will the price floor continue to be consumer price index adjust the treasury and the minister have say that the esim will be retain but the industry would like further confirmation as have set out will he also write to with the treasury late modelling of future oil and gas price to prove that the expect revenue be not at the expense of the esim that modelling will be important for we to understand and get that reassurance and certainty on the esim have be in the treasury know that that modelling be continually review and produce would be grateful if he would write to with that these be not purely academic question our concern be for the hundred of thousand of people employ by the uk oil and gas industry for the uk energy security and for the efficient and smooth energy transition that we all care about the government should be not ideological but empirical in their approach which be why we have table new clause which would require review of the impact of these measure on employment investment production demand and the whole scottish economy if the government have already make detailed assessment on those specific area we would be grateful for the minister publish they on every measure the budget have not survive contact with reality growth have be downgrade real income depress and business investment reduce with broken promise and credibility completely shatter it be not so much that the labour government take different view on economic matter it be that they take the wrong view labour be the party of the tax rise that lose money we be the party of the tax cut that raise revenue that be why labour government always leave office with more unemployment large debt and high taxis they always run out of other people money and this government be set to do so in record time call the liberal democrat spokesperson once again at the heart of the debate be stark injustice understand by every man woman and child on the street of great britain in the last few year oil and gas giant have make eye water profit in many case they be profit that they do not expect to make and they have make they off the back of putin brutal invasion of ukraine and global supply chain issue that cause energy price to soar at the same time people have see their living standard drop and their energy price soar in too many case people have have to choose between heating and eat we liberal democrats be the first party to call for tax on oil and gas windfall profit back in october but it be not until may that the previous government eventually introduce the energy profit levy it be half hearted and woefully late if it have be bring in when we have call for it there would have be additional revenue to reduce people energy bill and launch an emergency home insulation scheme reduce energy consumption which would have be good for the climate and reduce people bill which would have be good for their pocket the previous government effectively let oil and gas giant off the hook by initially set the energy price levy at just and put in place massive loophole in the form of the investment allowance that allow the oil and gas giant to get away with vast sum at taxpayer expense with the excuse of investment that they would have make anyway in essence the conservatives give they tax relief on pollute activity when they should have be do everything to raise fund to reduce people bill and urgently insulate home thank to the investment allowance the big loophole in shell admit that it have pay zero windfall tax despite make the large global profit in its year history profit of billion as some colleague in the committee have refer to energy price have come down since those record level of but the oil and gas producer have still see huge profit in shell see its profit come down from billion but it still make billion how much of that profit be make in the uk versus globally to be honest do not know what the distinction be between global profit and uk profit the point be that the levy be put on uk profit make out of uk operation hope that the hon lady will agree that when her constituent can not afford to put their heating on she should not miss the opportunity to raise taxis from the big oil and gas company as say shell make profit of billion in and bp see profit of billion its second high in decade hope the committee agree that where those profit be make on uk operation they should pay their fair share we be glad that the current government have listen to call from liberal democrats and other and finally scrap the unfair investment allowance loophole but we would like the minister to give the committee some clarity on how much money will be raise particularly through the abolition of the carve out by extension we would be able to see how much money could have be raise under the previous government but be gifted to the large gas giant interruption conservative members may not like it but their constituent be choose between heating and eat people should know just how much money could have be raise and how much will now be raise through this measure would like to press the minister on the specific change to the epl legislate for in the bill understand that the headline rate of be select to match that in norway but wonder whether the government have consider go any far and look for example at headline rate of be there cost benefit analysis some of the big oil and gas producer in the world may well be able to afford to pay little more and the additional tax revenue would be big help for our public service it could have help avert the cut to the winter fuel payment will the minister confirm that the government intend to publish treasury analysis on how much revenue could be raise from each increase in the headline rate of the windfall tax our constituent understand the stark injustice that the amendment will address hope the minister will accept it be transparent and show just how much money it will raise to help put public service back on their foot will speak to clause to briefly but mainly to new clause in the name of my right hon friend the member for central devon mel stride it would require the chancellor to publish within three month review of the expect change introduce by the bill on employment capital expenditure production demand and the economy it be inherently sensible and consider the importance of the oil and gas sector to regional and national employment and economic growth in the uk on the need to review the impact on employment of direct job in the oil and gas sector be locate in scotland my gordon and buchan constituency be at the heart of that new clause would review the impact of the change to employment across the country as it be not just direct job that be on the line but supply chain and other indirect job of those be in scotland and be across the uk the hon member highlight the economic consequence of this head south on job in scotland be she surprised and disappointed as be that not single scottish labour mp have turn up to take part in this vital debate we be say moment ago how extraordinary it be that they be not here to stand up for their main industry that show how much they value or care about job across scotland we be see warning sign already of the impact of these measure just week after the budget apache confirm that it would cease operation in the north sea say the onerous financial impact of the epl combine with the substantial investment that will be necessary to comply with regulatory requirement make production of hydrocarbon beyond uneconomic accord to the aberdeen and grampian chamber of commerce job may be at risk across the uk because of the change offshore energies uk say that job directly relate to project that may not now go ahead be at risk new clause which would allow the government the opportunity to assess and account for the impact of the bill change on job relate to the oil and gas sector the supply chain and the wide economy should be welcome across the committee on the impact that increase tax on the industry will have on job be my hon friend as disappoint as be to hear the liberal democrats talk only about how much cash can be raise from an industry without ask how many job would be affect across scotland and the uk or about the impact on the economy as whole absolutely sometimes there be complete disconnect in this place between how much we can tax and squeeze something dry and what that do to investment these company especially the global one do not have to invest in the uk they can invest across the world they be choose to invest here at the moment and therefore we get job opportunity and employment that investment can go abroad and if it do it will take job with it to the detriment of all of we but particularly we in north east scotland do the hon lady not recognise that we be in transition period which we need in order to get to net zero of course we need to protect job but the transition to net zero be essential recognise that which be why it be so important that we protect the job and the investment the company in our supply chain have the skill and expertise that will drive the transition as will the investment that come in and that be why we need to keep they the hon lady make good point about the mobility of investment in the oil and gas industry be it not ironic that since we will need oil and gas if we tax company on production in the united kingdom they will simply produce elsewhere other government will get the revenue from the tax on that production and we will pay more for import exactly there must be balance between production and demand will come to demand later there be no point reduce our domestic production while our demand stay the same because we will only fill the gap with oil and gas from abroad which be produce with high carbon intensity in poor working environment where overseas job and investment will take precedence over investment at home it make no sense that while we be use oil and gas the minister himself confirm that we will be for while we do not prioritise take it from our own north sea domestic basin new clause also ask for review on capital expenditure and investment in the uk in scotland alone oil and gas contribute billion of gross standard volume in the uk it contribute billion report by experian show that for every million of investment by the oil and gas industry job and million of gva be add this industry be blatantly net benefit to the uk and the exchequer and one in which we should encourage investment and capital expenditure not an environment where the return do not justify the risk of investment as my hon friend the member for grantham and bourne gareth davies say the obr own figure show that capital expenditure will fall by and therefore production of oil by and gas by because of these change we must ask can the uk afford this maybe those be the parameter that the exchequer and the treasury be look for if they see they as allowable but if that be the case what assessment have be make of the impact on the economy and job across the uk the oeuk have put the project drop in production down to rapid decline due to underinvestment over the decade under new clause we can assess the impact of the change to the epl and head this off to begin with because as say it be important that while we have demand we have production it have be confirm that we will need oil and gas in the uk for year to come but through the change to the epl in the bill in particular clause and which increase the epl by and remove the investment allowance the government be choose to make our homegrown domestic energy sector so uncompetitive that current investment fall away and future investment be no long on the card we can not afford to lose investment because as say it will drive the transition it be so important that it be protect now to help we bring the transition forward quickly and efficiently into the future clause to be introduce without adequate consultation on the impact assessment new clause simply ask for proper scrutiny of their impact if the government be confident in their approach why resist responsible request for transparency my gordon and buchan constituent and people in scotland work in the oil and gas sector and across the uk deserve to understand how these change will impact their livelihood before call dave doogan remind member that if they wish to speak they need to be bob consistently can not read people mind to put together speaking list the change to the epl particularly those set out in clause and will have hugely damaging effect on job and the scottish economy this be also an inauspicious day for scotland in this so call united kingdom as norway sovereign wealth fund record trillion breakthrough while scotland oil wealth have be squander by successive westminster governments norway get financial security in perpetuity scotland get labour bedroom tax cut to winter fuel payment for our elderly and the high energy price in the that be the union dividend wrap up and serve on plate right there more than billion have flow from our water to the treasury over the year with very little come back in the other direction rather than reverse the train the labour government have with this increase to the epl choose to accelerate it the cumulative effect of clause to will sound the death knell for scotland hydrocarbon production in advance crucially of the transition economically illiterate fiscally incompetent and with industrial suicide as the result windfall tax be suppose to be tax on extraordinary profit yet the extraordinarily high global oil and gas price that precede the introduction of the tax have long since abate through these change the labour party jeopardise investment in scotland offshore energy and risk the future of our skilled workforce and our ability to hit net zero while employ those worker analysis from offshore energies uk show that the increase and extension of the epl risk cost the economy billion and put job at risk the analysis from oeuk also show collapse in viable capital investment offshore under these change from billion to billion in the period it be increasingly apparent that the government do not really understand how investment horizon work offshore they be not on month to month basis they take year to work up this loss of economic value impact on not only the core sector but domestic supply chain company many of whom exist in my constituency which have an essential role to play in the just transition the labour party promise that there would be no cliff edge yet it have concoct one for the worker whose job this epl change put at risk labour have claim that these change would keep the uk in line with norway but the regime after labour change can not be compare to that of norway which allow company maximum of relief per expenditure in the uk this relief would be after these past couple of week be give to wonder if those on the treasury front bench can actually count change to the epl will hinder the just transition the government argue that the reduction in the rate of the decarbonisation investment allowance to will maintain the overall cumulative value of relief for investment expenditure follow the rate increase reflect the fact that this relief will increase in value against high levy rate however the policy still reflect political choice by labour to deprioritise investment in decarbonisation rather than allow more valuable decarbonisation relief as the solitary positive by product of its tax hike labour have strive to ensure that there be absolutely no silver lining to this fiscal attack cloud on scotland energy industry at the heart of this when we have comparison to norway be sheer focus on try to squeeze as much taxation out of the industry as possible without focus on how to become more competitive do the hon gentleman agree that what we need for job and for energy security in the uk be to compare ourselves to the most competitive oil and gas economy in the world and not those that squeeze and tax the most out of the industry and kill job exactly the hon gentleman raise the question of job and the government be play fast and loose with job in the oil and gas sector they be play russian roulette they do not seem to understand that when what they have get wrong come home to roost they can not just say sorry we get that wrong when it be go it be go they can not bring it back this be not we be already in the close chapter of the sector it will not be come back this government seem to completely misunderstand that the simple truth be that the uk state can not meet net zero or create green growth if labour policy to hack away at investment in both the domestic workforce and the sector be allow to progress it be clear that the labour party be abandon scotland exist energy sector and put at risk the just transition into the bargain with these change to the epl labour will be create the bad of all world it will starve industry of investment sacrifice the job of those who can deliver net zero threaten energy security keep energy bill high and harm the economy of scotland while at the very same time fail to invest the money require to truly deliver against green transition analysis from oeuk show that the uk oil and gas sector total tax yield under labour increase to the epl will peak in before decline compare with the previous scenario which would continue to increase treasury receipt over the period the analysis show that while the expect tax take from scotland oil and gas producer would increase in the very short term ultimately over the remainder of the period it will result in billion loss in receipt to the treasury compare with the current regime it be head the sector win and tail the government lose if the labour party do not care about the job that will be cost by this policy the harm it will do to our prospect for just transition or the damage to the scottish economy surely it can see that tax increase that reek of incoherent desperation and reduce tax receipt to the tune of billion be at the very least suboptimal do not expect the government to take it from but they might want to pay attention to the first one head for the door apache which say the onerous financial impact of the epl combine with the substantial investment that will be necessary to comply with regulatory requirement make production of hydrocarbon beyond uneconomic oeuk have say that this policy will undermine the uk offshore energy sector ability to support the government overarch goal of drive economic growth and that it will trigger an accelerated decline of domestic production and corresponding reduction in taxis and job support and the wide economic value generate the chief economist at the institute of directors have say that the autumn tax rise have dent confidence in the environment for business in the uk do not expect the government to listen to but they really should listen to those at the forefront of our invaluable energy sector in closing ask the minister to address this point directly what impact assessment have the government make of the investment horizon for oil and gas in the north sea rise to speak briefly in support of new clause welcome the government finally scrap the unfair investment allowance loophole for the oil and gas giant which the liberal democrats have advocate for and call for since the previous government introduce the levy too late and half heartedly in may oil and gas company make eye water profit off the back of russia invasion of ukraine and global supply chain problem that cause energy price to soar while the oil and gas giant see record profit my constituent in bath and other across the country face cost of living crisis the previous government have lot to answer for they sit and watch as the oil and gas giant line their pocket off the back of people struggle with their bill it do not have to be that way interruption conservative member do not want to hear it but it do not have to be that way those be the political choice the previous government make the measure announce by the government in this bill be welcome in particular the removal of the investment allowance except for investment on decarbonisation this have be liberal democrat policy and be pleased the government have pick up on it and that it will now become reality we liberal democrats be the first to call for tax on oil and gas windfall profit back in october while the previous government do eventually introduce the energy profit levy they do so half heartedly and woefully late in may it matter that we repeat that again and again it be something that the previous government fail to do that government let the oil and gas giant off the hook by put in place massive loophole in the form of the investment allowance it be thank to that allowance that in shell admit it have pay zero windfall tax despite make the large global profit in its year history of billion that can not be right while our constituent have be struggle to pay their bill my hon friend the member for st albans daisy cooper have table new clause which would require the government as we have already hear to produce report about the fiscal impact of the bill change to the epl and relief for investment expenditure we can not lose sight of the big picture to avoid repeat of the energy crisis we must end our reliance on oil and gas invest in renewable would mean cheap energy across the country we would no long be reliant on dictator such as vladimir putin who use natural gas as weapon as well as be more affordable renewable be the good route to energy security it be very disappointing to hear conservative members advocate for business as usual we need to transition away from oil and gas thank the hon lady for give way at what point do she believe we will be fully reliant on renewable thank the hon lady for her intervention it be absolutely by put in place the measure for transition that we will meet net zero if we continue with business as usual and continue to listen to people who ultimately do not understand that unless we get to net zero our whole economy will suffer then people will suffer we will also have big big problem with issue such as huge migration if climate change can rule unchallenged this be why the liberal democrats believe the transition to net zero be important and why we need to put measure in place to make that happen it be disappointing that the conservatives as the previous government and now the opposition still do not understand how urgently we require climate action be very grateful to the hon lady for give way what be her understanding of what will happen to domestic consumption of oil and gas product in the united kingdom if the domestic industry atrophy but domestic demand still exist what will happen in that scenario where will the oil and gas come from or will we just give it up overnight thank the hon gentleman for that intervention the whole argument be that we will continue to rely on oil and gas for the time being but unless we start to change something on the current projection we will not get to net zero as urgently as we need to progress have be too slow so the long we hesitate the more difficult it will become the new government have understand that urgency and the liberal democrats support they in deal with this issue with more urgency than we see from the previous government therefore repeat that we support the measure but we would like the government to support our new clause as say it will show what we can raise by close the loophole it would by extension as my hon friend the member for st albans clarify show what have be squander by the previous government money that could have be invest accord to the new economics foundation the previous government levy raise billion for the oil and gas industry but the industry invest only billion of that in new capital project take the remainder as sheer profit do the hon lady agree with that that be exactly why it be foolhardy proposal the profit make do not go into investing in new capital asset but largely go into shareholder pocket indeed could not agree more and thank the hon gentleman for clarify the figure that be why something need to change and something need to give repeat that hope government members can support our new clause because it matter it will lay open what have be squander and what difference we could make if we close the loophole call yuan yang thank you ms ghani apologise for my inconsistent bob be still learn when to stand up but what have go up and stay up be the record profit of the oil and gas major will start my speech on that topic and will go on to speak about where those profit have come from and finally what the proceed of our epl will go to fund first on those record profit think all member of the committee agree that the record profit in the oil and gas industry in be excessive in however the profit for shell the large oil and gas major in europe barely decrease from the previous year in fact if we take its profit from the first half of this year shell look likely to eclipse even those of last year in the first half of this year shell have have profit of billion half of that go to share buyback which do nothing to fund the decarbonisation that be so necessary to secure the future of energy production here in the uk and around the world those record profit much of which have be hand back to shareholder be go in the opposite direction of what ordinary family and work people need rather than reinvest in the transition of the future would argue that the conservative party be look at the industry of the past and cling on to past that be quickly fade from reality secondly let we look at where those profit have come from the house of commons library state that generally low wholesale price in the last year lead supplier to start offer fix tariff as of summer however they have be far more cautious in price those tariff with price close to the level of the energy cap any return to competition in the market be expect to be slow that reflect the state of affair we face today the wholesale price of oil and gas as an example look at the price of brent crude in the market today be back below the level they be pre the russian invasion of ukraine yet the retail price face ordinary work family in the uk be still far above those level what happen in the middle the profit be be take by the oil and gas company largely they be not be reinveste in the productive sector of the future but be pay back to shareholder in any market where the return of competition be expect to be slow there be role for the government to regulate the fair share of proceed who get the surplus from that market here pause and say that when we look across the committee to who be argue for the interest of work people and who be argue for the interest of the oil and gas profit make giant the political division be clear there be school in my constituency that be fundraise to insulate themselves the maiden erlegh school where live be ask its parent association to provide well wooden frame for its window because they leak in winter that be the public estate that our government have be elect to fix and repair we will set about do so with the profit from the levy set out in the bill we be discuss today thank the hon member for give way she say it be clear who be on the side of work people versus the company my constituent be the people work in the oil and gas sector they be the one most at risk of lose their job if the change bring in through the epl go wrong be on the side of work people and be on the side of my constituent no matter what mps across the house say will always fight for my work people in gordon and buchan who just happen to be work people in the oil and gas sector thank the hon lady for her intervention and at this point refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my support from the unionised voice of those who work in the sector to which she refer commend the government green prosperity plan to initiate skill transition and provide funding for it so that those worker can profit from the industry of the future rather than the industry of the present and the past as the minister say the energy profit levy will raise billion over the current parliament which will go towards the funding of for instance great british energy gb energy whose headquarters be in aberdeen will bring innovation in green technology not only to scotland but to the whole of the uk will forgive for moment the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan for perhaps not recognise my hon friend the member for hamilton and clyde valley imogen walker know that an awful lot of new scottish members be elect in the last general election and it must be difficult to learn all their face ask the hon member to reflect on the possible reason for the election of record number of scottish labour members while he set about learn their name and face the government auction of wind solar and tidal energy project in the late round of the contract for difference scheme point the way to the future it point the way to the generation of of the uk energy through green and decarbonise energy by to transition that everyone in this committee and certainly everyone on the government benches be look forward to see in the next year and to the delivery of the local power plan which will support local energy project in community such as mine welcome the funding of local project such as reading hydro which take hydroelectric energy from the thames and the work of reading community energy society which generate solar energy on the rooftop of the university of reading and rooftop across my constituency look forward to all those project and to the project of the future which be why commend the measure that we be discuss today the government have set number of objective that they wish to achieve over the next five year central to those objective be growth highly pay job energy security and increase investment however when look at clause to ask myself have the government go mad they be undermine the very objective that they be seek to achieve through their policy of taxation policy that believe be drive more by green ideology and by prejudice against some high earn company than by any economic logic the economic logic of these proposal and indeed the prediction make by those who have feed in the datum and the information about they indicate that at least in our major oil and energy industry investment will go down production will go down and highly pay job will go down the hon member for earley and woodley yuan yang say that her be the party that be interested in ordinary worker as have already be point out no scottish labour members be take part in the debate suggest that the worker in scotland who depend on the oil and gas industry feel abandon today because there be no one here to defend they although have to say that if be scottish member might not want to stick my head over the parapet defend measure such as these and then have to go back to my constituent to explain suspect that they will go through the lobby and vote for those measure the hon member for hamilton and clyde valley imogen walker be open her arm and say that she be from scotland look forward to hear she speak later in the debate in defence of these measure which will cost job we have hear that those job will be replace by highly pay skilled job in the renewable industry but there be little evidence of that so far indeed if we look at the source of the material and the provider of for instance wind turbine we see that the skilled job be not in britain we be make ourselves dependent on country such as china which have control of the earth metal and valuable metal that be require to provide the necessary equipment for the renewable industry the right hon member have touch on an important point meet the government target and create the green job to which he have refer will require two technology that have not yet be try and test at scale carbon capture and battery storage why would we gamble such an important job industry in favour of technology that have not even be try and test at scale it be not just that they have not be try and test there be also an acceptance indeed it be the government own state position that even with those technology we will be reliant on and will need oil and gas not until and not even until but beyond if we do not extract as much oil and gas from our own resource here in the united kingdom where will we get it from we will get it from abroad which bring we to the issue of energy security the place where energy be likely to be produce will not be stable country country that will always be favourable towards we or country that be rule by rational ruler it will come from country where ruler be irrational and take political decision about who they do or do not trade with on whim the idea that we will rely on fossil fuel until well beyond but not produce they ourselves in fact we be go to discourage company from produce they in the united kingdom even though we know that we have the resource and somehow or other we will still guarantee security of supply and security of energy for our constituent be just madness have very simple question to ask the right hon gentleman do he believe that climate change be happen and that we need to get to net zero by or do he believe it be all hoax only fool would say that climate change be not happen climate change have occur in all the time that the earth have be in existence of course it happen and of course it be happen the hon lady ask question to which think anybody could give an easy answer yes climate change be happen but do that mean that we have identify all the source of the change in our climate do it also mean that we should distort our economy in such way as she would suggest to try to make change to the world climate especially give that other country be not make any change to their economy and be not follow our lead they be simply ignore we and do what they believe be good for their own economy the second point want to make be that we be leave ourselves open to situation in which company that we need to invest in energy production will not do so the obr have make that quite clear but even if it have not make its prediction economic logic should make we understand that if we take investment allowance away from people and tax they they will have less money to invest the minister make great point by put all these measure on the statute book he create certainty for the industry he do create certainty because anybody look at the bill know for certain what the future entail they be go to be tax until the pip squeak so they will look for other place to go and make their investment he argue that put out tax plan somehow give assurance to company but sometimes it confirm their prejudice that britain will not be place where they have future or where they wish to invest turn to the third impact of these measure build on point make by the hon member for earley and woodley the government whole approach be to tax oil and gas company get money and help work people by put it into school and so on but the prediction be that we will not get more revenue because if there be less production there be less tax to be pay if there be less tax to be pay the government have less revenue to invest in the thing that hon member on both side of the house would wish they to invest in where do that tax go it will go to foreign country because that be where production will take place and where the oil company will be tax they will get tax where they make their profit if they be not make any profit in the united kingdom they will not pay any revenue in the united kingdom they will take their production and tax revenue elsewhere there do not appear to be any economic logic to this proposal other than that the oil company be see as bad so the government have to tax they even though they be tax heavily already and that the government want to ensure that we have this transition to net zero even though we know that we will still need the product that the oil company produce for many decade into the future and we will be turn our back on that production in the united kingdom if the government be so sure that this cunning plan be go to work think baldrick would have be embarrass by this cunning plan have to say they should not fear any examination of it they should welcome it in fact maybe once the assessment be do they will be able to point to red face on the opposition side of the house if be as certain as the minister be that his plan be go to work would be say right we do the assessment and we make you eat your word suspect that the reason that new clause will be reject today be that the red face and the eating of word be go to be on the government side of the house unfortunately the people who will suffer will be the hundred of thousand of people face rise fuel bill the worker who will face redundancy and an industry that we very much need in this country go into decline on point of order madam chair the last but one speaker the hon member for earley and woodley yuan yang call out regard my perfectly legitimate comment that there be not single scottish labour mp in here choose my word carefully take part in this debate appreciate that there be labour member here who unless be very much mistaken be fulfil the role of parliamentary private secretary and therefore will not be take part in the debate ask your guidance madam chair on whether it be legitimate to call somebody out in debate and not give they an opportunity to respond try to intervene on the hon member for earley and woodley to correct the record but she refuse to give way how can we correct the record to underline the fact that there be not single scottish labour mp in here take part in this debate on scotland energy the hon gentleman will be aware that that be not matter for the chair and therefore can not provide advice as to how he can put that on the record he will know as well as other hon member do that it be entirely at the discretion of the individual contribute at that time whether or not they take an intervention but he have do good work in put his point on the record via the mechanism of point of order would like to echo the argument make by the hon member for earley and woodley yuan yang and for bath wera hobhouse rise to speak to whether clause and schedule should stand part of the bill argue that both should be omit to remove the propose new tax relief for carbon capture and storage installation as currently draft the tax regime for oil and gas be riddle with relief exemption and loophole the windfall tax introduce by the last government be widely report but be slightly less reported be the increase tax relief that go along with it which allow oil and gas company to deduct of their capital investment cost from their tax bill we be now many year into an escalating climate crisis and one that the oil company have know they be cause since at least there be absolutely no excuse for public subsidy that incentivise fossil fuel company to expand their operation so while welcome the increase in the rate of the energy profit levy and the reduction of the investment allowance want to highlight the fact that because of other relief that still exist north sea oil and gas company will still be able to offset of capital expenditure against tax in relation to their expansion of operation do the hon gentleman accept that capital relief be about attract investment that create job and secure energy security for this country if uk country be to make such investment we have to be competitive in the global market if we do not make those investment what do he think will happen to the industry and the job that go with it as we hear early it be vital that there be strong government support and dedicated plan to ensure transition to alternative job opportunity for anyone work in the oil and gas sector have background in the renewable energy sector strongly support government incentive and policy that will help that sector to expand so that we create job and skill my amendment would reverse the government tax relief on the conversion of oil and gas infrastructure to carbon capture and storage installation there be many other relief in the tax regime that should be address but they be out of the scope of the bill carbon capture and storage be complex area there be different type of technology that use different technique support further research and development in relation to the hard to abate sector but ccs can not be use as fig leaf to hide the expansion of fossil fuel operation in reality after year of hype the result be very little carbon less than of annual emission be capture globally most of the carbon dioxide that have be successfully capture have be use to extract more oil the uk have also be criticise for target most of its ccs at so call blue hydrogen the use of which would increase our long term reliance on gas and generate more carbon emission the propose tax relief be too blunt an instrument to make useful contribution to decarbonisation the role of ccs be still relatively untested so it be vital that we do not bake in over reliance on that technology public funding for ccs should be restrict to research and development and to project that would clearly help to decarbonise hard to abate sector it absolutely must not be green light for fossil fuel company to carry on with business as usual and an expansion of operation will the minister explore the idea of review the measure in the light of what have suggest in october we liberal democrats be the first to call for tax on oil and gas windfall profit so be glad that the bill be finally scrap the unfair investment allowance loophole after year of oil and gas company not pay their fair share under the conservatives urge the house to adopt our amendment which call on the government to set out exactly how much money be be raise through the scrapping of the investment allowance loophole and how much money be gift by the last government to the oil and gas giant my constituent in yeovil deserve full transparency encourage the government to use the money raise by close the loophole to address energy and environmental issue impact my constituent in yeovil such as fuel poverty particularly among pensioner the need to protect home and business from flooding the need to support farmer with green investment and help homeowner to install clean heating in conclusion we must ensure that our constituency get fair deal out of the bill if the average taxpayer be expect to pay their fair share then so must the wealthy individual and company in this country there can not be one rule for they and another for the rest of we thank hon member for their contribution to the debate will respond to some of the point raise and set out the government view on the new clause the opposition spokesperson the hon member for grantham and bourne gareth davies ask for confirmation of our decision to retain the energy security investment mechanism hope that he will take yes for an answer because yes can confirm that the esim will remain in effect until march when the energy profit levy be due to end it will continue to be adjust in line with consumer price index inflation in future financial year hope that set his mind at rest on that point the hon gentleman ask about model the impact of the energy profit levy be sure that he will remember from his time in the treasury the role that the office for budget responsibility play he will see that in the report that it publish alongside the budget it forecast billion be raise from the levy over the forecast period of course the obr will provide update forecast next year the hon gentleman and other hon member keep raise the phrase extraordinary profit when talk about try to understand the position that the oil and gas sector be in that link directly to the energy security investment mechanism because price remain high than the price floor that we set the energy security investment mechanism mean that if price fall sufficiently and return to historically normal level the levy will be disapplie the relationship between the levy profit and the maintenance of the energy security investment mechanism be key to understand the government approach the liberal democrats spokesperson the hon member for st albans daisy cooper ask about our choose rate how we set the rate for the energy profit levy and about other attribute of the system be set up by the clause under debate we seek to achieve balanced approach we be raise the rate to extend the levy for further year and remove the investment allowance which we deem to be unjustifiably generous yet we be maintain first year allowance the decarbonisation allowance and the energy security investment mechanism that strike the right balance between ensure that oil and gas company continue to invest in oil and gas for year to come and ensure that they contribute to and support the transition to clean energy the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan speak about the need for long term stability entirely agree that we need it that be precisely what we seek to achieve by say that the energy profit levy will come to an end in march by have price floor in the esim we have mention that several time and by proceed with our consultation on the post energy profit levy regime that will give confidence to those think about invest in the oil and gas sector not just before the end of the energy profit levy but post the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson also mention long term stability he seem distract right now but hope that will be of some reassurance to he the hon member for angus and perthshire glens say that investment relief be available in norway whereas the figure be in the uk want to put on record that in the uk while the energy profit levy remain in place the sector continue to benefit from an relief for every of investment hope that give he some reassurance on the point that he raise thank my hon friend the member for earley and woodley yuan yang for her thoughtful and informed contribution which explain that our approach strike the right balance must say however that be disappoint by the contribution from the hon member for waveney valley adrian ramsay because he seem not to support our move to ensure that tax be not blocker to ccus which will play an essential role in our progress towards net zero the uk have chance to be world leader in that sector hop that he would support our effort to ensure that it be two new clause be table which hon member speak about they require report to be publish can remember table many such new clause over the last few year new clause table by the hon member for st albans would require the government to produce report set out the fiscal impact of the removal of the energy profit levy investment allowance and the change to the decarbonisation investment allowance rate new clause table by the right hon member for central devon mel stride would require the government to produce report on the expect impact of the levy change in number of area include on capital expenditure in the uk oil and gas industry and on the scottish economy the government oppose new clause and on the basis that they be unnecessary we have already set out the impact of our measure in tax information and impact note which be publish at the time of the budget that note state that the change make to the energy profit levy will raise an additional billion over the scorecard and further datum on the uk oil and gas industry be regularly publish on hope that have address some of the point raise by hon member and have reassure they that the new clause be not necessary urge the house to let clause to and schedule stand part of the bill and to reject new clause and question put and agree to clause accordingly order to stand part of the bill clause to order to stand part of the bill schedule agree to new clause report on fiscal effect relief for investment expenditure the chancellor of the exchequer must within six month of the passing of this act lie before parliament report set out the impact of the

solution to many real world challenge such as armed conflict political and social exclusion and economic inequality and goodness do we not need that in the world right now let highlight key provision of the declaration the right to life which be of course fundamental to the enjoyment of every other right that we be here to protect categorical violation of the right to life include extra judicial killing the misuse of the death penalty or would argue the use of it at all life threaten prison condition which we have see in the footage from syria in recent hour and day the use of live ammunition by police force against unarmed protestor serious violation of humanitarian law and environmental degradation and climate change which give rise to serious threat to the existence of present and future generation tragically the right to life be violate in many country by state and non state actor include china north korea myanmar afghanistan russia iran saudi arabia the democratic republic of congo burundi eritrea sudan south sudan colombia and mexico to name just few be sorry to say would like to express the appg deep concern about the killing of human right defender brave people from all walk of life community leader environmental activist lawyer journalist trade unionist academic and member of non governmental organisation who be committed to promote and protect the human right of their community in their country and the wide world the appg have be privileged to meet many inspire human right defender over the year their work document violation hold human right violator to account and tackle cycle of impunity may result in serious threat include harassment smear campaign physical attack arbitrary detention torture and in the bad case murder environmental and land right defender be at particular risk the non governmental organisation global witness estimate that in land and environmental defender be kill around the world the high number by far be in colombia follow by brazil mexico honduras and nicaragua during my time as shadow minister for latin america visit colombia and meet trade unionist and human right defender who face violent attack every single day two week ago meet representative of the wiwa indigenous people of the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern colombia to hear their testimony at first hand here in our parliament thank the hon gentleman my hon friend for secure this debate on such an important day he be right to draw particular attention to the experience of defender of indigenous community and environmental right defender in colombia and elsewhere back in october in my capacity as vice chair of the all party parliamentary human right group host roundtable here in parliament with speaker from the colombia caravana it bring together lawyer from country who have recently conduct fact find trip in colombia they highlight the increase power of illegal armed group particularly in area with no or limited state presence and the serious threat that those group pose to human right defender we hear powerful testimony from the leader of an indigenous people reserve who speak of the threat to which his community be subject and call for the uk government to do everything possible to ensure that uk company be hold to account for the impact of their action would the hon gentleman support his call thank the hon lady for her intervention for her work as an officer of the appg and for chairing that meeting be slightly late for it but be there for most of it and hear those testimony of course would support that call think it important for we to recognise the extraordinarily brave and courageous work of people like those who be there on that day such as the human right defender from peru from whom we hear very recently and the representative of the wiwa people of colombia whom mention all over the world human right defender be put their life their safety and their freedom at risk to defend their land and their right against rapacious company that be exploit they because no one will protect they except themselves thank the hon lady for her support and for all the work that she be do with president gustavo petro we have renew hope in colombia but sadly the attack continue give that the uk be the penholder for colombia at the united nations should be grateful if the minister reaffirm our commitment to what the colombians call paz total or total peace as have say indigenous people continue to be disproportionately target account for of total murder the uk and like minded country must help to support and protect human right defender understand that to this end the uk support for human rights defenders guidance publish in be be review and should be interested to know whether the minister have an update on when we can expect that review to be publish give the crucial role that human right defender play in foster peace justice and inclusive development ask the foreign commonwealth and development office to consider elevate the guidance to more comprehensive strategy with benchmark for official and post which could then be adapt to specific country situation can not speak about the importance of the universal declaration without highlight another of its central provision equality article state everyone be entitle to all the right and freedom set forth in this declaration without distinction of any kind such as race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national or social origin property birth or other status believe that all parliamentarian be horrify by the treatment of woman and girl in some part of the world particularly afghanistan congratulate my hon friend on an excellent speech and on secure debate on such an important day he rightly mention afghanistan and the issue around the discrimination of woman and girl in that great country should the uk consider join the think country that be involve in an action at the international court of justice because of their concern about breach of the un convention on the elimination of all form of discrimination against woman yes and would be interested to hear from our minister whether we should join that action because in some way or another we really need to draw the world attention more clearly and in more focused way to the shocking appalling and totally unjustifiable treatment of woman and girl in afghanistan and indeed other part of the world until the sex in this world be equal we will not have the peace justice and development that all humanity deserve under this government we rightly have relentless focus on tackle violence against woman and girl in our country but that focus should extend across the world as have say it be simply incomprehensible stress this again that in the century the taliban can completely silence afghan woman and girl almost erase their very existence and bar they from education and public life extremely courageous woman who protest against these violation face the most terrifying consequence include enforce disappearance arbitrary detention and torture just today hear an example of how this work on the ground in afghanistan be tell by somebody who know the country well and who be not an afghan that he recently speak to afghan doctor and midwife about the problem that many afghan woman experience when give birth especially in remote rural area birth complication can lead to all sort of other horror include the death of baby at birth under special exception the taliban have allow woman to work as doctor and midwife thank goodness but problem arise if female midwife or doctor be stop by as he put it bearded man while she walk to work from where she live she will be stop and question and sometimes return home as woman and girl can no long get the training or education necessary to become gynaecologist obstetrician specialist doctor clinician or midwife there be time bomb tick in this field of work among other in afghanistan it be extremely disturbing our appg be worried about democratic back slide globally and the consequent erosion of political and civil right such as freedom of expression assembly and association accord to the economist intelligence unit democracy index less than of the world population live in full proper democracy in almost live under authoritarian rule share that have be creep up in recent year do not need to remind hon member that this be happen because we be all aware of it every single day we hear story of parliaments and parliamentary democracy under attack electoral autocracy be become more prevalent sham election be hold in largely unsuccessful attempt to provide veneer of political legitimacy will not name country but we all know who they be the increase in violent conflict as see in russia and the middle east have stifle progress towards more meaningful political participation it would be helpful to know more about how our government will continue to promote and support democracy across the world and close to home whether the defend democracy taskforce still have role to play in protect the uk democratic integrity from threat of foreign interference really appreciate the hon member bring this matter to the house today it be incumbent on all of we to ensure that we do everything we can to stand up for human right whether at home or abroad the need to stand up for democracy not only in the world in which we live physically but online be also real concern for and many across the house do he agree that we need to do everything we can to ensure that election not just here but across the world and the tenet of democracy be protect as we struggle to deal with those who would love to erode the fundamental freedom and human right that we hold dear thank the hon

example of that interference that hack and those bot as they call they create post for non existent individual on our social medium urge people to do something or to vote in particular way and quote sham fact and figure that be make up or invent to persuade people to make decision that would be against their interest or inclination in connection with the latter note grow worry about transnational repression when authoritarian government reach across their border to silence dissent among diaspora community and exile include through illegal deportation abduction digital threat attack and family intimidation indeed we have hear example in recent year of bbc world service correspondent in london have their family intimidate harass or even arrest by the authority in iran those people have nothing whatever to do with the work that their family member be do here in london but they be none the less pay the price for that freedom to broadcast that freedom of information and the brilliant work that the bbc world service do the uk have not be immune to this as have just say and be pleased that our government have recognise that individual live here who have leave russia hong kong china

violence or harassment parliamentarian be often the so call canary in the coal mine if the human right of parliamentarian be be violate the situation of those in that country who do not have wide popular backing or the high profile of local mp be likely to be far far bad therefore urge my hon friend the minister to make it clear that this government will put human right and peace building at

to encourage support for the international criminal court and the importance of international law more specifically parliamentarian have key role to play in ensure government compliance with human
