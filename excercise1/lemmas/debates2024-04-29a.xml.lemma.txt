oral answers to questions education the secretary of state be ask child with special educational needs and disabilities what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability we will all know somebody with special educational need or disability and understand how vital it be to get child with special educational need or disability the right support early on in recent year we have see massive increase in special educational need in our country which be why we have expand funding to record level at billion up by in the last five year and why we be reform the system to deal with the increase in demand include the big investment in build special educational need school place in our country history child in lewisham be wait on average two and half year to get an autism diagnosis this be wrong and unacceptable it be also national issue but it be make bad by shortage of clinical staff the government be fail to recognise the seriousness of the shortage of educational psychologist can the secretary of state tell why they have fail and what be be do to recruit more educational psychologist as well as to tackle education health and care plan wait time thank the hon lady for her question around half of new ehcp be issue within the statutory time limit of week and some local authority be deliver over but of course we recognise that the system be under pressure post both the pandemic and the massive rise in demand for special educational need support that be why we have increase the budget and put an improvement plan in place with regard to her question about educational psychologist we be train more which be big increase have constituent it could be many of the constituent who come to who have child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder autism and other severe learn difficulty she have to wait an awful long time for an ehcp for her child and in the end the plan list the very school that say it can not cope with the need of the child this happen routinely school that say it can not cope be still list on the ehcp what be the secretary of state do to ensure that council and other people who do the ehcp be not just ignore what the school say and be actually put down the school that can cope with the need my constituent child now have only one hour week of education that be surely not good enough we need to do all we can to support child with special educational need they be vulnerable and need the support as early as possible we have programme in place to support local authority but the big thing that we be do be increase the number of special educational need school place this will be the large increase in more school place and it be in stark contrast to when labour be last in power when the number of place reduce by that be something we be very focused on do many of those have already be deliver some be work in progress and some will be in the hon member area far too many family know what battle it can be to secure an ehcp assessment for their child but for force family this battle can become recur nightmare as they be force to restart the process all over again if require to move base before it complete it can not be right that those who sacrifice so much for our country be so let down by the current assessment system how can we put this right of course we be always look to improve the system and we do have an improvement plan in place will take away the hon gentleman specific point about people who move around from place to place but the most important and fundamental thing be that we have increase the budget which have now go up to billion increase in the last few year we be also invest in build the right provision the number of educational psychologist and the workforce we have thorough plan in place and we be work to deliver it parent in portsmouth be rightly concerned that few than half of the primary schoolchildren in the city be achieve the expect standard in reading writing and math while under the watch of the lib dem run council waiting list for send support continue to rise do the secretary of state agree that family in portsmouth deserve well than council that be fail child and fail family yes and that be the conservative government the royal college of psychiatrists have find that autistic child be time more likely to think about or attempt suicide than other child not get the support they need can affect autistic child into their adult life this be matter of extreme concern as be the fact that more than wirral child be persistently absent from school in which be double the pre pandemic figure note the minister early comment but what assessment have the government make of the percentage of child in wirral and across england who be miss from school and who have special educational need and disability what specific measure will the government take to address their need the hon lady be right to identify the crossover between special educational need and absence from school this can sometimes result in poor outcome which can lead to mental health issue later that be why it be important that we get early help to child as quickly as possible we have special educational need and alternative provision improvement plan and in term of workforce which be the most important thing on top of the place we be train more special educational need co ordinator we have change the training for new teacher we be make sure that we invest in new national professional qualification to upskill teacher and we have more educational more in training and more speech and language therapist there be huge workforce element in the plan to improve our special educational need offer call the chair of the select committee welcome what secretary state have just say about the workforce and it be vital that we get that into place but week on from the publication of the buckland review and two year on from the education committee call to bolster career support for child with sen can she update we on what ministers and the department be do to work with the department for work and pensions to provide wide opportunity for young people with autism we all know that most people with learning disability want to work and with the right support they can work the send code of practice be clear that all child and young people with special educational need should be prepare for adulthood include employment we be invest million in support internship programme which be very successful and we will be double this by march we be work with the dwp on number of programme and follow the buckland review the dwp be set up task group to consider all the recommendation with rise in complex need fund over five year reach billion in with million of funding for special free school in the spring budget and with the special educational need and disability and alternative provision plan to support everyone with need and disability to age do my right hon friend agree that it be this conservative government that be work hard for the life chance of every child in our country absolutely right my hon friend be also right to say that we should take no lesson from the opposition on support child with send let we not forget that the number of child benefit from be in special school fall probably because there be no specific high need fund at all for local authority to support people with special educational need in contrast we be invest record funding and we be obviously build more place than we ever have in our country history only the conservatives have plan to support child with send in all my year in teaching before come to this place experience only one episode of violence at the hand of student when they hurl chair at across the classroom be six month pregnant then only one episode in all those many many year but increasingly teach staff be tell that this be become more and more commonplace in fact they expect it my most recent conversation about this be on saturday when teaching assistant say that they have finally be force to retire because they could not cope with the stress any more some of this will be due to unmet or unrecognised special educational need and thank the secretary of state for outline all the provision that be be make indeed have new special school in my constituency but some be not will she meet to discuss some specific local concern yes be sorry to hear about the situation of the teacher in my hon friend constituency of course good behaviour be the bedrock of school and school standard we be invest more in behaviour hub which be help school that need help with the behaviour of child we be also invest more in alternative provision school we be build new one be already open and the rest will be open in the come year in essex it have be take far too long for child to get their education health and care plan so be pleased to hear that the county council have just recruit additional member of staff it be also build new special school include two more in chelmsford but what can make difference be specialist hub within mainstream school help child from that school and from neighbouring school give that we have large number of school be rebuild in essex due to reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete raac do the secretary of state agree that this could provide an opportunity and that we should look at all the school that be due to be rebuild and consider put specialist hub into those rebuilding programme my right hon friend mention the considerable investment that be go into special educational need and high need budget there be also provision for capital to build new free school and school place as we look to rebuild some of the school affect by raac which have now all be identify every school have its budget detail we urge local authority to consider what will well meet the need of young people in their area there be flexibility on free school place as well those school look at what to come forward with as regard provision that be need to address local need call the shadow minister coram childcare survey find that just of local authority be confident that they will have enough childcare place for disabled child high quality early year education be essential in ensure that child need be identify at the most important time for their development the child minister the hon member for wantage david johnston do not give clear answer on this last month and his statement last week make no reference to disabled child be the secretary of state really confident that every eligible family with disabled child have be able to access childcare place as part of the april expansion yes or no will expand on the yes or no as the hon lady want clear answer and obviously have not hear the clear answer that she be give before local authority have statutory duty to provide place for all child include those with special educational need but we be work with organisation such as dingley promise to review special educational need inclusion and to see what more we can do to encourage provider to far consider what they can do to provide place however we will work with local authority to make sure that we improve this apprenticeship achievements what assessment she have make of trend in the number of apprenticeship achievement the proportion of apprentice who achieve their apprenticeship standard rise to in which be up percentage point on the year before we be take action to ensure that every apprentice have high quality experience we be review and improve standard where there be poor achievement rate we be invest million in the provider workforce development programme and ofsted will be inspect all provider by give all young people good education be key to level up our country yet the number of apprenticeship start have fall by third over the last decade and there be few completion than three year ago we have improve on last year but we be not there yet why have the government let the number of offer and available apprenticeship slide and why do the minister think that young people be not qualify at the rate they be three year ago we want all young people to have access to good high quality apprenticeship because they offer valuable experience and an opportunity to upskill at the start of their career we have see increase in apprenticeship start by young people under the age of so far this year and of all start have be by those age under last year we see increase in apprenticeship achievement in the hon lady constituency that be welcome news but of course there be always more to do be very happy to work with she on the issue be it not the case that apprenticeship achievement have go up by over the past year that over of apprentice who complete their apprenticeship get good job or good skill and that start be go up too be it not also the case that we now have more than quality apprenticeship standard in everything from aeronautic to zoology and that any attempt to dilute the apprenticeship levy would not only destroy the number of start but harm achievement it be this side of the house that be build an apprenticeship and skill nation during his time as minister my right hon friend help to completely rebuild the apprenticeship system introduce high quality standard apprenticeship be now long well and have more off the job training with proper independent assessment at the end they be more value by employer and we have see million start since he be an incredible advocate for further education follow he in this role learn very quickly that have big shoe to fill look forward to work with he to ensure that we continue deliver in this area call the shadow minister the truth be that not only have apprenticeship start plummet since but new datum show that the overall achievement rate have drop since with level apprenticeship hit hard almost half of apprentice do not complete their course which be simply not good enough employer be call out for reform but this government have their head in the sand be this not yet more evidence that far from tackle barrier to opportunity and boost britain skill the government be fail our young people and our business and that only labour have plan to turn this around we have make apprenticeship more rigorous they be now more credible they be design by employer and have proper robust assessment the only plan labour have without more funding be to cut the number of apprenticeship start in our country by obviously the hon member miss the figure publish last week which show increase in level attainment rate we be deliver high quality standard with more off the job training and that should be welcome across the house send provision what recent assessment her department have make of the adequacy of send provision what assessment she have make of the adequacy of send provision have undertake review of the special educational need system we publish our improvement plan last year provision be regularly review through school and local area inspection by ofsted and the care quality commission we also collect and review datum on education health and care plan include on timeliness and volume and on capacity in special school send unit and resource provision last week meet the chief executive of chain of independent school which include lot of independent special school approximately of the child there have special educational need she be concern about any proposal to put vat on school fee she feel all this will do be put up school fee and lot of parent who be just about manage to send their kid to independent special school will take they out put more pressure on the state education send system do the minister share my concern that although people may think that this policy be smart politic it may be people with special educational need include those on low income household who pay the price for this short sighted policy proposal my hon friend be great champion of child with sen and he be absolutely right labour ideological obsession with private school mean that it will even charge child in an independent special school vat for their need that will make it hard for those family to afford the provision they need and drive up demand for place in state special school it be just another example of the mess labour would make of our education system the inequality in the funding formula be drive inequality for child with sen in york we be see not only the lack of placement that be need but staff be lay off because of an inadequacy of funding we know that the number of child with send be grow exponentially in york so will the minister not only review the funding formula to ensure that it be fair but give local authority the power and provision to provide for the future need of our city york be in our safety valve programme to provide support with the financial challenge it have it have see increase in per head funding in the last three financial year we review the funding formula every year the big complaint people have be the historic factor which be difficult to reduce quickly because there be child receive that provision at the moment wyre forest school special school in kidderminster have be do fantastic job for number of year but it have be run way past its maximum capacity for some time there be potential for relief when its next door neighbour baxter college secure funding from generous grant from the school rebuilding programme for mutually beneficial rebuilding to expand capacity on both side however with that project be in phase wyre forest school and baxter college may have to wait until before they can see any beneficial relief will the minister or the secretary of state meet and the head of the two school to discuss how we can expedite get this rebuilding programme under way would be very happy to meet my hon friend on saturday meet lady who have move within shropshire but into north shropshire and it take week for her year son with sen to be place in school it be one without any one to one support which be big downgrade on his previous situation his parent report to that all he have receive from the school be detention for not complete his work fast enough we be desperately short of sen place in shropshire can the minister reassure that the government be look at shropshire and work to provide proper provision for those child who be be so badly let down obviously can not comment on that specific case but can tell the hon lady that we be in the process of create more special school place there school already open and approve to open mental resilience in young people sport and pe if her department will make an assessment of the potential impact of sport and pe on mental resilience in young people it be well and widely recognise that pe and sport support child and young people health and general wellbeing the school sport and activity action plan update publish in july set out how we will support all young people to participate in pe and sport in school recently host an

discuss this success and how we can encourage more school to teach mental toughness skill through sport as part of the school sport and activity action plan know about the good work of the golf foundation under the leadership of brendon pyle would be very happy to meet my hon friend to discuss its work specifically the unleash your drive programme sport pe and outdoor education have huge impact on build resilience among young people help they to gain love of learn as well as the outdoors which can be great for they for their whole life do the minister agree that it be great shame that just the other week the welsh senedd vote down by single vote the bill propose by his colleague and my friend sam rowlands which would have make outdoor education an experience that every young person in wales could access will the minister go one furth and back my equivalent outdoor education bill which will receive its second reading on june so that this place ensure that every young person in primary and secondary school have the ability to access an outdoor education experience for free the hon gentleman have be entirely consistent for some time in talk about the importance of outdoor education about which be happy to agree be not sure it be always necessarily case for law but it be certainly important for young people to get outdoors to be in touch with nature and to see the countryside as well as run around enjoy pe and sporting activity israel and antisemitism secondary school education what step she be take to support education on israel and antisemitism in secondary school have be horrify and appal to see the rise in antisemitism in education since october it be unacceptable and it can not be tolerate my right hon friend the secretary of state have write to all school and college remind they of their duty under prevent and we be invest million to help tackle antisemitism across education my right hon friend be clearly right that the rise of antisemitism in school or anywhere be absolutely unacceptable one of the cause be the failure of school to teach child about the history of israel and the fact that jewish people have occupy israel for over year indeed the balfour declaration set up the creation of the modern state of israel as that be not communicate there be widespread ignorance and people do not believe that jewish people have occupy that land for so long will my right hon friend conduct review of the curriculum to ensure that young people be properly educate about the history of israel appreciate what my hon friend say history be very important subject for many reason learn about israel and the wide region can be cover in history for example in the challenge for britain europe and the wide world since theme in general we do not specify individual historical event in our national curriculum with the sole exception of the holocaust as he will know thank the minister for his positive and helpful response what discussion have he have with counterpart in the devolved nation in particular in northern ireland where the two different group the nationalist and the unionists the protestants and the catholics have be able to develop an understanding on education they be able to look at each other without the suspicion that may have be there or year ago have the minister have chance to talk to the devolved nation to ascertain whether introduce compulsory education on the importance of combat antisemitism be possible take the northern ireland example as one that work always value opportunity to speak to colleague and counterpart in the devolved administration believe that we will have another opportunity relatively soon to speak to the hon gentleman colleague in northern ireland and have no doubt that that will be one thing that we will wish to talk about call the snp spokesperson it be right that young people can recognise and denounce antisemitism and it be also right that they know something of the history of the region include the continue expansion of illegal settlement but hope the minister agree that right wing rhetoric and islamophobia also pose threat to our young people what step be be take to ensure that both antisemitism and anti muslim hate be treat with equal severity especially give some of the islamophobic remark that have be make by member and former member of his own party the hon lady be right to call out the wickedness of islamophobia there have be islamophobic incident in school as well and tell mama be an important resource in that regard we will not tolerate anti muslim hatred in any form and we will seek to stamp it out whenever and wheresoever it occur ms anum qaisar be not here to ask the next question but will the minister give an answer so that can bring in the opposition front bencher cost of living additional financial support for pupils what recent discussion she have have with her counterpart in the devolved administration on the potential merit of provide additional financial support to school pupil in the context of increase in the cost of living minister normally meet colleague from the devolved government as we be just discuss moment ago the

uniform trip and food come up the most labour have plan to cut the cost of school uniform by limit the number of brand item and our free breakfast club in every primary school will put money back in parent pocket while improve attendance and attainment we have do the government homework and they be still fail family will it take labour government to give every child in this country the chance that they deserve appreciate what the hon lady say but be afraid she need to keep up we have do the thing that restrict the cost pressure on uniform we regularly survey how much uniform be cost and some of those result be encouraging we also survey regularly the number of school that have second hand uniform facility available and be pleased to report that that have improve we be also very clear that when school trip be part of the national curriculum an essential thing to do there should be no charge in addition to that way many school make sure that they be provide inclusivity for all pupil and of course the pupil premium that we introduce shortly after be one of the thing that facilitate that hanwood park free school when she expect the propose hanwood park free school in kettering constituency to open be grateful to my hon friend for his question thank he for his ongoing support for this new school include his personal work to make sure that there be provision for boy and girl we be work with his council and sponsor trust to agree provisional opening date for hanwood park free school as soon as possible the new hanwood park free school be key part of the future educational infrastructure in kettering and will be locate at the heart of the hanwood park development which with house be one of the large housing development in the whole country will my right hon friend please facilitate meeting in kettering with the department regional director for the east midland the local educational authority the orbis academy trust and the hanwood park developer so that together we can ensure that the school build be co ordinated as well as possible again commend my hon friend for his work also appreciate the importance of the provision of local service none be more important than education where there be housing development would be very pleased to convene such meeting as he request read standards what step her department have take to improve standard of reading in school since we have completely transform how we teach read in england expand the evidence base method of phonic across all of our school in the phonic screen check only of our child meet the expect standard of reading thank to those reform and the hard work of our brilliant teacher not only be that number now but our primary schoolchildren have be rank fourth good reader in the world we be stick to our plan deliver high reading standard across our school thank my right hon friend for that very positive response in only of child in my borough of bexley meet the expect standard of reading now after the evidence base reform from this conservative government that number be real achievement there be still much more to be do but do she share my disappointment that the labour party oppose those reform at every opportunity my right hon friend be absolutely right the conservatives plan to reform our reading standard completely and expand phonic across our school have mean that our primary schoolchildren be now the fourth good reader in the world what be labour response it say that phonic would not work that our literacy drive be dull and that free school be dangerous what be dangerous be the risk of labour government who would collapse educational standard as labour have do in wales degree level apprenticeships what step her department be take to encourage take up of degree level apprenticeship we have see year on year growth in degree level apprenticeship start at level and increase by this year there be now more than employer design degree level apprenticeship and we be provide an additional million over two year to support provider to expand their offer last week have the pleasure of host member of this house and representative of industry and of the education sector to discuss how we could leverage the resource of the private sector to support further education through lecturer reservist programme particularly thank the minister and his predecessor my right hon friend the member for harlow robert halfon as well as hayley pells of the institute of the motor industry for all their hard work in make that meet reality and for their positive engagement would not be do my job properly if be not cheeky enough to ask whether the minister would be willing to join we for our next meeting when we will flesh out the proposal that we discuss think we have an excellent meeting last week we have really positive discussion about the exciting lecturer reservist pilot that will run in the west midland bring together regional employer college and provider look forward to work closely with my hon friend as the pilot progress and not just to meet he again but to visit the pilot when it be up and run student loan repayment plan what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the plan student loan repayment plan on level of application for university undergraduate course our reform make the student loan system more sustainable and fair for graduate and taxpayer tuition fee have be freeze until and it be this government who act to cap the interest rate on student loan because we believe that everybody in our country should have access to world class high education in january the number of application to study nursing fall by the royal college of nursing say that that could be direct threat to patient safety surely the government should be do everything they can to boost recruitment in nursing but instead last september they introduce tuition fee system that mean that future nursing graduate will pay an extra per month why be the secretary of state penalise people who choose to work in our vital public service the system that we introduce be progressive one because lifetime earning now correlate with the amount that somebody contribute the high earner make the large individual contribution and the low earner contribute the least for example someone who leave university in earn year will now pay just month repay that loan crucially the new interest rate be reduce from the retail price index plus to rpi plus which make it more affordable too it be progressive system that we think be fair for student and taxpayer call the shadow minister welcome the minister to his place it be good to see he in his new role of course we miss the former minister the right hon member for harlow robert halfon as my hon friend the member for bolton south east yasmin qureshi put it so eloquently we be in real danger of dissuade and disenfranchise so many young people from get into the sort of career in which they be interested and particularly into role such as nursing reiterate that point because we have see decline in the number of application for nursing at time when we desperately need more in our health service what be the minister do do he really think this system which be introduce ahead of his join the education team be fair one thank the hon gentleman for his word welcome to my post the point would make be that the cycle show number rebalancing and return to trend of normal growth in application follow the pandemic he should also look at the big impact nursing apprenticeship and nursing degree apprenticeship be have on the system be always happy to meet he to discuss these issue but we do think it be fair and more affordable system for both student and taxpayer and will result in more people be able to access world class high education in our country send provision bournemouth what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of send provision in school in bournemouth ofsted outcome be strong for the five special school in bournemouth departmental official continue to work with the council and other service to support rapid improvement include million of high need capital funding between and the funding allocation this year be million increase per head compare with be grateful to the minister for that reply he speak about increase funding but there be grow anger from headteacher and parent alike in bournemouth about the mismanagement of the dedicated school grant over the past couple of year by bournemouth christchurch and poole council school head have now take the unprecedented step of write open letter of concern to the council the council be not follow the require guidance and be demand unaffordable sum from school which if implement would see the loss of teach assistant ask the department for education to investigate the council decision making to ensure that correct guideline be follow in the future and that the right level of funding stay with the school my right hon friend have do an excellent job of raise with repeatedly the frustration of parent and headteacher in his constituency with bcp council and official continue to monitor that closely to ensure that school and child in his area get the provision they deserve how many child in school in bournemouth have rely on special educational need and disability provision because they have have an acquire brain injury in the last five year if the minister do not know the answer he might not know it today will he be able to write to if his official be not able to provide he with an answer will he ensure that the department establish precisely how many child in all our school across the whole country have have an acquire brain injury in the last five year do not know the hon gentleman constituency be so close to bournemouth as he suggest do not have the precise answer to that question will write to he language for life programme what step her department be take to accelerate the roll out of the language for life programme for nursery and pre school age child early language skill be vital for child to thrive that be why we carry out landmark early education reform invest up to million in training qualification and support and provide range of evidence base intervention from home learning to work with local health service there be grow evidence of how important it be to provide support for speech and language development in nursery and for preschool aged child programme such as language for life which be support by st john foundation in bath underpin the work that school be do to demonstrate how well they be do it the percentage of child need additional language support in school that participate reduce from to be sure the minister will want to congratulate the school and st john foundation on the work they be do but will the government prioritise speech and language programme such as language for life what the hon lady set out sound very encouraging and look forward to hear more about the language for life programme we have be very pleased with the finding of the government fund nuffield early language intervention which be different but have also focus on language development the neli have be find to help child to make four month additional development in their oral language skill and disadvantaged child to make seven month additional progress will the minister give we an update on this month delivery of the first phase of the free childcare entitlement and may urge he to ensure that we deliver phase on time in september be delighted to tell my right hon friend and the house that the first phase of the roll out go very well indeed some child be now benefit from the first stage of the roll out which labour members doubt could happen we have show again that we have plan while they have absolutely none school budgets since what assessment she have make of the impact of real term reduction to school budget since on school child be grateful to the hon lady for her question but be afraid there be flawed premise within it school funding be at billion the high it have ever be in real term per pupil there have be real term increase of per pupil nationally compare with thank the minister for his response but what he say about the state of school funding be not the full picture and he know it school cost have increase much fast than funding in fact analysis by the national education union show that every single school in nottingham east have less real term funding last year than year ago that be less per pupil on average if the government really care about the future of child and young people should they not be fund high quality education instead of whip up culture war we be fund high quality education and the quality of that education be see in the result be they the performance of year old in mathematic english and science or the result of primary school child which have improve dramatically since on the neu analysis be afraid that it be flawed in multiple respect it do not include number for the high need budget which have grow so much and ultimately it do not use real number for on the subject of school budget will the minister join in welcome the letter that receive from malvern college in worcestershire this week not only be that independent school one of the large employer in worcestershire but it contribute million to the local economy and if its plus fee pay pupil have to be educate in local school that would come at huge cost to the public purse my hon friend be exactly correct if the labour party get into government there would be hike in the cost of go to private school which would push number of family out of that provision we do not know how many labour do not know how many and nor do anybody else but we do know that some possibly very many would come into the state fund system cause great strain and possibly cut that would affect other child topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility with your permission mr speaker start by send our thought and prayer to the whole school and the community in ammanford in wales with exam season nearly upon we wish all our student and teacher the very good of luck over the come month we should be very proud of all the progress that our student and teacher have make with of school now rat good or from under labour in the internationally renowned programme for international student assessment our secondary school child have rocket up the ranking from and in the world for math and read under labour to and now the establishment of the education endowment foundation which have conduct nearly of all randomise control trial in education in the world be add to that success that fantastic progress be testament to the hard work of our school and the evidence base reform that we have undertake since on personal level may thank the secretary of state for sponsor my charity event yesterday for disabled child with of course welcome the government funding of new school place for child with special educational need but we need fair funding formula for those resource and we need furth billion just to prevent the crisis in special need from get bad so what step be the government take to ensure that funding be allocate accord to need not postcode thank my right hon friend who be do exceptional work to raise awareness of the impact of and have so far raise over to support vital research as he have point out we be invest record amount in special educational need and disability funding we review that funding and look at the formula every year it have go up by over the past five year to billion but be very happy to meet my right hon friend and look forward to do so we say we would have cup of tea to talk about this important topic and will get that date in the diary soon call the shadow secretary of state associate myself with the secretary of state comment and send my thought and good wish to all those in the school community of ammanford at this very difficult time the extension do not achieve its primary aim or demonstrate value for money that be damn line from the national audit office report into the government childcare expansion for month the secretary of state have tell parent and provider that they be wrong to be concern yet now we learn that even her own department consider delivery to be own failure expose why have she not listen and get serious plan in place or be she simply wait for labour to publish ours so that she can steal it laughter do not think anyone in the country be wait for labour to publish its plan this be serious because of course we be ambitious deliver the large expansion of childcare in our country history be not an easy task but that be the job of government and that be what we be do thank to the expansion over more child be get childcare support we be already deliver and have put that deliverability into three phase to make sure we continue to deliver we know what we need we need place we need workforce and we need the child but labour have absolutely no plan first labour members criticise our childcare model then they say they would scrap it and now they be say that it be not their job to have plan it be time for labour to stop talk down our childcare sector and commit to support our plan which be clearly work nonsense mr speaker what people right across this country want be general election and it can not come soon enough it be not only on childcare that the secretary of state be in total mess school leader teacher and staff have be dismay by her failure to reform ofsted she simply refuse to listen to staff to the education committee or indeed to parent be clear that under labour the day of one word judgment will come to an end so when can we expect the secretary of state to follow labour lead and commit to end ofsted headline grade we will not follow labour lead because in only of school be rat good or outstanding now thank to our reform and hard work that figure be up to we have already deliver number of change to improve the way ofsted carry out its inspection but the answer to these challenge be not to water down standard by abolish ofsted as labour have twice propose to do that accountability be one reason why of our school be good or from just under labour in the past year alone over more child be attend good or outstanding school because of the work that we do to improve standard and ofsted be an important part of that be power available to the secretary of state where school refuse to implement her guidance on social transitioning we expect that school will follow the guidance because it be guidance to help they carry out their exist statutory duty include safeguard if they do not take those guideline into account when deliver those duty they would be at risk of breach we now come to the snp spokesperson thank the secretary of state for mention exam season be sure she will include the scottish young people sit their exam whose exam start last week they be already in the throe of it deepfake image and nudification app pose massive threat to the mental health of girl in particular and therefore their educational outcome be pleased that the government have take step to criminalise the creation of such image but how be the secretary of state work with cabinet colleague to put pressure on internet company to take the radical action necessary to remove such image which can have such an impact on girl education the hon member be of course right that the lead be take by different department but we be very conscious of the pressure include from social medium in relation to pornography deepfake and nudification as she rightly identify and we be work right across government to make sure those pressure can be ease bear out feedback from my two excellent local conservative council recent report from the organisation london councils highlight drop in the number of pupil in school in hillingdon at time of fall number on roll in outer london will my hon friend commit to work with our school and local authority to promote the opportunity for more inclusion for send pupil in mainstream school my hon friend make two important point there be decline in the number of nought to four year old between and and we be provide million in this financial year to support school with manage that he be also right that although some child will always need special school place to have their need meet many can have their need meet in mainstream school through our send and alternative provision improvement plan we be make sure that school be inclusive and make that happen the secretary of state describe special educational need as lose lose lose when she be describe the process of parent appeal the judgment of education health and care plan which as say early often list school that be inadequate how do she expect parent to get the right school if they be not to appeal and who have break the system in the last year it be not like that before be actually refer to the fact that parent do not feel they be receive the good service from the system the school do not feel they be give the good service and the government feel they be spend lot more which be why it be very important that we get grip and fix the system of course we know that there have be massive increase in demand over the last few year not even year so we have have to put in place the special educational need and alternative provision improvement plan which be very thorough believe that the result of that plan will be win win win what step be the department take to make apprenticeship in build trade more attractive to young people and especially to woman and girl thank my hon friend for his question and for all of his work on this area know that he have be integral to the be housebuilder campaign to encourage more woman into the building sector our apprenticeship diversity champion network be support gender representation among employer and it be good news that stem start continue to increase year on year up in the last year but there be more to do and look forward to work closely with he on the issue the cass review have establish that social transitioning be not neutral act and that it introduce significant risk of harm do the secretary of state agree with that when new first minister emerge in scotland they should commit to factual science base education in school and implement the cass review finding in full so they do not suffer the same fate as their predecessor would encourage our friend and colleague in the scottish government whoever they may be at the time to pay close attention to hilary cass report think her work have inject some much need common sense into the debate and we be very grateful to she this government will always put the safety of our child first and that be why the gender question guidance we have produce in draft be underpin by the important principle of parent always be involve in decision about their child the liberal democrat run council in rutland have announce that it will close our specialist and outstanding rat send nursery the parks school this come with the further news that it be also go to close our only leisure centre the community be rightly devastate especially parent who want their child to get the good and most expert support do my hon friend agree that specialist provision must be protect and be absolutely vital and that the need for this kind of provision be only go to increase thank my hon friend who be absolutely right we have be hear negative thing about lib dem council from both side of the house this afternoon which sadly be not surprising she be absolutely right to be champion the need of those parent and child and hope the council will listen to her campaign and do the right thing there be no doubt but that this department have contribute to the chaos surround the opening of king leadership academy in my constituency parent and child find themselves in utter limbo and this debacle have cause extra pressure on school place across liverpool in reply to baroness barran provide absolutely no explanation of why it take the department until february to apply for planning permission despite have own the site since last summer when will this department get grip end the blame game and commit to exhaust every avenue in get the school open in september will look into the detail of the case and write to the hon lady research by london economics and the association of colleges highlight that in recent year there have be significant drop in level apprenticeship start will my hon friend the minister outline the specific work be carry out to reverse this decline in an area that be so vital in promote social mobility and level up at level and apprenticeship make up of all start so far this year and there be almost apprenticeship at level we publish datum last week to show that level apprenticeship rise by in term of attainment we will do everything we can to make sure people have access to high quality apprenticeship and we have also invest million over two year to boost start in growth sector include engineering and manufacturing be always happy to meet my hon friend five year on from the approval of new secondary school in my middlesbrough constituency not brick have be lay and the child of outwood academy riverside remain in an old home office block and the next two year intake be go to be bus to redcar to portacabin plonk on field child be spend their entire secondary school year in temporary accommodation and it be just not good enough will the secretary of state tell ministerial colleague to get grip and crack on with build the new school these student need and deserve we have increase the amount of money go into condition funding we be also of course rebuild school under the school rebuilding programme will look into the specific case the hon gentleman mention and come back to he my hon friend will be aware of my campaign to improve literacy across the country by improve child access to library in their school and community much can also be do by parent grandparent and carer in the year before child start school what be the department do to improve access to book and audiobook in particular as well as other literary material for pre school child my hon friend raise an excellent point reading be one of the most important thing child can be do at young age our little moments together campaign provide free resource for parent to encourage positive culture of read at home and we also fund the national literacy trust which do great work to promote reading can the minister give we an update on the school base work of the youth endowment fund on try to stop young people get involve in crime and can he tell we how the success of that work will be judge as it happen be meet the director of the youth endowment fund in the morning we have quarterly meeting to review progress and make sure it be on track in regard to the worrying topic raise early of antisemitism and islamophobia in school will minister please bear in mind section and of the education act the former ban political indoctrination in school and the latter say that when political subject be bring to the attention of pupil they must be present in fair and balanced way my right hon friend issue timely and important reminder and we be very clear on that with school we also of course part fund educate against hate which have material available and know that school also seek to go to length in most case to make sure that when tackle controversial current affair they be do so in an entirely impartial way while it be welcome that minister be finally invest in childcare the scheme just be not work with local provider tell it fall far short of what they need to meet demand exacerbate by the especially low rate pay in central bedfordshire will ministers change course to make sure that central bedfordshire family can finally access the childcare they need again the first stage of this roll out have go incredibly well with more than child now benefit labour mp should spend less time criticise our roll out and more in ask their front bench what their plan be because it be suppose to be like the creation of the nhs st francis school and heathfield school be two excellent special educational need school in fareham support variety of child with condition range from down syndrome to epilepsy but around the country there be child at independent special educational need school do my hon friend agree that labour misguided attack on independent school will be harmful and punitive to vulnerable child all around the country my right hon and learn friend be absolutely right this be policy to tickle the belly of the left of the labour party the opposition do not think it through and they be now go to whack family try to get the right support for their child with special educational need with more in fee in scottish student live away from home will be entitle to minimum of in student maintenance whereas english student live outside london will only be get minimum of give the current cost of living crisis which be undoubtedly factor in the withdrawal of almost undergraduate student in england last year will the government commit to provide the same encouragement and reinforcement to student in england as student in scotland enjoy we be try to deliver system that be fair not just to student but to taxpayer too that be why we be take action to support student with the cost of live in england include freeze tuition fee we have increase loan by and we have make sure that if someone family income fall by they can have their loan reassess it be also important that we support people from low income household which be why we have make furth million available include for hardship funding in this system be fair not just to student but to taxpayer more widely the sir robert pattinson academy in my constituency be great school provide an excellent education to child however it be struggle with the challenge of aged infrastructure and an urgent bid for it to rectify the heating and wiring challenge have be refuse an urgent meeting on friday with official be unproductive not least because the datum they be look at be out of date can ask the secretary of state to please ensure that the senior leadership team get an urgent meeting with senior official and that she personally ensure that this bid be look at properly and quickly will indeed do that my hon friend have bring up this subject with and with my right hon friend the secretary of state there be that meeting with mr hardy on friday know there be two separate case around the condition improvement fund bid and the urgent capital support bid we will continue to work with the school and will ensure that my hon friend get that high level meeting that she ask for among other cut the department for education have quietly slip out the announcement that it be slash funding for now teach which have support more than people to switch career and retrain as secondary teacher in shortage subject such as science math and modern language why on earth be the government withdraw funding when they be miss their teacher train target by in some of these subject and when now teach have have such brilliant track record in get people to retrain as teacher first must say that the statistic the hon lady just give on miss recruitment target be incorrect they be frequently repeat but not right we do think that career change be an important part of people come into this noble profession and we be continue with our career change programme we be not ax now teach we be not re procure it so we be not extend it again to put it in perspective it be roughly about to people in typical year out of about career change come into teaching we be reassess the good way to attract more of they because we want to grow the number of career change come into teaching and make sure that we go about it in the good and most productive way the secretary of state be well aware of the issue we have with academies enterprise trust and maltings academy in witham town she will know of the story of child miss out on school time because of exclusion and bullying some be even self harm what assurance can she give to pupil and their family who have very little choice as to which school they go to locally that their concern will be hear and that they will have great educational choice over which school their child go to know we have correspond on this recently and know my right hon friend be take close personal interest and have be involve directly and personally in multiple case in my most recent letter be not sure if it will have arrive yet have say that we will as department work with she thank the secretary of state and the shadow secretary of state for their comment about the incident at ysgol dyffryn aman in my constituency last week there be obviously now criminal investigation ongoing and charge of attempt murder so it would not be wise to speculate but as education be devolve in wales will the secretary of state pledge to work with the welsh government to ensure safety measure follow the various investigation have complete their work yes and can assure the hon gentleman that be always willing and ready to work with anyone from the devolved administration business those in manufacturing in particular speak about the challenge in fill vacancy the solution can often be in the exist workforce but old worker can be reluctant to take up apprenticeship what work be we do to encourage more old worker into the apprenticeship system work with employer be central to success on that point that be why we be deliver the local skill improvement plan to ensure that we be match the need of business and employer with the workforce they need we be work with over employer with over different occupation include on skill bootcamp which bring different demographic to the workforce to ensure that we have intensive training where industry have those skill need engagement with business be at the forefront of our mind on that point this weekend the times report that some conservative mp want to see graduate visa ban will the minister ask the home secretary to quash that damage rumour give that international student provide the uk with billion boost we be home to some of the world top university which benefit from strong international tie we think it be right to try to prevent any potential abuse and to protect the integrity of our high education system but it be true that international student make significant economic and cultural contribution to our education we believe it be possible to balance fair and robust migration policy with maintain our place as top destination for student from around the world thank the education secretary for all the support that her department be give to bracknell forest particularly the million safety valve programme and other sen initiative give the high number of good and outstanding school in bracknell and the focus on apprenticeship and level at bracknell and wokingham college might tempt she please to visit quick yes it be tempting we be proud of the safety valve programme which be be use across local authority and would love to see it in action as know it be provide lifeline to many council final question sir edward leigh for long weary year have be argue for an end of the faith cap which be prevent the opening of new catholic school and have no proper effect do the secretary of state think that should keep campaign and be patient for bit long have also have an opportunity to speak to my right hon friend on occasion about this the catholic church the church of england and other denomination play central part in our education typically have high quality school and typically be popular with parent we be keen to extend our academy and free school programme which have underpin the huge rise in quality and child result that we have see since no doubt before too long we may wish to put the two thing close together uk armed forces in middle east urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make statement on the role of the uk armed force in the middle east the prime minister and government ministers have regularly provide update in parliament on the recent role of the armed force in the middle east through write and oral statement in addition to respond to write question as have be say previously publicise operational activity to parliament in advance could undermine the effectiveness of operation and risk the life of armed force personnel involve the uk have provide assistance to our ally and partner in the region the ministry of defence have provide support to facilitate the foreign commonwealth and development office response to the deteriorate humanitarian situation in gaza and we continue to work with the fcdo our armed force personnel have play critical role in work to establish more route for vital humanitarian aid to reach the people of gaza and in the delivery of support in co ordination with the us and our international ally and partner to date the uk have conduct nine airdrop as part of the jordanian lead mission drop more than tonne of vital humanitarian aid of prepackaged halal meal water flour baby milk formula and rice to gaza uk military planner have be embed with the us operational team to jointly develop the safe and most effective maritime humanitarian aid route rfa cardigan bay be sail from cyprus to support the us pier initiative to enable the delivery of significantly more lifesaving aid into gaza the uk hydrographic office have also share analysis of the gazan shore with us planner to support the initiative the raf also send additional aircraft to the region to protect our ally and support de escalation culminate in the uk armed force shoot down number of iranian attack drone the house will understand that for operational security reason can not comment on the specific of that activity as state by the prime minister on april our aim be to support stability and security because that be right for the region and because although the middle east be thousand of mile away it have direct effect on our security and prosperity at home so we be work urgently with our ally to de escalate the situation and prevent further bloodshed official report april vol we be direct all our diplomatic effort to that end will not comment on media leak and speculation but can assure the house that the government be take all measure to support our ally and partner in the region we be press for sustainable ceasefire that will enable the release of hostage and provide the people of gaza with the essential assistance and humanitarian aid that they need welcome the minister back to the department in his new post of course the defence secretary should be here he have make only one oral statement on the middle east in more than two month as the minister say our uk armed force be reinforce regional stability protect international shipping defend partner country and deliver desperately need aid to gaza we be proud of their professionalism and across the house we pay tribute to their work but the agony of the palestinians in gaza be extreme child be starve family be die and famine and disease be take hold humanitarian help must flood into palestinian hand so we welcome the ninth raf airdrop last week but why have there be only one sea shipment of uk aid in more than six month and none this year what be the government do to open up ashdod port we welcome the new role for rfa cardigan bay in help to build the temporary pier the royal fleet auxiliary be demonstrate that it provide vital naval support be it protect from new civil service cut have ministers resolve the issue of the potential strike action what be the defence secretary do to raise rock bottom morale in the rfa weekend report suggest that uk troop could be deploy to deliver aid on the ground in gaza will the minister confirm those plan how will the defence secretary report to the house and ensure that parliament have say on any such deployment the defence secretary seem to be do the bare minimum on the diplomatic front why have he make only one visit to israel and the occupied palestinian territories since october we need an immediate ceasefire now hostage release now and unimpeded aid now we need political route to secure long term two state settlement where the government pursue these aim they will have labour full support be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question and his warm welcome he ask series of pertinent question which will seek to cover off he ask about our effort on maritime delivery clearly the deployment of rfa cardigan bay be lean into the prospect of far great flow of maritime aid through the cyprus humanitarian corridor which will seek to substantially uplift that deliver so far that will have an important impact on the extent to which ashdod can come into play we make the point regularly to our israeli colleague that open ashdod would be critical enabler of dramatically increase flow of aid which be seriously need the right hon gentleman ask about the royal fleet auxiliary cardigan bay colleague will have notice in last week statement to the house that there have be very substantial uplift in defence funding an additional billion over the next six year mean that morale across all three service and the royal fleet auxiliary will be resilient and high than before that uplift be vote of confidence in our capability of which we should all be proud certainly be will not comment on speculation that there might be ground role for uk force it would not be right for to comment on speculation we be very clear about the current remit rfa cardigan bay be there to provide living support for the us troop involve in the construction and operational delivery of the jlots joint logistic over the shore platform the defence secretary will as be his wo not continue to report frequently to this house and to make oral and write statement be very pleased to hear that the right hon gentleman would like to see the defence secretary at the dispatch box more often will relay that desire to he when see he he be busy man but he know that his first duty be to be in this house his visit to the occupied palestinian territories be important his be global role to categorise his one visit as disproportionate or lack of interest be uncharitable to say the least in all earnestness we share the right hon gentleman view that far great flow of aid and humanitarian support be contingent on sustainable ceasefire this house will know that we call on hamas to lay down their arm and release the hostage that be the sure route to find that sustainable ceasefire call the chair of the defence committee commend the government determination to get aid into gaza and commend the work of the raf rfa cardigan bay uk planner and the hydrographic office as the minister be aware would not expect he to comment on speculation but some of the well lay and well intentione plan can run into problem can he assure the house that we would only ever contemplate put uk boot on the pier if appropriate force protection be in place be grateful to the chair of the select committee who speak with characteristic expertise he be absolutely right that it would be improper for as government minister to comment on that speculation call the snp spokesperson can the minister confirm that the us maritime humanitarian aid corridor be require only because the israeli government will not allow the port of ashdod to be use to receive the appropriate amount of aid for northern gaza be the uk government content with that stranglehold over the people of gaza the working assumption be that nation will be drive truck of aid across this american facility but will that nation be the uk if it be what be the risk assessment if uk troop potentially step up for an operation that go where american troop fear to tread get aid into gaza to alleviate the unspeakable torment of the palestinians must be good thing and the professionalism and capability of uk troop be beyond question but be ministers seriously suggest that the good that euro atlantic ally can muster be british troop have ministers forget how british force operate in palestine in the arab rebellion of the palestinians have not any risk calculation must command more robust analysis rigour and humanitarian ambition not simply uk ministers ambition for positive headline well mr speaker that be mixed bag of question will answer in the spirit of sincere debate we should say that we be lean into the cypriot and jordanian humanitarian effort that be very important because those effort need to be ground in the region solution to the problem of the region lie in the region but clearly we have key enable role along with the us the hon gentleman invite to comment on speculation in the medium which will not do nor will dwell on his reference to the history lesson from we should be upbeat and proud of the way we have significantly lean into the delivery of humanitarian aid that be key component of stabilisation and of any prospect of peace in gaza call the chair of the intelligence and security committee one of the main strategic aim of iran russia ally in support what hamas do in october last year be to suck western power into the middle eastern theatre thereby divert they from russia existential conflict with ukraine may urge the minister not to comment on the suggestion that we might have british boot on the ground in the gaza strip but to take the message back to the secretary of state that this would be completely insane idea it would be far well to have moderate neighbour arab state deal with any distribution of aid that we have facilitate as result of the viable raf and sea power that we have rightly exercise my right hon friend be right the answer to the humanitarian and political challenge in the region lie within the region entirely agree with his analysis he make relevant and good point about the requirement for we to maintain focus on our effort to support our ukrainian friend in defend their sovereignty that be why last week we announce an additional uplift in our annual support for ukraine to the tune of million bring this year support to billion record amount from our work on the defence committee know that the armed force be run hot obviously the event in the middle east over the last six month or so have put much great strain and pressure on our armed force what be the minister do to ensure that our armed force get proper rest and recuperation and that we improve the resilience of our asset we be increase funding for defence to record level which increase the armed force capacity to train rest and attend to all the area of their life other than operation that be huge vote of confidence in the esprit de corps of our armed force we be take defence investment to of gdp by it be tremendous boost which will filter down and improve retention and effectiveness right across the board be in israel early this year and meet senior israel defence forces personnel who assure that they be do everything in their power and be work with ally to increase aid to gaza it be the right thing to do and we must continue those effort but it be patent that hamas be obstruct the distribution of aid within gaza another reason why we need to support israel in defeat hamas will the minister assure the house that if and when israel go into rafah where several hamas battalion remain and where senior hamas operative and the hostage be base uk support will remain resolute and steadfast as we support israel in finish the job and eliminate hamas we be clear eyed in our assessment of hamas we regard they as terrorist organisation that have prosecute an atrocity we call on they to lay down their arm and to release the hostage that be the precondition for any kind of meaningful and sustainable ceasefire the government have so far resist have proper debate and vote on british military engagement in the middle east this year the engagement of the british army in bosnia in the start out as be for the purpose of humanitarian aid but be subject to mission creep as british soldier be attack by the war party in john reid say we would be perfectly happy to leave in three year time without fire one shot will the minister assure we that if the government propose use british troop on the ground in gaza they would first grant this house debate and vote on the matter the lesson of bosnia be interesting and be not lose on government members the hon gentleman should have no doubt that ministers and the government will remain fully accountable to this house may declare an interest member of my close family have be and be involve in military operation in the middle east bear in mind my experience in northern ireland seven tour be slightly worried that if our armed force open fire in the middle east which they have do foreign country will at some future date put they before an international court and charge they hope the minister will declare that such thing will never happen be grateful to the right hon and gallant gentleman for his question he speak from position of knowledge he should be assure as should the house that our force in the region operate with the full force of the law behind they on the basis of collective self defence israeli medium be report that the international criminal court could be about to issue an arrest warrant for benjamin netanyahu and other top israeli official for the litany of war crime commit by israel in gaza it be far report that the united states government be work to prevent justice from be do and to stop the icc issue arrest warrant do the minister agree after more than palestinians woman man and child have be slaughter in gaza and israeli bombing have obliterate and decimate entire palestinian neighbourhood that benjamin netanyahu should be hold to account for his horrific crime rise order we have to be careful the question be quite frame be sure the minister might want to pick part of that to answer yes regard that as out of scope no think do that anyway call robert jenrick hamas be terrorist organisation that hate the united kingdom and everything that we stand for it would therefore be deeply unwise for the uk to commit british serviceman and woman whether on the ground or on the pier in gaza it be for precisely that reason that the white house have categorically rule this out will the minister take the opportunity to do the same so that we can reassure our constituent that we do not make an inadvertent mistake and that british troop will continue do what they should be do which be facilitate the complete eradication of hamas agree entirely with my right hon friend analysis and his comment about hamas other than that of course will not comment on speculation in the medium what discussion have the minister have regard un security force accompany truck to enable they to move into gaza in the light of the impediment they be face and also rebuild infrastructure so that truck can travel across the country to deliver crucial medical and other humanitarian aid great deal of energy from ministers and official be go into the ongoing discussion about how to operationalise the great flow rate of humanitarian aid go into gaza so the hon lady ask relevant question the minister be rightly reluctant to discuss the role disposition and location of british force in the middle east but could he again confirm to the house that the requisite force protection will be factor into all operational level planning and also that it be not beyond the realm of possibility that the un could be coerce into take more active role in gaza my hon friend also ask relevant question and can give he that assurance in relation to the deployment of rfa cardigan bay some people be already dead in gaza many be die now in rafah from wholly preventable condition such as measle because of lack of sanitation and medical care and the israeli bombardment be still go on that be the big problem for get aid in what pressure be the minister put on the israeli government to cease the bombardment of gaza to ensure the withdrawal of israeli force from gaza and to ensure that we will not be deploy british troop anywhere on the on the ground in gaza the west bank or any other part of the region and that instead we will search for peace and for justice for the people of palestine the right hon gentleman ask about the protection of civilian we continue to make the point to our israeli friend that they must seek to protect civilian life but of course the root cause of this be the atrocity commit by hamas for peace to be secure all that would have to happen be for hamas to lay down their arm and release the hostage iran continue to present one of the most pressing and dangerous threat to the middle east and to global stability with the increase emphasis on the need for an integrated defence strategy comprise different nation of the region do my hon friend agree that there be an ongoing vital role for british force to play as they do so ably on the night of and april wholeheartedly agree and we should pay tribute to those who courageously play an active role in that defence of our collective security undoubtedly british armed force have sustained and hugely important role to play in bring peace and stability right across the region the un report that of all those in the world face imminent famine be locate in gaza with over humanitarian worker kill by israeli force since october ceasefire be essential for the effective delivery of aid and for prevent famine in both the short term and the long term how can the government justify their continue refusal to back call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire the hon lady be correct that ceasefire be need as it be the way to assure the flow of aid that gazans need the precondition of that ceasefire be for hamas to lay down their arm and to release the hostage be in israel on the night of the iran attack and see the jet in the sky david sling and iron dome deal with the ballistic missile as they come in feel very proud to know that our force be involve and the israelis be very grateful for our activity one group of people in gaza who be not be provide with aid or proper medical check be of course the hostage last monday speak to the parent of year old hersh goldberg polin who be last see on october be bundle into the back of truck with his arm and hand missing have have grenade throw into his shelter video be release on wednesday and it be the first sight of he he look in very distressed state can the minister assure that we will continue to do everything we can militarily and through intelligence to help israel to locate these hostage can of course give my hon friend that assurance it be highly sensitive subject and if he would care to raise the case with individually we will do what we can to follow up two month ago the house pass labour motion call for an immediate ceasefire we believe that hamas must immediately release their hostage but israel must also look at release its prisoner there have to be an immediate and unimpeded supply of aid into gaza but be really concerned about uk force get involve we should rely absolutely on aid be deliver by the charity and voluntary organisation on the ground what be the defence secretary do with our ally and regional partner to secure an immediate ceasefire we continue to make the point that hamas must lay down their arm and release the hostage that be the precondition for peace the key problem as my hon friend will know be that hamas and islamic jihad be appropriate aid mean for the palestinians what step be our armed force take to ensure that aid get to those who really need it not the terrorist network what step be they take against hamas terrorist tunnel under the egyptian border british armed force could play significant role in work with israel to dismantle the tunnel network my right hon friend ask very good question and huge amount of effort be go into this we be energetically lean into the prospect of great degree of aid flow through the cypriot and jordanian humanitarian corridor and the jlots temporary pier capability could be an absolute game changer the government continue to provide huge sum of taxpayer money for arm and weapon for ukraine but minimal funding for humanitarian aid for gaza do the minister believe that the uk public share the government spend priority believe they do yes despite some positive noise come out of the middle east about truce for my constituent in bolton it be deeply worry to see report of an increasingly likely ground offensive in the southern city of rafah the minister speak about not want to see any more bloodshed but if there be ground offensive more blood will be shed what be our government the ministry of defence in particular do to avoid bloodshed happen in rafah and to prepare for different scenario we always make the point to our israeli colleague that the protection of civilian life be imperative we acknowledge that israel have an absolute right to self defence and we hope that hamas will recognise that the path to peace lie in lay down their arm and release the hostage my understanding be that the british government do not support the ground offensive by the israeli military in rafah will they therefore use all the leverage at their disposal include withdraw arm export licence if the israeli government act against british policy we have one of the world tough arm export regime of which we should be very proud on the middle east it be decade since this house vote to support the uk join the global coalition against daesh although territory have be liberate do not the recent strike by the raf against rocket launcher be use to target coalition force underline the need for sustained long term commitment to defeat and destroy terrorism my hon friend be absolutely right about that and we should be grateful for the role play by the raf it be reminder that the price of peace be eternal vigilance thank the minister for his response very much welcome the prime minister announcement last week about the extra defence spending it be important that we support innocent victim who can not protect themselves the uk role in the middle east be much appreciated acclaimed and respected do the minister agree that in response to recent increase iranian threat for instance with the islamic revolutionary guard corps be responsible for hamas terrorist attack across gaza and the broad middle east we must do whatever we can within our budget to encourage de escalation and to try to prevent further attack by iran and its supporter agree with the hon gentleman he rightly say that put in of gdp by will provide that boost and ensure that we have the operational capability to achieve that global response that we need to keep our country safe we talk about truck day because that be the pre war number but that be when gaza have relatively function economy and an agricultural sector to back it up therefore more than truck will be need by land and sea and so thank the armed force for their help in deliver aid and in help to build the pier what pressure be we put on israel to get more aid quickly deliver by land which be the good and quick way of do it and on the use of unrwa in northern gaza as it have the most effective system to get aid to the right place quickly my hon friend be correct we do need to increase that flow what would be game changer be open the port of ashdod and we continue to make that point forcefully to our colleague do my hon friend agree that his majesty armed force could be provide any humanitarian support now or in the future only with israel total co operation and that it should be recognise for that have he note also that israel iron dome and arrow defensive system among other thing would in effect be part of the protection of his majesty and other ally force do he agree that that make even more nonsense of the anti israel interest call for an arm embargo against israel because if ally force include his majesty force be to be act in the region they would be look for support from israel itself my right hon and learn friend make very good point check on goods entering uk urgent question to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if he will make statement on the introduction of check on good enter the uk under the border target operating model due to be live on april under the border target operating model tomorrow the government be introduce documentary and risk base identity and physical check on medium risk animal product plant plant product and high risk food and feed of non animal origin import from the eu check on high risk product currently conduct at destination be move from destination to border control post and control point recent medium report suggest that the introduction of these control will be delay be incorrect documentary check will happen at all risk level physical check will initially focus on the high risk good with some also take place on medium risk commodity we will build up to full check rate to both protect biosecurity and minimise disruption we will continually review our enforcement approach as we track compliance and trade flow and will adjust our approach accordingly this pragmatic approach will support trader as they adjust to the new regime the government have work closely with industry inspection agency and the animal and plant health agency know as apha to ensure we be ready for the introduction of these control we be confident that border control post infrastructure have sufficient capacity and capability to handle the volume of check expect under the border target operating model we be confident that our system be robust dynamic and effective and that the inspection authority be appropriately staff and train close by emphasise that the introduction of these biosecurity control be not optional now that we have move away from the eu rigid biosecurity surveillance and reporting system we be responsible for protect our own biosecurity against threat such as african swine fever let we start by say this be not about brexit because whether member support or oppose brexit nothing propose here be inevitable or unavoidable have leave the eu we need border control but what be propose will not be control it will be chaos the eu bring in check in but this government have delay do that five time in that time they could have negotiate sanitary and phytosanitary deal to avoid the mess that be about to happen instead from wednesday for the first time million lorry will need to be stop at dover so their content can be check and another million will require health certificate for the animal product they carry on top of that million of they will have to pay common user charge for the privilege of import good deem medium or high risk whether or not they be inspect the cost to business which we know will be pass on to consumer be horrendous and chaotic and the charge be confirm only on april the government have admit that the check will cause inflation but they claim it be only three year independent analysis show it will be time that amount or month on the average food shop if the minister want to dispute that figure will he finally publish the modelling that the government have refuse to disclose so we can see how they have come to their number we know their number be wrong because while they have confirm that the common user charge the direct cost to each lorry will be about time they admit they have not calculate how much the new veterinary check will cost with some run to hundred of pound they can not make those calculation because they tell european country to set their own standard and charge so how can minister tell we we can be confident when we do not know what will be pass to be healthy in hungary germany or here if food standard matter to people they will be disappoint because the minister have just admit that only some check will happen on medium risk good from wednesday will he put number on how many check will happen from wednesday medium risk good be anything of animal origin that be not alive but could also be beetroot or sweetcorn what mess small business be go to be clobber for fee for service they will not even get on top of that sevington have not even be declare border control post to carry out any of the check where will good come into dover be check on wednesday especially if they be high risk what about the other port around the uk that can set their own charge and who be go to enforce any of this the government tell industry to be prepare but there will not be any check after pm so people can say goodbye to those just in time supply chain for perishable good people come back from holiday have no idea what their personal use be so they could be stop for carry gorgonzola with hour to go we need some straight answer our constituent can not eat the paperwork or afford the price rise these check will create corner shop deli and restaurant will go bust and our port will be bung up say to the minister that there be still time to cancel the brexit border tax so will he please listen to concern from across the house and do so the hon lady either choose not to understand what be happen or deliberately try to inflame situation that will be of great benefit to the uk move forward she deliberately pick the high figure available for low risk good there be charge for product cap at maximum of five product so the maximum amount that can be charge on lorry load of low risk good would be the hon lady be right that we have calculate that over three year that will lead to an additional on food inflation in comparison an outbreak of foot and mouth disease cost this country billion not take into account the impact on international trade and our reputation as country so these check be small price to pay for ensure we be safe and protect for phytosanitary and sanitary good come into the uk call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee obviously as part of the european union and the single market we could not impose check to ensure that disease such as african swine fever do not come into the country the minister have say that there will be graduated approach to the introduction of the check what be the timescale for ramp they up to level that he believe will be satisfactory if consignment be divert to sevington what measure will be in place to ensure that those truck or van actually arrive at sevington and people do not dump what be on board in layby or transfer it to another vehicle thank my right hon friend for his question and for the scrutiny that his select committee have undertake it be important to distinguish between those good that come into the country through approve route via approve importer on traditional line and those people who may seek to import good into the uk illegally or without that documentation there will still be border control check by border force at the port of dover to catch those who be try to do something illegal but those who be operate within the system will move to sevington to stop halfway and avoid those check would be criminal act and those good would not be able to be sell within the uk marketplace call the shadow minister we recognise the need to ensure the uk biosecurity but echo the point make by my hon friend the member for walthamstow stella creasy what mess it be april and the new check be be introduce tomorrow but the business involve be unclear about how the system be suppose to operate and that be after the five delay that we have hear about and huge sum waste on border control point perhaps the minister can tell we how much have be waste on portsmouth for instance we want these check to work have be to the london and the dover port health authority and be extremely impressed by the work that they do but it be baffle that in the battle against asian swine flu at dover the minister be take away vital funding as the government move the check mile up the road to sevington can he tell the house how food vehicle will be control on that journey as dover port health authority tell clearly that they will the government have admit that the cost will be an extra million annually other say it will be more what definitive figure can the minister provide for the inflationary impact that this government border measure will create for food supply in the uk what assessment have be make of the saving and efficiency that would be make if we be to achieve well veterinary agreement with the eu in conclusion the british chamber of commerce say that defra have fail to listen to industry over these change other say the same many business be exasperate by the endless delay and the repeat and continual lack of clarity and certainty in the implementation of the new system why have the government leave business and even border chief in position where they simply can not plan properly and be leave in the dark as one put it at one minute to midnight in term of be tell about the essential feature of the new system what be the minister go to do to sort out the mess thank the shadow minister for his question and his interest in this topic what be clear be that there be distinction between those good that be come into the country illegally which will still be inspect at the port of dover by border force and those that be come in via legitimate route by legitimate trade link from area that have be inspect by their own country equivalent of the food standards agency to make sure that those port good be safe to come into the uk with the correct documentation those good will go to sevington but if someone try to do something illegal they will be pick up by border force at the port of dover via inspection include intelligence lead inspection interruption the shadow minister say that there be no money but we be in conversation with port of dover to resolve that the other challenge that the shadow minister put to we be that we have delay this number of time that have happen because we have be in conversation with those people and haulier who have have comment on how to improve the system we have listen to those concern and now have the model that will operate give the advice and liaison we have have with those company as veterinary surgeon be passionate about biosecurity be reassure that our conservative government be take this matter very seriously indeed thank the animal and plant health agency and everyone at our border who do so much in this regard prior to leave the eu we do not have the opportunity systematically to check animal and plant product come into the uk do my right hon friend agree that we now have the opportunity to strengthen our biosecurity and that the introduction of the border target operator model will protect animal plant and ultimately human health in the uk move forward pay tribute to my hon friend for his work in this area and his expertise in it move forward we will be in much strong place in term of our phytosanitary and sanitary protection that be the right outcome we will continue to ensure that we be safe in the uk and that we protect our border proportionately call the snp spokesperson the continual uncertainty be cause by these border check be not only disgraceful but highly damaging for industry and consumer there have be five delay by the uk government accompany by complete failure to communicate those delay effectively do the minister accept that the significant disruption be face be symptom of not only the government disastrous delivery of the check but brexit itself any suggestion to the contrary be frankly for the bird secondly will he apologise from the dispatch box to the business that have be diligently prepare for the change only to be leave utterly in the dark by his government the hon gentleman characterisation be simply untrue we have be work closely with the sector with haulier and with company that want to import food into the uk we be approach this in pragmatic proportionate way we have take our time to get it right do not apologise for take time to ensure that the system that we will introduce tomorrow be proportionate and pragmatic we have listen to the company that will use the system to ensure that we get it right and it work we be ramp this up at pace that be slow but steady to ensure that we get to the right place in the right time to keep the country safe from any disease my right hon friend make the point that there have be delay and he make no apology for they give those delay will he accept my assurance since sevington be in my constituency that the team work there whom have speak to about this in great detail be absolutely prepared and well train to do the check as well as they could possibly be do people can be assure of the safety of import check at sevington because the team there be absolutely across everything that need to be do be grateful to my right hon friend for his support and the reassurance that he give the house we will continue to listen and to work with those who want to import good into the uk to ensure that we remove as many barrier to the operation of free trade as possible but at the same time keep ourselves safe our trade intensity have fall to the low level in the and itv joel hills have state that the estimate cost of the new model be time the government estimate hope that the department will publish its detailed working soon but surely the bottom line be that the cost of living crisis have not go away and the minister be basically introduce system that will cost uk consumer more to check on import come from the eu to standard that be exactly the same as the uk and which of course meet eu standard in the first place do he seriously think that voter will forgive he the right hon gentleman say that there will be extensive cost as say for low risk product they be per product limit to maximum of five product per common health entry document that mean that the cost be reasonable we calculate that there will be increase in cost over three year he say that these good be come from within the eu under the same regulation african swine fever be move across europe it be already present in italy be that disease to get to the uk it would be devastating for the uk pork market and the uk pig population it would also damage our ability to export pork product around the world if we lose our credibility as be free from african swine fever the minister be absolutely right about the devastating impact of not have proper check and the risk of african swine fever so can he explain why dover port health be have its cost slash for essential check at the border will he accept that the exist check should be maintain in full at dover port health that dover port of be the right authority with its state of the art facility to do these important check in respect of which it be the most experienced body across the entire channel and that we should not risk have these check at some new untested supposedly train facility mile away in ashford that be risk to this country pay tribute to my hon friend tenacious campaign on behalf of her constituent and the port of dover but hope she will not mind my draw attention to the fact that these be separate regime good come in legally via legal channel with the right documentation will move to sevington but the port of dover be the right place for border force to ensure that we be protect from illegal import and those check will still take place the conversation with the port of dover over funding continue and we want to see port of dover continue to help to keep we safe and intercept any illegal import that people may attempt to bring into the uk those of we from rural community particularly those like mine in cumbria that have to live through the horror of the foot and mouth outbreak in know how vital it be to have biosecurity at our border but intelligently apply so that we do not damage supply chain and have excessive red tape do this issue not shine spotlight on the fact that we be now sadly increasingly reliant on food import britain produce only of the food we eat do that not remind we that the government agricultural payment scheme which actively disincentivise the production of food on good quality productive agricultural land be extremely foolish and should be reverse if we be serious about our security as country be familiar with the beauty of the hon gentleman constituency as he know be there on saturday with the shadow minister he give the figure for what we import in total but for the food we can produce we be at the prime minister have also recognise that challenge and we will introduce food security index so that we can monitor this issue to make sure that the government policy do drive farmer to increase their productivity and their production have full confidence in the ability of our farmer to continue to produce top quality british food to continue to expand their productivity and to keep the country well feed these change be require under world trade organisation rule and be about keep we safe from disease threat but in practical term how will it work for mixed load in particular to reduce the cost to business and therefore to consumer my hon friend ask an important question that be why we have cap the maximum charge to five per load particularly to support sme as say for those of medium risk the charge be or maximum of per load that cap be specifically aim at help and support sme that be import food into the uk what do the government have against the billion floristry industry in this country which employ people seven time as many dentist as we have in this country many of they work in small family business on very small margin why do the government do absolutely no impact assessment when they increase the cost for those bring in chrysanthemum dianthus solidago orchid and gypsophila to and introduce severe delay on product that need to be at market by in the morning wedding funeral mother day and valentine day be there any family event that will not feel the dead hand of this government the hon gentleman be right to highlight how important that sector be to the uk economy that be why we want to protect those grow flower here in the uk from any disease that may be import via product that have not come through the right channel with the right documentation we want to keep the grow sector in the uk safe from any of those disease that be why we be introduce these check the border operating model will not apply on trade between northern ireland and great britain those trade route be exempt however give the record of dodgy product be manufacture in the irish republic and bring through northern ireland to gb can the minister give an assurance that should that route be use either by republic of ireland producer or other eu producer he will not be instal check on northern ireland to gb trade which be so important to the northern ireland food industry and economy of course we recognise the importance of the northern ireland economy and we want to ensure that northern ireland feel part of the united kingdom we will do everything we can to limit any impact as the right hon gentleman identifie there be currently no timescale for the introduction of the way in which we will monitor and work with those who be move good across from that part of the united kingdom we want to ensure that that do not become back door route and we will continue to have conversation with the authority in that part of the world on the subject of back door route can my right hon friend tell we when the border control point for the welsh port that connect to the eu through the republic of ireland will be operational can not give my right hon friend date at this moment in time but we be in detailed conversation particularly with those at the port of holyhead which be an important uk port and as soon as we have date will update he from the dispatch box the minister say that this policy will benefit britain but the centre for economic performance say that our food price be already high because of brexit and independent analysis show that the government approach will cost another billion why be he ignore british business estimate on this issue and hit british customer with another tory tax at this difficult time as the hon gentleman will be aware from my previous answer we be work hard to ensure that we keep uk food producer free from plant and animal disease that be why we be introduce these check in proportionate way that do not impact on business it be why we have limit the amount of charge that can be introduce to five per lorryload it be why we have ensure that those fee be set at only for medium risk product and it be why we will continue to work with industry to ensure that we have proportionate approach that do not take cash away from business and only recover the cost of keep we safe as country why have the government refuse to implement tonnage base approach as the eu do which would support small and medium sized importer particularly in wellingborough not do so risk put they out of business to avoid that will the minister adopt measure such as ensure that all small and medium sized importer can join the trust trader scheme we do look at different model of course we could have adopt the model of third country to the eu but that would have create significant cost for those wish to import food across the channel we also look at adopt the eu model which again would have cost way more than the model that we be introduce the model that we be roll out tomorrow be the good and most pragmatic model that we have be able to develop through work with and listen to the advice of those in the sector food price be high than they be three year ago and independent estimate reckon that new border check be equivalent to add tariff to import what assessment have the minister make of the impact that border check will have on living standard in welsh household in which one in every four adult have be skip meal to make end meet actually on increase food price in wales the big danger be take of land away from welsh farmer and out of production and impose top down approach to those farmer hope that the right hon lady will rethink her support for the welsh government disastrous proposal which will drive thousand and thousand of people out of welsh agriculture as direct result of all these change small business will close job will be lose and consumer choice will be reduce that be the exact opposite of what brexit be suppose to achieve be it not do not accept the hon gentleman characterisation this be pragmatic approach to keep the country safe from animal and plant disease while allow the free flow of trade via model in which people can get certification away from the port to ensure that they can import product and stamp down on those who want to act illegally obviously these control will introduce additional logistical step which be problematic for time critical product recently meet people from maincrop potatoes ltd in my constituency it trade potato to producer so it have deadline to hit on those production line and it will be import more this year because of the disastrous potato harvest can the minister provide any reassurance that that process will be streamline enough to enable that business to continue to move its good around in timely way draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests what the hon lady have describe be exactly what we want to try to achieve make sure that trade particularly in good such as potato flow across the channel as freely as possible but that we protect ourselves from disease such as brown rot that could be devastating to the uk potato production could the minister set out the government current policy towards comprehensive uk eu veterinary agreement and what negotiation if any be happen in that regard that would surely be huge win for consumer and producer right across the uk and would have the add bonus of far reduce the level of check require on agrifood movement across the irish sea do not think that if we be to reach that agreement it would include veterinary medicine but of course we continue to have conversation with our friend in the eu to remove as many barrier as possible we have strong interest in make sure that the farmer and vet in northern ireland continue to get adequate supply of medicine and we will work with our friend in the eu to unblock as many of those barrier as possible my understanding be that the minister be oppose to brexit in and presume one of the reason for that be that he oppose red tape do this measure and other not indicate that as fear brexit be turn into the big chapter of red tape in uk economic history be strong believer in democracy the brexit debate be one that be settle by the great british public they vote to leave the european union and now want to embrace the opportunity that that bring for the uk as government we will continue to work tirelessly to make sure that we make brexit work for the uk and seize those opportunity that come our way be now go to have to suspend the house suggest that we suspend for minute in order to allow the front benchers to read the statement sitting suspend health and disability reform pm order the sitting be now resume the reason for the suspension be because the statement which under the ministerial code should have be deliver at minimum of minute prior to the statement be make be deliver late know the secretary of state will want to look into the matter and report back to the speaker first may apologise profusely to the house that copy of my statement be not provide to mr speaker and indeed those on the opposition front benches sufficiently in advance of my statement may also take this as my first opportunity in the house to say how saddened be by the passing of frank field true champion of welfare reform who be always prepared to work across party while we do not always agree on all matter share and admire his belief that welfare mean transform life with permission mr deputy speaker shall make statement on the consultation we be launch today on the change to the personal independence payment which aim to create benefit system that can well support disabled people and people with long term health condition to live full and independent life this government priority be to make sure that our welfare system be fair and compassionate fair on the taxpayer by ensure that people of working age who can work do work and fair on those in most need of the state help welfare at its good be about more than just benefit payment it be about change life for the well in recent year the government have deliver successive reform to create system that be fair and more compassionate while provide value for the taxpayer we have reform an outdated and complex legacy benefit system and introduce universal credit new modern benefit that ensure people be well off in work than on benefit last year we publish landmark white paper announce significant reform to focus the welfare system on what people can do rather than what they can not we be deliver our billion back to work plan substantially expand the employment support to help more disabled people and people with health condition to start stay and succeed in work our reform to the work capability assessment will well reflect the opportunity in the modern world of work and ensure that more people get the support they need to move into employment while protect those unable to work and in february we publish the disability action plan to make this country the most accessible place in the world for people to live work and thrive in addition the government have provide unprecedented help for the most vulnerable include by implement one of the large cost of live support package in europe which prevent million people from fall into absolute poverty during time of global inflationary pressure we have increase benefit by and raise the local housing allowance benefit million household by an average of around this year our approach to transform the benefit system for disabled people and people with long term health condition be guide by three important priority provide the right support to the people who need it most target our resource most effectively and support disabled people to reach their full potential and to live independently although we have make significant progress the disability benefit system for adult of working age be not consistently provide support in the way that be intend it have be more than decade since the introduction of the personal independence payment the intention be that it would be more sustainable more dynamic benefit that would provide well target support to help disabled people with the extra cost arise from their disability however the nature and understanding of disability and ill health in britain have change profoundly since then and the clinical case mix have evolve in line with those broad change include many more people apply for disability benefit with mental health and neurodivergent condition since the proportion of the caseload receive the high rate of pip have increase from to some of working age people in england and wales be now claim pip or disability living allowance which be forecast to rise to by in the government spend billion on extra cost disability benefit for people of work age in england and wales and the office for budget responsibility have forecast that the cost will rise to billion in nominal term by there be now more than new award for pip per month that figure have almost double since the pandemic with almost quarter of the adult population now report disability up from in believe that now be the time for new conversation about how the benefit system can well support people to live full and independent life today be launch consultation to explore change that could be make to the current pip system to ensure that support be focus where it be most need these option include make change to eligibility criterion for pip redesign the pip assessment to well target it towards the individual need of disabled people and people with health condition include explore whether people with specific health condition or disability can be take out of pip assessment all together and reform the pip assessment so that it be more link to person condition we be also consult on whether we should make fundamental change to how we provide support to disabled people and people with health condition we know that any additional cost arise from disability or health condition which pip be intend to help with can vary significantly and be unique to the individual circumstance some people on pip may have relatively small one off cost such as walk aid or aid to help with eating and drinking or ongoing additional cost relate to their disability or health condition such as help around the home or run ventilator some claimant cost will be fully cover by their award while other may find the current system do not provide enough support to meet their need yet the current system operate one size fit all model and do not channel people towards bespoke support tailor to an individual need we recognise that well more targeted support could be provide by other local service our plan include explore how the welfare system could be improve with new approach to provide support such as move away from fix cash benefit system so that people can receive more tailored support in line with their need explore how to well align the support pip offer with exist service and offer of support available to disabled people and people with health condition and explore alternative way of support people to live independent and fulfilling life which could mean financial support be well target at people who have specific extra cost but could also involve improve support of other kind such as respite care or physical or mental health treatment aim to achieve well outcome for individual crucially we want to explore whether we can achieve our aim within the current structure of health and disability benefit or whether wide change be need we be consult over the next week to seek view from across society include disabled people and representative organisation to ensure that everyone have chance to shape welfare reform that will modernise the support provide through the benefit system we know that these reform be significant in their scale and ambition but we will not shy away from the challenge face our welfare system today we owe that to the million of people who rely on it and to the hard work people whose taxis underpin it that be what the next generation of welfare reform be all about these proposal will help to create benefit system that can well support disabled people and people with long term health condition to live full and independent life and they be crucial part of my mission to ensure that the welfare system be fair and compassionate and that it provide the right help to those who need it most commend this statement to the house thank the secretary of state for his comment about frank field both and my hon friend the member for wallasey dame angela eagle who be sit alongside on the front bench think the world of frank thank the secretary of state for his tribute to person who be completely unique in every way with regard to advance sight of the secretary of state statement say apology accept labour will carefully review the detail of the green paper because the country that we want be one where disabled people have the same right to good job and help to get it as anyone else we will judge any measure that the government bring forward on its merit and against that principle because the cost of failure in this area be unsustainable the autonomy and routine of work be good for we all for our mental and physical health and more than that for woman work be freedom too have read the secretary of state gibe about labour he say that he do not know what our position be on set of reform that he have not set out the prime minister make speech about this issue two week ago but every single day since then the government have fail to publish the green paper the secretary of state want my view on his until this moment unpublished thought what be the problem be the printer jam rather be it that the prime minister and secretary of state realise that as soon as they publish the green paper everyone would realise the truth about the government like the prime minister who lead they they be long on question and short when it come to the answer the green paper be not plan it be an exam that the secretary of state be hop he will never have to sit the reason he want to know labour plan be that he suspect he will be long go before any of these proposal be reality will the secretary of state tell where the green paper leave the government early half bake plan to scrap the work capability assessment give that the idea behind that be to use the pip assessment he say that some health condition can be take out of pip assessment which condition be he talk about pip be the creation of conservative government so where be the analysis of what have go wrong pip replace dla and now we be hear that pip be the problem how many more time will we go around this same roundabout do the government plan involve treat people mental and physical health differently can he explain the legal basis for do so importantly on health itself be this green paper not huge admission of the tory failure on the nhs in that it take as its starting point the fact that people today simply can not get the treatment and care they need what will the cost of any new system be in particular those of any extra support of the kind he mention will we see white paper before general election be stand in today and for the next few week for my hon friend the member for leicester west liz kendall who believe that health and work be two side of the same coin that be the insight that the government be miss today ask myself how we get here the country today be sicker that be the legacy of this government nhs waiting list be long than they have ever be that be the legacy of the secretary of state party if he do not know how bad thing be in mental healthcare he need only to ask my hon friend the member for central suffolk and north ipswich dr poulter there be million people who be lock out of work due to long term sickness that be the conservative legacy like ice on our potholed road the tories have widen the crack in our economy and society make they all much bad with respect to mental health in recent week the secretary of state have decide to speak out of both side of his mouth on the one hand he say grateful for today much more open approach to mental health but with the same breath he go on to say there be danger that this have go too far he want it both way he think that openness about mental health be good but then he say the very thing that bring back the stigma every time the secretary of state speak he make it less likely that people will be open about their mental health on behalf of all of we who have ever have panic attack at work or bad can say that that stigma stop people from get treatment it make get help hard and it keep people out of work not in it labour government will take totally different approach we will not only ensure more appointment but have an extra mental health staff the last labour government deliver the high patient satisfaction on record and that be the record on which we will build the issue that we be discuss be big than just health it be also about work because of our commitment to serve work people we will make work well too we will have the new deal for work people improve right for the first time in generation and we will drive up employment in every region because we will devolve employment support and end the tick box culture in jobcentre we will tear down the barrier to work for disabled people and provide help for young people that will get britain work again harold wilson say that unemployment above all else make he political those of we who grow up see people throw on the scrapheap in the and feel the same every young person out of work today will never forget whose hand be on the tiller when these tories rob they of hope it be time for change and general election thank the hon lady for her response and the gracious manner in which she accept my apology which be much appreciated the hon lady say that she can not be expect to comment on the pip proposal but remind she that the work capability assessment proposal go through consultation and we still do not know where the labour party stand on those we have speak about fit note reform we be set up workwell and in the autumn we will trial some of those fit note possibility we do not know where the labour party stand at all on those matter one would have think that give the central role that pip play in the welfare system in our society and country the labour party would have some kind of view on that benefit but we hear precisely nothing on that matter because the labour party have no plan the consequence of that will be that as under previous labour governments the welfare bill will continue to spiral out of control that will fall to hard work family up and down the country to pay by way of high taxation the hon lady ask about the abolition of the work capability assessment which as she say be set out in the white paper those measure will not be due to come into effect until we will take into account the conclusion that may be draw as result of this consultation when we consider that matter she raise numerous other question many of which be include in the consultation be sure that she will actively take part in the consultation as we work towards the answer to those question be rather surprised that the hon lady raise the nhs this party be spend more on the national health service than at any time in its history with real term increase in spending over the last couple of year additional nurse and more doctor in the last month alone and from next year billion additional spend on mental health service to which she refer that be on top of the additional billion that the chancellor previously set aside for more mental health treatment and at the last fiscal event additional talk therapy within the national health service the hon lady conclude by refer to harold wilson comment on unemployment simply refer she to the fact that under every single labour government in the history of this country unemployment have be high at the end of their term of office than at the beginning constituent who have cerebral palsy have be in touch with this afternoon to outline how he currently use pip it give he the freedom to live independently and work full time as he use it to buy mobility aide such as hoist and wheelchair his concern be that any change to pip might push those cost on to the nhs and reduce his flexibility to choose what to spend the money on and when he do not want to be push into cycle of renewal that may be too rapid and therefore cost the nhs more money what reassurance can my right hon friend give that this consultation will enable those sort of concern to be highlight and that in the long term it will give more choice and not restrict my constituent freedom thank my right hon friend very much indeed for that question and for raise the issue of her constituent the reassurance can give she be that we be aim for the good outcome there will be number of way in which those good outcome may be achieve that be the purpose of the consultation but it be reasonable to at least explore the issue of whether cash transfer payment be always the right solution particularly give the growth in mental health condition we have see in recent time the final point would make be that we be absolutely interested in example of situation where people have lifelong regressive illness from which unfortunately they be not go to recover and to ask whether under those circumstance it be right to require they to go through re assessment follow today statement the announcement make couple of week ago and all the propose change people be scared they be scared because they rely on these payment which have change their life they have be able to access support that they otherwise would not have be able to get it be very clear that the announce change be not be create by disabled people with disabled people at their heart of the decision make process this be government consultation and then people be be ask to input into it it be totally different from the situation in scotland where the adult disability payment be create with disabled people in the room talk about the good way to make the payment work and the good way to have assessment process basically the answer that come back be do not do they anything like the assessment process for pip everybody should have the income to live with dignity whether or not they be able to work be massively concerned by the comment that the secretary of state and the prime minister allegedly make about people with mental health difficulty only face the ordinary difficulty of life it be very clear that anybody who be able to say that have not suffer from depression and have not feel that absolute energy sapping that come alongside suffer depression or anxiety these be real condition these be real thing that people be struggle with and the lack of the ability to work be just as serious for people with mental health condition as it can be for people with physical health condition have couple of specific question in relation to universal credit it be gateway benefit will the secretary of state assure we that any change that might be make to eligibility criterion around universal credit will be fully consult on and fully discuss particularly with anybody who administer benefit that be allow through those gateway benefit have the secretary of state speak to the scottish government about the creation of the adult disability payment with disabled people in the room ensure that at the forefront of every decision be dignity and respect those be the two key column of the scottish benefit system the secretary of state could learn lot from that approach thank the hon lady for her response to my statement reassure she that disabled people will be very much involve in the process and the consultation it will be week consultation and of course we will take they their comment and representative organisation extremely seriously the hon lady comment about the importance of recognise that many many people unfortunately suffer from very serious mental health challenge be extremely well make be absolutely determined that whatever conclusion we draw from the consultation they should lead we to position where the government be well able to support people who be in those circumstance on whether there will be question in the consultation on the passporting of pip into other benefit the answer be yes that be something we be most certainly consult on on the scottish equivalent of pip this be of course devolved matter yes the department have be in discussion with the equivalent official in the civil service and the scottish government we be look forward to consider as know the scottish government will be the independent review of that benefit which be be conduct at the present time may ask the secretary of state about his comment on the one size fit all model not work if people incur very different cost from their disability surely he be not expect people to send in invoice to prove how much support they need so be he look at have more tier of award for example disability living allowance use to have three tier rather than two be that one of his option for try to reduce cost by mention one size fit all be say that we should explore whether the approach we have at the moment have the good outcome we have much to learn from the experience of country around the world that have similar benefit but go about its organisation and application in different way new zealand make payment base on invoice for equipment submit by those who receive the benefit norway do not have assessment in the way that we do it rely more on evidence provide by medical practitioner we should go into this with an open mind bear in mind that there have be no fundamental review of pip for over decade call the chair of the select committee pip assessment provider confirm that worsen delay in nhs treatment be big factor in the increase in the number of people apply for pip the secretary of state have confirm this afternoon that the work capability assessment be to be scrap and replace by pip assessment there be people who be too ill to work but not disabled and so not eligible for pip how will their support be assess in the absence of work capability assessment as have set out we will need to look at the conclusion that can be draw from the consultation in the context of the replacement of the work capability assessment and pip become the gateway to future universal credit health benefit as the right hon gentleman mention these be question that be be ask in the consultation in the spring of before be elect be diagnose with an anxiety disorder be extremely ill with it and could not work for several month so know for myself how debilitate that can be but also know that with treatment and support you can lead fulfilling career and normal life that be extremely rewarding would have be devastate to have be out of the workforce for the long term how will the reform in the green paper help anxiety sufferer to get the treatment and support that they need to return to work and also to take back their life thank my hon friend for powerful and move contribution to today statement be pleased that she be in such fine form nowadays know she as well as do the answer to her question lie in the consultation and the recognition that the one size fit all approach be not necessarily right those whom she describe may well be well serve by receive treatment rather than cash transfer benefit that be not preconceived outcome that have in my mind but it be one of the possibility on which we be seek opinion the charity sense have criticise the government narrative around disability benefit highlight the divisive and deeply damaging language use which far stigmatise some of the most vulnerable people in society disabled people have tell sense that they be sick with worry about whether they will lose their personal independence payment which be vital lifeline for they give the tory cost of living crisis that we have be live through for multiple year do the secretary of state not think that disabled people need more support not dangerous rhetoric that cast they as undeserve we be certainly not stigmatise anybody far from it indeed in the consultation it be explicitly recognise that there might be some disabled people who need additional help beyond the help that they be get at the moment make reference early to those who have lifetime progressive illness and condition that sadly be not go to improve the question be be ask do we need to ask those individual to attend reassessment and jump through bureaucratic hoop with all the anxiety that may go with that or should we have well system that well look after they totally agree with the secretary of state that everyone get dignity from be in work but he will be aware of the very high level of unemployment experience by those with learn disability and autism bear in mind that able bodied people over struggle to find work let alone those with disability or long term health condition what do he propose do to change the attitude of employer so that they recognise that everyone have skill and role to play and that everyone be an asset thank my hon friend for that really pertinent question she will be familiar with the buckland review which have report be very keen to pursue that review when it come across my desk and make my official and the necessary infrastructure available to ensure that it be able to go ahead it address many of the issue to which my hon friend rightly point in term of employer accommodate and benefit from those who have autism and other condition can start by commend the hon member for rushcliffe ruth edwards on her comment they really go to the heart of some of what we be discuss one of the challenge for the government in talk about pip be that they start this whole conversation by refer to the back to work plan which make many disabled people feel that this be about get they back to work and reduce the overall welfare budget when pip be suppose to be about ensure that they get the right support for their disability on pip big challenge that all mps deal with be the number of error in the system and particularly the number of case that end up at tribunal if we be look into have system that target support well what assurance can the secretary of state give that it will actually be well system with few error there be two point there first error in the benefit system overpayment underpayment and so on be relatively rare secondly on how we approach those who have long term sickness or disability the hon lady will see if she refer to the back to work plan that we be give the million people on those long term benefit the opportunity to try work without fear of lose those benefit at all we have make that extremely explicit that be simply free up the system and try to get rid of some of the barrier that those people otherwise face need to read the detail but on the face of it there be much to be welcome in the secretary of state statement however there be million dla and pip working age recipient and their family who will no doubt be concern about the future of their support so can my right hon friend assure the house that he will tread carefully and think really carefully about tone and the language that we use and that we will listen to those with live experience and the charity that support they thank my hon friend he have do great deal in the important area that this statement and consultation be address as he know my door be always open to he at every step along the way so that can listen to his thought can assure he that question of tone language and treading carefully be absolutely at the forefront of my mind there be people in newcastle central who be out of the workforce and economically inactive due to disability or ill health the government have fail they when it come to the benefit system fail they when it come to support they to work which be so important and fail they when it come to the nhs how will the billion black hole in the government plan to abolish national insurance payment enable the government to fix their failing on the hon lady political point should point out that economic inactivity be low today than in every single year of the last labour government that be our record compare with her party she will know full well that reduce the billion national insurance figure still far and finally eliminate it be very long term aspiration understand why the labour party try to make it more than that what be more than that be the billion that her party suggest will be make available through its energy and net zero offering which it be still talk about to the electorate commend the secretary of state approach as be entirely realistic give that the disability benefit system be not consistently provide support in the way that it be mean to he be also right to take strategic look because he be correct that the understanding of disability and ill health have change quite significantly in britain in some way for the well and there be an imperative to consider that in the light of our labour market and the broad economy the secretary of state be also correct to be comprehensive in his approach in today green paper the prior white paper and other connected work will he also be comprehensive in deliver on those measure across government can he give we assurance about the way that he be set up for the work that will need to be do if this be to be success include with the nhs and local authority for those who need support with their disability or ill health it be my understanding that the nhs perhaps know less than it could about how to help people holistically and individually to move back into work or with the thing that they need and care about finally how be the secretary of state work with employer to ensure that we unlock the workforce productivity need in this country thank my right hon friend for her very astute comment which be build on her great experience of the exact issue that we be discuss both as secretary of state and before that as very successful minister for this area in the department for work and pensions she be absolutely right to recognise that society have change great deal in the year since this benefit be fundamentally review will of course continue to work very closely with my colleague in the national health service and the department of health and social care we collaborate on set up workwell which will be roll out in of the health area of england this autumn bring together the world of work and healthcare the white paper specifically invite thought on how local authority could be more involved in pip or any successor my right hon friend be absolutely right to mention employer and have no doubt that she be aware of the two consultation we have run on increase occupational health in which employer have particularly important role to play the secretary of state question the need to reassess certain group after visit my local motor neurone disease association support group can tell he that those with motor neurone disease be one group who absolutely do not need or deserve reassessment on the wide point about mental health condition hope that the secretary of state will talk to his colleague in the department of health and social care have have many experience of constituent waiting month if not year for the assessment of neurodivergent condition or mental health support we clearly can not address the issue that he want to address in the consultation if we do not fix the nhs workforce crisis the hon gentleman raise very important point about mental health and can reassure he as reassure my right hon friend the member for norwich north chloe smith that we will continue to work very closely with the dhsc on the proposal as they emerge in response to an early question mention that the chancellor have bring forward funding for additional nhs talk therapy for example which may be an important part of what we develop compassion have to be at the heart of this consultation have see patient who have to be reassess repeatedly which do not seem fair but have also see patient who do not engage with service and do not take medication yet be sign off which be not compassionate either one practical way forward be to bring dwp close to gp surgery so that people can have their hand hold when they get to diagnosis whether it be of anxiety or physical complaint or whether they be recover from an operation will the minister consider that in the consultation dwp join up with primary care would be fantastic way to help gps help their patient and to help the dwp thank my hon friend for sensible set of question he refer to the importance of bring gps together with advice and support to get people into work that be very much the focus of our fit note reform upon which we have call for evidence at the moment be grateful to the minister for his swift response to my request early this afternoon for support for the people at everest in treherbert who look likely to lose their job in the next few day depression and anxiety be real be they not it be not just question of people pull up their sock as some in the crueller part of the commentariat have suggest all too often talk therapy be least available in the area with the high level of economic inactivity so how be we go to change that on the intersection between mental health and physical health that be acquire brain injury do the department even know how many people who have have an acquire brain injury be in receipt of pip or of universal credit if the minister do not know the answer today will he write to if both he and his department do not know the answer as bet be the case will he make sure that the department find out before it implement something that could provide even more problem for people who be try to get their life back together first thank the hon gentleman for his comment about the job situation in his constituency let reassure he that my department will do whatever it can to assist with those circumstance the hon gentleman rightly point out that depression anxiety and mental health condition be very real and in many case extremely severe which be why be absolutely determined that we should do whatever we can where appropriate to provide as much support as possible to people as for his question about acquire brain injury and how many pip recipient be in that situation do not think he would expect to know off the top of my head it would be rather impressive if do know will as he have suggest write to he you have never impress before and have know you very long time that be probably fair as the hon gentleman point out he have know for very long time and recall that when we be at university together he be young conservative as be how thing have progress or perhaps should say regress since then do my right hon friend agree that my proposal over the past few year to improve support in the workplace for mental health be essential as part of this programme of work do he also agree that one aspect of that which have raise repeatedly in my work and suggestion would be to make sure that physical and mental health be give firm parity in the health and safety executive guideline believe that would help both employer and employee both in my constituency and nationally we be consider the issue of parity that my hon friend have raise he be absolutely right to raise the issue of mental health support occupational health support within business which be why we have consult on that matter be particularly keen to see what we can do not just for large company but for small and medium sized enterprise to make sure that they engage more fully in that respect considerable number of constituent have already contact because they be worried about what the government be propose the key message they want to get across be that have disability or serious mental illness be not their choice and not something they have control over the secretary of state mention tailor support an awful lot in his statement my experience be that when people with disability have engagement with the system and have to go through the process of make an application be assess and so on that be cause of great anxiety and often the decision be wrong if he be propose more tailor support and more engagement with bureaucracy particularly for people with fluctuate condition such as myalgic encephalomyelitis how be he go to get it right he have not manage to get it right so far be absolutely determined that we be not go to be see more bureaucracy indeed set out that one question we be explore in the consultation relate to those who sadly have condition from which they be not go to recover or improve in those circumstance want to see less bureaucracy and system where we be not have to reassess people in superfluous way cause anxiety and put they to that inconvenience the other point that the hon lady raise be of course exactly the kind of question we be ask in the consultation and urge the constituent who have write to she to engage in that consultation process over the next three month my right hon friend be right to emphasise the importance of focus on what people can do rather than what they can not and it be worth note that there be million more disabled people in work than year ago however as he mention the benefit system be not just about work it be about ensure people live full and independent life he say that during the consultation there will be engagement with disabled people and their representative organisation which be critical but each individual need be personal to they so how will he ensure as many voice as possible be listen to during the consultation the consultation will be very thorough it be available in accessible format to ensure we cater to the great extent that we can and that we get the good possible and most universal feedback be pleased that my hon friend speak to the issue of the employment of disabled people in we set year target of million more disabled people in employment we break that target in five year rather than announce that disabled people suffer from certain condition will no long receive support payment but instead get improve access to treatment be one of the most absurd policy to have come out of this government in the past year the government plan rely on imagined brilliant mental healthcare support be available be the minister even aware how long people have to wait for treatment after be refer after year of this tory government gutte our nhs and our mental healthcare even basic access to treatment do not exist let along the improved access the minister be rely on in the fantasy world he live in simply do not recognise the comment the hon gentleman have make about our national health service there be more people work in the national health service than at any time in its history more nurse and more doctor in the past year alone we be spend record sum on the national health service will not give chapter and verse as do early as to the other thing we be do but we be completely committed to the health and mental health of people up and down the country there will be new way of do thing if we do not have grow up conversation as describe it about those matter we will not discover those new way workwell be completely new way of address issue such as mental health and encourage people to stay or go back into work it do not exist month ago it come about because we consult people and come up with solution would like to give the secretary of state the benefit of the doubt and he have make number of important point but those million people and their family who will have hear his statement will be absolutely terrified lot of they will feel that the reform be just about provide some kind of cut to service believe that we need to try to support those people and put compassion at the heart of our welfare system there be report of up to million people wait for mental health treatment at the moment so do the secretary of state believe that in this compassionate review where we be go to have grow up conversation we will be able to see more money invest to ensure that those million people can get more mental health support my hon friend raise important point that be core to the consultation that be be carry out the corollary to my hon friend argument be that we should not do anything and stay with system that have not be revisit for over decade despite the fact that the terrain have change substantially not least in term of the increase in those suffering from mental health condition say no to that we need to have grow up conversation about these matter if we be to provide well support for the people whom hon member across the house care about the minister be right economic inactivity rate have soar because of ill health and where possible we want those people to get back into work it be for their own good it be also for the good of the hard work taxpayer to have those cost minimise however give that these proposal come at the tail end of government who have just week or month to go doubt very much that the measure will become reality for many people have one question for the minister as this issue be devolve to the northern ireland assembly have he have any discussion with the executive about these proposal if he have what response do he get should the executive go in different direction what will the economic consequence be for the northern ireland executive budget the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to talk about the importance of work in the context of mental health that be my strongly hold belief he be also right to raise the issue of the fiscal sustainability of our welfare system if the public be to continue to have confidence in that system we must get the balance right between the requirement of the taxpayer and our absolute determination to support those most in need of help the right hon gentleman ask specific question about the northern ireland executive he be right it be possible for northern ireland to decide to manage its benefit in different way to england that be not traditionally what have happen traditionally northern ireland have follow the move that we have make as to discussion absolutely there be always close ongoing discussion between my department and our counterpart in northern ireland the secretary of state have say that the government approach be fair and compassionate can he tell what be compassionate about the language use by the prime minister over the past fortnight when he have refer to sick note culture imply that people who be force to rely on benefit do so as lifestyle choice and today talk about the arrest seizure and crackdown on benefit claimant the disability poverty campaign group which comprise the major charity that we have all work with describe the speech as chill threaten and stigmatise do the secretary of state not realise that the language that the prime minister have use increase prejudice against disabled people and contribute to the escalation of hate crime against disabled people the prime minister share my view which be that it be really important that we achieve the good possible outcome for the people whom we be discuss in this statement he care great deal and think he say at the end of his speech that he want to help many people some of whom be watch the screen flicker away while their opportunity drift off into the distance or word to that effect that speak from the heart that say that we have prime minister who care deeply that opportunity in our society should be make as widely available as possible that be view characteristic and quality that admire and that share with he the secretary of state have upset many disabled people and organisation with his clumsy negative and juvenile approach mind for example have ask for grow up conversation furthermore the secretary of state say at the dispatch box today that there have never be review of personal independence payment but there have be two independent review commission by the department so perhaps he could correct the record when he get to his foot pip be not an out of work benefit so when will the department publish its assessment of the impact of these late cut on disabled people use pip to support themselves in work it be the case that there have not be fundamental review of pip on the basis that that have subsequently lead to change in that benefit therefore it be the case that that benefit have remain fundamentally the same for more than decade it actually come in in as the hon gentleman will know on what assessment may or may not be make available think they will come at point when the government arrive at their conclusion have conduct the consultation member of this house may remember that have to take leave of absence from this role three year ago because have post traumatic stress disorder can tell the house that the insinuation that mental health condition be not debilitate do not affect people ability to go about their daily life or to go to work and do not incur additional cost could not be further from the truth the prime minister comment about so call sick note culture and the change that the government be propose will do nothing to help people with mental illness and will just make their life hard why be the government set back the clock on the acceptance of mental illness as disability instead of truly tackle the crisis in mental health support be at pain to say this every time have come to the dispatch box this afternoon think have make it extremely clear that serious mental health condition be very real take they very seriously as think do everyone in this house say to the hon this be where we need grow up conversation interruption this be really important we need proper conversation about this because if at every stage whenever minister suggest that we need to look at particular area their motif get impugn in the way that the hon lady she infer that be actually say that mental health condition should be trivialise in some way be definitely not say that my constituent elizabeth have be very hard worker but also someone who have suffer from ill health she come to see at my surgery on friday to express her alarm about the prime minister speech on april his proposal for sick note and what she see as his lack of respect for the professionalism of general practitioner if the issue come up in the chamber she ask to ask the relevant minister this question how can random dwp assessor face with complete stranger base on the brief of interaction be rely upon to produce more accurate and objective assessment of patient condition than her own general practitioner know the prime minister share the view that we owe huge debt of gratitude to our gps right up and down the country they have highly pressurised job and they do it extremely well dwp assessor be highly train individual and there be very clear guideline on how assessment should be fairly conduct they be as the hon and learn lady will know open to appeal where that be necessary she mention gps as part of the assessment which be conclude by dwp team member rather than the assessor themselves take into account all the evidence it may well be that gps have an input into many of the decision the secretary of state must understand that the rhetoric come from the government over the past few week have be brutal divisive and induce unimaginable terror in the two third of people already in destitution who have chronic health condition or disability the prospect of further cut be make the situation bad can he confirm whether he expect overall government pip spend to be reduce and if so by how much and what assessment he have make of how his proposal will affect those who be already in material deprivation the presumption that the hon lady make be that the alternative to consult on different and potentially much well way forward be to do nothing at all to that be unacceptable in term of ensure that we truly support all those who need support have already give that reassurance from the dispatch box it be make very clear in the consultation that we recognise that there will be people who need more support than they be receive at the moment but we need to have that conversation in order to get the good outcome language matter as we have hear and the government have be warn that the language and rhetoric perhaps not from the secretary of state himself but from other risk minimise the impact of mental health condition which be real and serious what be the government plan to ensure that proper treatment be available not just talk therapy but whatever treatment be appropriate to ensure that people with mental health condition be treat appropriately the hon lady raise an extremely important point the prevalence of mental health condition in our country have grow there be many reason for that know the labour party like to say it be all about the nhs but it be about many other thing not least social medium among young people there be many cause the consultation will look at exactly the question she quite rightly raise she mention the nhs talk therapy think that particularly for some less severe mental health condition combine with work they can make real difference be very pleased when my right hon friend the chancellor bring in more of those talk therapy at his last fiscal event back in bad concussion leave out of work for several month over time become deeply depressed worried and anxious that would never get back to full time work at all be lucky that my employer be able to find and to pay for to get the support need to get back to work and be lucky enough to be here today however for many across the country that simply be not the reality they face why be the government not focus on make sure everyone have the support they need to get back into work rather than fall back into the kind of political posturing that will only add to the stress and anxiety that thousand already feel if may say so first be very pleased that the hon gentleman be now fit and well and be sorry he go through the difficult time that he describe we be do huge amount he may or may not be familiar with universal support which be there not only to place the kind of people he have describe into work but critically to stay with they for period of up to month to make sure they have the support to hold that job down we know that work be good for those with mental health condition have already refer to workwell which bring together those who have mental health challenge and work coach who be able to see how work can fit within their recovery programme we be very much do those thing if he would like to see at some point after this statement would be happy to sit down with he and talk he through some of the other approach we be take today statement have be make necessary by the huge deterioration in the nation health and mental health since the pandemic think the whole house have to take responsibility because this house vote for draconian lockdown that devastate mental health particularly among the young this house vote to mandate untested experimental treatment threaten people that they would lose their job if they do not take they while give immunity from prosecution to the manufacturer for their dangerous and defective product will the minister do the good thing he can for public mental health by assure the british public that these mistake have be learn from and will never be inflict upon they again be afraid simply do not subscribe to the theory that the hon gentleman promote think it be probably good to leave it at that thank the secretary of state for his statement and for respond to question point of order on point of order mr deputy speaker during the urgent question on the humanitarian situation in gaza on april the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs the hon member for macclesfield david rutley speak on behalf of the foreign secretary say that the government want an independent review of the terrible killing of british aid worker by the israel defence forces that follow the foreign secretary himself post on that wholly independent review be require however in response to my write question the deputy foreign secretary say that the prime minister have call for transparent investigation into that terrible attack transparent investigation be not the same as an independent investigation give that the whole point of my question in the chamber be to highlight that investigation conduct by the idf into its action be not independent this answer trouble give also that the foreign secretary refuse to come to this chamber to be hold accountable can you advise mr deputy speaker how can clarify whether the minister do not accidentally mislead the house in say that the government want an independent investigation when they be only call for transparent investigation all those who seek accountability for the action of the idf want to know what the government position be thank the hon lady for give notice of her point of order clearly the chair be not responsible for the answer of ministers but those on the treasury bench will have hear the point of order and will make sure that the minister be able to respond to she on point of order mr deputy speaker seek your advice on how we in this house can ensure that the national security online information team investigate the facebook group that greenpeace expose at the weekend of which the tory mayoral candidate susan hall be member people have put on this group that they plan to kill our current mayor sadiq khan how can we make sure the government be investigate that thank the hon member for her point of order and for give forward notice of it be sure she could make contact herself with any organisation that can investigate the serious allegation she have just make on point of order mr deputy speaker early today the minister for schools say that the statistic quote on secondary teacher recruitment target be incorrect often repeat and not right be afraid it be the minister who be incorrect the department for education own website state in bold that of the initial teacher training recruitment target for secondary teacher be reach in which be what say in raw number that be secondary school teacher trainee recruit on to course out of the the government say be need we do not need math to to work out that that be less than of the target furthermore say in my question that some subject be miss those target by yet in many subject they be miss they by way more for instance physic only meet of its target have you have any indication mr deputy speaker that the minister plan to correct the record if not how do you suggest go about secure correction thank the hon lady for her point of order and for give forward notice of it again the chair be not responsible for ministerial response but those on the treasury bench will have hear her remark and of course we would expect any alteration or correction to be make as soon as possible will now hand over to dame rosie winterton for the rest of the business post office horizon system offences bill

place which be determined not to bring scotland into the bill this morning robert thomson chris dawson and keith macaldowie three sub postmaster travel from scotland to be here to listen to the reason that scotland should not be include in the bill unfortunately there be two urgent question statement and train break down so they have have to go back and could not be here to watch the people in this house hold the fate of their exoneration in their hand there be huge legal misgiving about and potential constitutional implication to the bill as legal authority across the united kingdom have say however to use the word of the minister of state department for business and trade the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake we recognise that this be an exceptional step but these be exceptional circumstance official report january vol postmaster across the united kingdom want this exoneration bill to succeed as do those of we on the snp benches it must succeed we need to get the exoneration through this place in order that convict sub postmaster across the united kingdom can claim compensation and redress for what they have suffer have before the witness statement from robert thomson who during his court case have to sit down with his two young son to tell they of the real possibility that he would have to go to prison how awful be that how awful it be for all the other sub postmaster who have have to go through the very same experience my hon friend talk about go to prison my constituent lose her liberty her good name her house her marriage her family her whole existence because of this situation she have have to move to my constituency life on her own the government be deny my constituent the justice she deserve do my hon friend agree that that be utterly shameful utterly shameful do not even begin to describe it right up until quite recently the government say that they would include scotland in the bill but they have decide not to do so for spurious reason today have be talk to sub postmaster and have invite scottish mps to come and speak the main reason some scottish mp whether they be liberal democrats or conservative ministers do not want to include scotland be that the first minister say that he do not want to see criminal exonerate when they be guilty no one want have hear the minister himself say that previously in this house admire the passion with which my hon friend be speak on behalf of sub postmaster do she agree that part of the sense of insult upon injury be that there be no proper explanation as to why scotland can not be include so it look like petty partisanship and have to say madam deputy speaker that that be bear out by the chuntering sniggering and laughter go on behind as my hon friend speak my hon friend be right be passionate about this as chair of the all party parliamentary group on post office have deliberately work on this issue across party for year have work with everyone indeed when write to the prime minister at one point have signature from every party include from member of sinn féin party that do not attend the house have also hear it say today that the lord advocate do not want this well at no point have the lord advocate take view on propose legislation either in westminster or in holyrood the lord advocate be not responsible for bring case of miscarriage of justice before the court of appeal in scotland have work with the hon lady in her role as chair of the appg and commend she for her work over many year the point about the lord advocate be surely that the route to justice must go through the scottish parliament because the route to prosecution go through the scottish parliament that be where the route of accountability lie interruption there be some talk about chuntere early but it seem to go in more than one way refer the hon lady to the comment of the lord advocate in the scottish parliament on january if the lord advocate really want the bill to proceed she could say so in term herself interruption chunter on boy do not think that be an edify intervention will my hon friend take an edifying intervention yes be my hon friend as surprised as that the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael former prosecutor do not understand that prosecution do not go through the scottish parliament the prosecution service in scotland be completely independent of parliament that be fundamental aspect of our constitution be she as shocked as that the right hon gentleman do not understand that and do she agree that the fact that he miss such fundamental point rather undermine the force of his argument thank my hon and learn friend for make that point the body responsible for bring miscarriage of justice before the court of appeal in scotland be the scottish criminal cases review commission which be not under the spell of the lord advocate that argument be spurious to say the least my hon friend be make an excellent speech be she aware of the evidence give by professor james chalmers of the university of glasgow to the justice committee couple of week ago he be ask this very question and he say that in his view it be well that the legislation go through this place with legislative consent motion in the scottish parliament because it be tie directly to the uk compensation scheme for this area thank my hon friend for that intervention yes be very aware that the regius professor of law at the university of glasgow make that very point to the justice committee there have be widespread disquiet think the chair of that committee the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill would agree that no one in the legal profession really want this bill it be break all precedent but for really good reason postmaster have suffer robert thomson the postmaster who be go to be sit in the gallery be convict in while his mother be still alive he be the man who have to talk to his son and tell they might not be here tomorrow he do not go to prison but he could not get job that give he the income that he have when he be postmaster he have be in penury his life have be turn upside down and his child have suffer enormously that be the case for so many sub postmaster across the united kingdom they do nothing wrong yet people be point at they in the street and whispering another sub postmaster who be go to be in the gallery watch we all today have to move back to his hometown because five year later he hear people in the supermarket say there the guy who steal from the post office this kind of thing never leave those victim they will carry it to their die day robert thomson mother die before her son spend two year go through the scottish court to be exonerate every time have be in this place when any legal issue come up be tell that this parliament be sovereign well prove it put the provision of this bill into scotland wide use as well interruption member can stand at the back smile and snigger but mean it it be absolutely disgraceful that you be say to scottish sub postmaster who be convict that they can not get justice at the same time as their english welsh and northern irish counterpart this be westminster problem westminster must and should sort it out and it be easily do ask for legislative consent motion and you will get it the scottish parliament will put bill through to exonerate these postmaster but it can not do it it can not mirror exactly what be do in this place until this bill have go through all of its stage have regard to the evidence of professor chalmers who of course be regius professor of criminal law at glasgow university that address this problem would be well do in this place do my hon friend agree that we often hear sanctimonious lecture from the uk government about how scotland two government should work together to benefit scotland this legislation deal with problem make on the uk government watch be it not the perfect example of an issue on which scotland two government should act together with the uk government take the lead in the same way that they have do for northern ireland and the scottish government consent so that we can get justice do swiftly for scottish postmaster and postmistress in the same way as it have be do for other people in this glorious union that tory members be always tell we about yes be appalled upset and disturb by the fact that the scottish government have be try to contact westminster ministers to get this bill to cover scotland as well and there be no comeback and no correspondence nobody bother one afternoon within two hour period the minister who greatly admire as he know have very good working relationship with he be able to phone the northern irish first minister deputy first minister and justice minister thank the hon lady for give way have meet the scottish justice minister twice online the reason meet the northern ireland ministers physically be that they come here to parliament to meet we may push back on something that the hon lady say few moment ago she say that this parliament be sovereign absolutely it be sovereign but on these matter her parliament be also sovereign interruption clearly as she say early in her remark there be legal controversy on these matter she have admit that herself this parliament be take the legal risk in that area but be the hon lady aware of her lord advocate position on this particular matter these be her actual word it be important to recognise that in scotland there be an established route of appeal in circumstance such as this and that due process must be follow scottish parliament official report january do the hon lady not believe that in that situation her parliament should act to overturn these conviction be quite anxious that we do not have too many long intervention so that if hon member want to catch my eye there be plenty of time for debate madam deputy speaker hate to disagree with you as you know do not do that but there will be no more time for some member to speak on this bill if it do not include scotland in his intervention the minister say that the scottish parliament be sovereign well there be surprise we on the snp benches all want scotland to be sovereign but it be the people who have sovereignty in scotland not the parliament we be dance on the head of pin madam deputy speaker which be not my intention it be very clear so clear that it be transparent that party politic be involve in all of this six day ago the secretary of state for business and trade describe the scottish parliament as lazy and ask why it do not put through its own legislation believe it can and it will if it have to but why should scottish postmaster wait long for justice on second reading in this place say that there be likely to be to ing and fro ing and that it would probably be july before this bill be pass on behalf of my constituent who have be affect by this scandal thank my hon friend for the astonishing amount of work she have do in this area be it not the case that while it would certainly create issue for the legal officer in scotland if scotland be include in this westminster bill bill in the scottish parliament would create exactly the same issue for they the concern for legal officer on both side of the border be that they do not like it when parliamentarian overturn the decision of the court but it have to be do this time because some of the postmaster will not live to see their compensation if we do not get on with it soon thank my hon friend for that intervention hear the minister chuntere from sedentary position that scottish ministers should take responsibility for this indicate assent they will but they do not cause the need for this bill this be westminster issue and should be sort out here madam deputy speaker be incense people may have realise that this be not fake anger this be real issue for those man who come down here today they be representative of the sub postmaster and mistress in scotland and we have not even start to talk about the effect on their family and those who have die two year it take robert thomson to go through court during which time his mother die and it be the same story right across all the postmaster who have lose family member and postmaster have commit suicide this have to be sort go back to my original point scottish postmaster will be behind the curve when it come to apply for the due compensation they be entitle to if they be not exonerate at the same time as the rest of the postmaster in the uk this be piece of nonsense get it do for scotland the government have do it for northern ireland get it do for scotland thank the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows for her remark and her engagement it have always be pleasure to work with she both in the chamber and in other area yes we have work cross party and have be very keen to do that all the way through on these matter but that do not of course mean we always agree be very grateful to have the opportunity to meet the hon lady early with the scottish postmaster she refer to be sorry that they have not be able to attend this debate however at that point be able to explain to those postmaster why the government oppose this motion as our position remain unchanged that this bill should not be amend to include scotland just want to ask the minister what do the scottish postmaster say to you order the hon lady know she must not refer directly to the minister in that way but do so through the chair beg your pardon madam deputy speaker what do the scottish sub postmaster say to the minister this afternoon be they pleased be they happy and do they feel they be get justice through this action listen to the postmaster very carefully and of course they would prefer we to legislate in the way the hon lady describe set out very clearly the reason why we would not do so and think they hear the concern we raise about how we think we should proceed scotland have historically separate legal jurisdiction and the lord advocate and the crown office and procurator fiscal service have unique role in prosecution in scotland we feel it be more appropriate for the scottish government to bring forward proposal to address prosecution on this matter in scotland and for those to be scrutinise by the scottish parliament the first minister have previously make public comment suggest that the uk government approach to the criterion in our legislation be too broad in relation to the conviction it would quash he be report in the national on march to have say that he want to make sure that people who have genuinely commit crime do not then have access to compensation we have be clear from the start that there be real risk of that happen with our approach have the minister take the time to read the evidence take at the justice committee when professor chalmers say that the purpose of the bill be to make sure conviction can be quash so that innocent people can be compensate the scandal originate with faulty computer system and dubious investigatory procedure within uk wide institution the scheme for compensation be to be uk wide so the pave legislation should be uk wide too that be the opinion of the regius professor of criminal law at the university of glasgow have the minister give that any thought and can he tell why it be wrong thank the hon and learn member for her point and hear the point she raise early it be very clear that all that be require for someone to access the compensation be the overturning of conviction and that can be do by mean choose by the scottish parliament or the mean that have be choose by the uk parliament there will be identical access to the compensation scheme it make no difference by whatever mechanism those conviction be overturn as say early the lord advocate have say very clearly that it be important to recognise that in scotland there be an established route of appeal in circumstance such as this and that due process must be follow scottish parliament official report january she be of course entitle to that view these be difficult political choice which we have take in define the cohort criterion and it be right that responsible ministers remain accountable for those decision the buck stop here and it must also stop with the scottish government be confuse at the inconsistency here so perhaps the minister could help we the government be put through criminal justice bill that impact on scotland which have require the scottish parliament to pass legislative consent motion for that bill so if it be good enough for the criminal justice bill go through this place why be it not good enough for this bill to go through this place as say early scottish ministers have the responsibility and the mean to be able to form this legislation we think it be important that they take responsibility for their decision in this area give the nature of these issue will the minister give way will make some progress if may note that the first minister state on thursday april that the scottish government be prepared to introduce legislation to the scottish parliament to overturn conviction understand from the hon member for motherwell and wishaw that that legislation have actually be draft and believe it be possible and necessary for the scottish government to do so swiftly our position on scotland inclusion in the bill be very clear the government make statement on february to that effect and have write to the scottish government on this point indeed the first minister comment together with the propose draft amendment to the uk bill that the scottish government have publish suggest that they should be in position to do so the uk government remain committed to support the scottish government to progress their own approach to their legislation have meet scottish government ministers multiple time since this bill be introduce and official at the department for business and trade and the ministry of justice hold weekly meeting with official in the scottish government to discuss these issue in conclusion remain of the view that the scottish government should introduce their own legislation to quash conviction in their jurisdiction as such the government oppose this motion call the shadow minister the horizon scandal be one of the most egregious miscarriage of justice in british history and it have rob sub postmaster of their life their liberty and their livelihood we welcome the government inclusion of northern ireland in the territorial scope of this bill follow our representation include on second reading we agree that sub postmaster in scotland who have be victim of this devastating scandal need urgent exoneration and compensation as much as case in england wales and northern ireland want to commend the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows for her work in tirelessly campaign for victim across the united kingdom especially in scotland and her work in the appg however the case of scotland inclusion provide unique set of issue unlike in northern ireland there have not be unite support for scotland inclusion in the bill both the scottish judiciary and number of msp have publicly oppose this course of action do the hon lady agree with that many people in england wales and northern ireland have vociferously oppose the bill but actually understand as people do in scotland that it be necessary and that it be pragmatic solution to situation that have be go on for far too long thank the hon lady for her intervention but the reality be that this be very unusual bill and there be serious issue which we will go on to debate about the separation of power between the legislature and the judiciary in context where as have say there be disagreement between the judiciary and the legislature in scotland we believe it be not appropriate for the united kingdom parliament to overrule the scottish judiciary it should be for holyrood to make that call and pass mirror bill therefore we intend to abstain on this motion to include scotland thank the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows for organise the briefing for we today attend it think there be only one sub postmaster and one solicitor present at the time but it be useful to hear from they pay tribute as have do before to she for the work that she have do suppose it be consequence of the motion before the house that we have emphasise its procedural aspect more heavily than the outcome but the house today need to focus on the good possible outcome for sub postmaster if there have be insistence on the northern ireland assembly draw up legislation that would have require week minimum statutory consultation period and that would have produce bad outcome for sub postmaster in northern ireland for that reason think that the direction in which the minister move be absolutely sensible be afraid that do not take the same view on the position in scotland include scotland in the bill would leave unresolved issue and the bill would therefore leave scottish postmaster in poor position than those in the rest of the country rise will the hon and learn lady let explain why take that view on january the lord advocate make the follow observation and think that she be quite right the vast majority of the case that may be affect by the issue be case in which the accuse plead guilty to the offence often those plea be tender under legal representation although it be impossible to comment on every case prosecutor do not mark case to proceed in the absence of corroboration they simply do not do that defence solicitor do not advise client to plead guilty in the absence of corroboration in case that proceed to trial the sheriff do not convict in the absence of corroboration as result it be reasonable to infer that in case that result in conviction whether by guilty plea or conviction after trial other evidence be available that be capable of support the finding of guilt as have explain not every horizon case will involve miscarriage of justice in some case there be sufficient evidence to support criminal conviction scottish parliament official report january that be the view and analysis of the lord advocate essentially what she be say have always believe that this be right be that because of the way that the law of evidence and procedure operate in scotland and in particular because of the need for corroboration qualitative safeguard that bring well outcome be available to people who be before the scottish court the presence of corroboration be an important part of scot law and the lord advocate be right to highlight that as she have raise these issue believe that it be well for legislation to be make in the scottish parliament where the equivalent to this stage would take place in committee and not in the chamber as be the case here again that be preferable do the right hon gentleman not appreciate that the concern that the lord advocate have express be similar to those express by lawyer from across these island about this legislation ultimately it be parliament decision whether to exonerate have he read the evidence give to the criminal justice committee and do he disagree with professor chalmers who say that the purpose of the bill be to make sure that conviction can be quash so that innocent people can be compensate quickly that the scandal originate with faulty computer system and dubious investigate procedure in uk wide institution and that the scheme for compensation be uk wide so the pave legislation should be uk wide that be not my opinion it be the opinion of one of scotland most pre eminent criminal lawyer the regius professor at glasgow can the right hon gentleman tell why he be wrong the hon and learn lady have say herself that this be matter of opinion put great confidence in the opinion of professor chalmers but come to different conclusion because the route to conviction lie through civil servant employ by the scottish as the hon and learn lady remind we almost three decade ago be one of they so understand perfectly how the system work and also understand that if ever get it wrong incredible though that suggestion may seem the accountability for my mistake would be through the lord advocate note that nobody have challenge the very important point that because the scottish legislation have to mirror uk legislation it can not be pass until this bill have have royal assent the right hon gentleman have experience of the system in his experience once the scottish parliament can start consider legislation what would be the minimum delay before scotland catch up secondly do he agree that it would be outrageous for anyone to try to shut down the scottish parliament in the meantime to build in further unnecessary delay be intrigue to know what that final question about shut down the scottish parliament be about but it be open to the scottish parliament to deal with such matter through an emergency procedure that would be sensible and it would bring sub postmaster across the whole united kingdom to exactly the same place at the end of the day that can be do in matter of day as be sure the hon gentleman be aware we have hear from other that the legislation be draft and ready to go so as matter of politic what be it that the scottish national party do not want to admit as far as be concern and as far as the snp be concern politic do not come into this it be about get justice for scottish sub postmaster and postmaster across the rest of the united kingdom at the same time want to make it clear that intervention need to be question to the person make the speech do the right hon gentleman not agree the hon lady have get it the hon lady know that agree with she lot more than either of we would ever admit but on this matter there be clearly difference of opinion the decision on whether the route to exoneration should be through the scottish parliament or through this place be political choice sense that the right hon gentleman be reach his peroration and as we be both scots lawyer wonder if he will join in correct the labour party spokesperson the hon member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali she say repeatedly that the scottish judiciary do not want this legislation the right hon gentleman will know that the scottish judiciary like the english judiciary would never comment on the desirability of legislation do he agree that the hon lady be get mix up with the lord advocate perhaps she should have chance to correct the record later because it be very important that the house do not give the impression that the scottish judiciary have be criticise parliament when they have not say gently to the hon and learn lady that the scottish judiciary would never comment publicly because in my experience they have way of make their view know but she be right to point out that on this occasion the opposition spokesperson confuse the office of the lord advocate with the judiciary would say to the hon and learn lady however that that in itself demonstrate to the need for this matter to be deal with where the expertise lie which be the scottish parliament find myself in the unusual position of support an snp motion it be probably the first time suspect it will be the last the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows have show her dedication to the people whom she represent have sit in committee with she and have listen to she in debate and know how passionately she feel about this matter she be not in my view just make political point she honestly believe that postmaster and postmistress in scotland who have be wrong by the post office which carelessly deal with her case deserve the same justice as those in northern ireland england and wales appreciate the fact that the minister listen to voice from northern ireland since come into his position this matter have go on for long time he have be dedicate to resolve the issue and praise he for that but we have one last part of the jigsaw that need to be deal with it could be deal with by include scotland in the bill as northern ireland have be include like other who have speak pay tribute to the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows for the work that she have do we all feel for the postmaster throughout scotland but do the right hon gentleman accept that lot of people in scotland watch this be wonder why the snp argument be not with the lord advocate the person responsible for this delay why be snp members bring it here why be their government not take this up with the lord advocate do not know about the relationship between the lord advocate and the scottish national party but do know that remedy be go through this house today that could dispense with whatever difference there might be in scotland and deal with an issue that all of we in this house be agree need to be deal with quickly have listen to the argument make by the minister and other that due process need to be follow indeed have listen to the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael who say you have to remember that the scottish system be different the level of proof in scotland be different there be great information available the implication be that when the scottish parliament consider this it might come to the conclusion that some of the conviction be safe and some postmaster and postmistress would not be exonerate at all we have not take that view for the rest of the united kingdom indeed some judge have argue that not all the conviction be unsafe but we have decide that give how the whole horizon situation be deal with it be fair that we take the view that the problem may affect some people who be rightly convict and do not start go through each case remember that an argument make by number of members here be why do we do this case by case the situation be different in scotland the lord advocate position be exactly that she do not want to risk one person who be rightly convict be exonerate it be therefore impossible for scotland to follow the same route as we at the moment as be detail in the scottish parliament early this year the lord advocate be against mass exoneration until she change her position and the advice that she give to the scottish government it be impossible for they to follow what we be do in the house of commons through this bill do not know whether the hon gentleman be not listen to but make the point that although there may be case in other part of the united kingdom that be in the same situation give the exceptional circumstance we be prepared to exonerate if the lord advocate position be as he say fair enough but parliament be make this decision for people in england northern ireland and wales as the bill be available to we we should apply it to people in scotland as well be grateful to be give the chance to make possibly the only supportive intervention will ever make on the right hon gentleman do he not agree that if the possibility of single guilty person walk free be really such barrier we would never have the requirement for guilt to be prove beyond reasonable doubt not only in scotland but in england wales and northern ireland in judicial system we accept that it be well for guilty person to go free than for an innocent person to go to jail will move on because madam deputy speaker be catch my eye will the right hon gentleman give way will not because just want to make two more point first the minister have say it can be do quickly through the parliament in scotland the scottish parliament can not start the process until the law have go through here think can say this although some snp members might not be able to the situation in scotland at the moment do not look good for get legislation through quickly for any reason because of the uncertainty around the leadership what will happen and what support there will be there be parallel with the situation we have in northern ireland one of the argument we make be over special circumstance with the assembly just be set up again and the delay that might cause the minister argument could mean further delay in get justice for postmaster and postmistress in scotland may just point out that the legislation apparently have already be draft for scotland there be no requirement for scotland legislation to mirror our legislation that would be up to the scottish parliament and it be clear that be the case will the right hon gentleman accept that it be not just the lord advocate who be against what we be do the first minister himself say as say early that people with safe conviction should not have access to compensation we be clear that the route we be take raise that likelihood it be therefore only right that the scottish parliament take this decision that have be the minister position throughout the discussion we have early be still argue for include scotland on the basis of consistency fairness speed and the political signal we should be send to people in scotland no snp member will make this point but will we have already hear in this debate that this be more of political decision the scottish national party feel that it be be get at sometimes it deserve to be get at but my point be this when there be mechanism to avoid it why create sense of victimhood people feel they have be get at and have be treat differently when they could have be treat in the same way as the rest of the united kingdom do not think there be any political merit in exclude scotland from this legislation for the people who have be wrong in the horizon scandal for the people who have have their reputation damage and for the picture of this parliament as fair parliament deal with people right across the united kingdom who have be affect by united kingdom problem believe this motion should be pass today and scotland should be include along with northern ireland start by pay tribute to several people across this house from number of different party when arrive here last year could tell they have already be work hard on this issue include my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones and the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows there be consensus across the house that this huge injustice must be right the question as we have hear from number of people be how that be do in scotland and that be what want to speak to briefly want to make two point first there be the question of speed which we have hear about number of time but more importantly there be the question of accountability accountability be important the scottish parliament have responsibility for justice in scotland scotland have always have separate legal system since long before the scottish parliament be re established and as we have hear there be the question of the lord advocate position of how conviction be take forward not by the post office by but by the crown of the basis of evidence use will the hon gentleman give way may make bit of progress will then give way there be also the question of the evidence use around corroboration there be difference in the conviction more importantly the hon member for motherwell and wishaw speak about one of the organisation involve the scottish criminal cases review commission which she rightly say be the body that bring case for review in scotland but she do not mention the accountability aspect the commission be create by an act of the scottish parliament be responsible to the scottish parliament and get its budget from the scottish government there be clear line of accountability between the scottish justice secretary the scottish government and the body responsible for review these conviction so the accountability be clearly with the scottish parliament may put it to the hon gentleman that he be completely misunderstand what we be deal with we be deal with absolutely extraordinary legislation that be quash conviction as gateway to compensation give we lecture of dubious accuracy on the line of accountability of the crown office in scotland do not address that this legislation be go over the head of the crown prosecution service in england just as it would go over the head of the crown office in scotland why can not he appreciate that point be it because he be play politic with the issue like his front bench colleague the suggestion of dubious lecture come from the scottish national party be slightly misguided accept the point that the legislation go above normal legal precedent but there be no reason why the scottish parliament could not invoke its emergency bill procedure as it have do in the past recognise that this be an extraordinary situation the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows clearly do not understand how prosecution be do in the uk sorry in england interruption well not in england in england the post office take the prosecution they never go through the cps in scotland they do actually go through the crown office and the advocate general that be the difference in term of where decision be take and the people who review case before they go to court the case be not similar that be absolutely right the key point be that there be no question about the post office be hold to account for the institutional level of cover up will the hon gentleman give way may just make the point and then will give way the post office must be hold to account for that institutional cover up and it be the responsibility of this place and the inquiry to look into that but the prosecution in scotland be take forward by the crown office which be responsible to the scottish parliament that be the point that be make about accountability would the hon gentleman agree that accountable for all of this be post office ltd which be wholly own by the uk government as its single shareholder and that the uk government take their eye off the ball do not follow through and take year to admit that there be problem in the first place and that if the uk government cause this they should fix it be happy to agree with the hon lady about the responsibility of post office ltd say that few moment ago but the prosecution base on that post office evidence be take forward by the crown office there be responsibility to go around here interruption will just answer the point if that be okay the evidence absolutely come from flawed system and post office ltd must be hold to account that do not deal with how prosecution in scotland be take forward not just on evidence from horizon but with corroboration from other source wonder whether the hon member share my distaste at some of the thing say in the chamber today include that we can not bring this legislation forward in parliament today because some of the postmaster in scotland might indeed be guilty of theft and that we have to tread carefully that bar have not be place on postmaster elsewhere in the uk would share that distaste but those comment be reflect what the lord advocate have say have letter from the lord advocate in my hand that repeat that point number of time of course the lord advocate sit around the cabinet table with think will need to check the current first minister humza yousaf will the hon member give way no have take lot of intervention and be go to make bit of progress my second point be about timing do not accept the snp argument at all that the timing be an issue have hear the minister make the point on number of occasion that the compensation regime will be available to people who have be exonerate by whatever mean that be at the moment they be exonerated so there be no question about that on the point about the scottish parliament not be able to rush through legislation it do not have the same process as the northern ireland assembly it do not have to go through lengthy consultation process so it could introduce bill tomorrow and have it pass before there be vote on any of the confidence motion on thursday indeed in the scottish parliament pass an emergency bill on covid considerably more difficult piece of legislation stretch to page in just two day and the idea that this bill be somehow more complicated than that be ridiculous there be no reason why the scottish parliament can not take responsibility and introduce bill now indeed if there be question about not be able to finalise the bill until the uk bill have pass the scottish parliament could take it all the way to the final amendment stage and amend it as necessary but actually again the minister have say that the scottish bill do not have to mirror directly the uk legislation for people to have access to the same compensation which be what the hon member for motherwell and wishaw and both want to see if the snp be unwilling to act in the scottish parliament to introduce the bill my colleague michael marra msp have already draft members bill and will introduce that bill this week rise if the snp be unable to act there will be no more

you in the chair dame rosie give the nature of this debate in move the government amendment will also use my speech to discuss the other amendment that have be table first will address the government amendment in the name of the secretary of state relate to northern ireland and to and to as well as new clause to be grateful to the house for agree to the government instruction motion to enable debate on these important amendment the government have listen carefully to representation across the house regard the extension of the bill to northern ireland we recognise the unique challenge face by the northern ireland executive in bring forward legislation to quash conviction to similar timeframe as the rest of the uk just want to put on record in committee the democratic unionist party sincere and personal appreciation of the minister for how he have engage with we the pragmatic way he have approach these issue and the can do attitude he have extend to northern ireland we have meet on number of occasion he have receive the thorough representation of my right hon friend the member for east antrim sammy wilson and colleague across the house not least ministers in the northern ireland executive we be indebted to he we recognise that this be huge step forward for the sub postmaster in northern ireland who feel there would not be light at the end of the tunnel he have extend the bill very purposefully for all those affect in northern ireland and we thank he for it be very grateful to the right hon gentleman for his kind word it be pleasure to work with he and his colleague from northern ireland we be always sympathetic to his argument and be delighted to have be able to move forward as we have follow on from my right hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson it be fair to say that week ago or even month ago the sub postmaster and sub postmistress in northern ireland have little hope today they have hope and that be due to the minister endeavour on their behalf push this issue and the government acceptance on behalf of the we would like to say big thank you to the minister and the government be very grateful the hon gentleman be right to address the point about the sub postmaster they be why we be here and why we be keen to act in this way we recognise that there be specific circumstance in northern ireland that would have delay the exoneration and compensation to those individual and that be why we be act as we be today it be always pleasure to work with he as have on many different issue over the year issue include the executive recent restoration and additional public consultation requirement which the house debate on second reading in decide to take this step the government recognise the extent of cross community support for the extension of the bill to northern ireland for those reason we have decide to put forward government amendment which would extend the scope of the bill to northern ireland be very grateful to have cross party support from member represent northern ireland constituency in co sign government amendment specifically the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson and for east antrim sammy wilson and the hon member for east londonderry mr campbell for strangford jim shannon for north antrim ian paisley for north down stephen farry for south antrim paul girvan for upper bann carla lockhart and for belfast south claire hanna the amendment which have be draft in consultation with the northern ireland executive empower the northern ireland department of justice to implement the legislation in the same way as the secretary of state will in england and wales the amendment would modify the criterion for the conviction which be overturn to ensure that the relevant conviction from northern ireland be capture within its scope specifically they would add those secure by the public prosecution service for northern ireland and refer to distinct northern ireland offence additionally this group of amendment would ensure that the relevant caution will be delete in northern ireland as they will be in england and wales the amendment have the same intent as new clause table by the hon member for north antrim so hope he will be happy to withdraw it on that basis on amendment in the name of the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne thank he for his continued engagement on the bill and on wide horizon matter it be vital that we stay true to our objective of bring justice to wrongly convict postmaster but it be also important to keep in mind the constitutionally sensitive nature of the bill we should legislate in way that respect the separation of power and the independence of the judiciary this amendment would widen the scope of the bill to include conviction that have be uphold by the court of appeal it would automatically quash such conviction thereby override decision take by the senior judiciary these case be exclude from the bill because the government believe that it should tread very carefully where judge in the senior appellate court have consider case on its merit we do not consider it appropriate for parliament to interfere with such decision be grateful to the minister for give way on this point and indeed for the way he be approach it the chairman of the justice committee send he an excellent letter last week in which he underline that almost all the witness before his committee agree that it be unfair for the bill to take restrictive approach in the way the minister have while take rather expansive approach elsewhere know the minister have write back to the chairman of the justice committee but his letter do not touch on this point wonder whether he will take the opportunity to wrap that up for we thank the right hon gentleman and my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill for their work we take these matter and the independence of the judiciary very seriously where the court of appeal have uphold conviction and declare it safe we think that be material concern there will always be different opinion in these area but we think we be strike the right balance between overturn conviction that we believe to be unsafe in the main and one that have be before senior judge too pay tribute to the minister for the extremely constructive way in which he have engage with everybody on this matter my initial position be entirely supportive of the government but must say that the evidence give to the justice committee cause to think again it be usually right to be very wary indeed about trespassing on decision make by the court however we have choose to do that because it be think desirable for the great good in respect of the bulk of conviction the point that need to be emphasise be that we have perhaps not appreciate that in case where conviction be uphold by the court of appeal it apply narrow test to the relevance of the horizon evidence in hamilton and related case it say that the test be whether the horizon evidence be essential to the conviction we do not apply that test as result of policy decision that could lead to bizarre situation whereby someone who do not get to the court of appeal because the criminal cases review commission do not refer the case would have their conviction quash whereas someone who the commission think have an arguable case and who go to the court of appeal but who be reject on narrow test than parliament be now create would not benefit from have their conviction quash that be the unfairness that we need to think little more about and it be the thrust of what the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne be get at there will of course always be different legal opinion on these matter as my hon and learn friend express he have have two different opinion on what we should do in this regard and know that his view be base on further submission of evidence that he have receive of course we consider these matter very carefully my right hon and learn friend the justice secretary be here and listen to my hon and learn friend comment we will always continue to reflect on this legislation to make sure that we be get to the right place but understand the point that he raise there be certainly difference of opinion as to the appropriateness of the measure as whole with dr quirk be in minority of three who take different view but there be not difference of opinion on the factual point that the test apply by the court of appeal in hamilton be different from that which be in statute that be matter of unanimity understand and accept that point but decision have to be take on whether to include these case there be definitely difference of legal opinion on that point because have have different representation make to we recognise that this approach may leave small number of individual concern about the way forward for their case in case where the court of appeal have uphold conviction the usual route of appeal remain available to they those affect can apply to the criminal cases review commission which can review their case the minister know that we on the advisory board have discuss this issue at length give what have come out of the inquiry over the last few week do he agree that there be evidence that may have bearing on some of these case accept why he do not want to include they in this bill but we need to look at some of these case to see whether there be ground for appeal of course and be listen intently to the evidence before the inquiry it be true to say there be some shocking revelation as the right hon gentleman illustrate in his work with the advisory board there be maliciousness about some of the prosecution which be of great concern as be the flawed horizon system part of the reason why we be legislate as we be reflect that but we will continue to look at the evidence that emerge if that be the approach that the minister be go to take could he tell the house bit more about how his department will support individual who find themselves in this egregious position as my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones say evidence will now have come to light that be not available to the court of appeal or indeed to court that may have refuse leave to appeal those individual will be in terrible state now what can his department do and on what timetable to support they through the process that he propose they take the right hon gentleman make the point himself as more evidence emerge it may be that the ccrc take different view of case that be bring forward people who have present their case can revisit they by make an application to the criminal cases review commission which can make recommendation as it see fit clearly we be happy to provide any information that we possess and the post office will do the same as say the inquiry revelation may bring information that would help in some case the ccrc may refer case to the court of appeal if it consider that there be real possibility that conviction would not be uphold with the constitutional sensitivity in mind hope the right hon member will agree to withdraw his amendment turn now to amendment and table in the name of the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill these amendment would require the secretary of state to include detail of available financial redress in notification to people who have have their conviction quash or caution delete by this bill the amendment come as part of number of recommendation by the business and trade committee to which the government have since provide our response can reassure the right hon gentleman and the whole committee that we will include information about redress in the notification that we send to postmaster when their conviction be overturn our aim be that the redress process will follow seamlessly from the process of overturn conviction there be no need to legislate for this those with caution may have already seek financial redress via the horizon shortfall scheme or the group litigation order scheme we will provide they with the necessary guidance to identify the appropriate route to claim financial redress if they have not do so already be grateful to the minister for clarify these point as we go along he will know that many sub postmaster have not apply for the full extent of their potential claim because they be unsure about the case law involve and understand that the department be use some guidance in make judgment for example the dyson judgment which be not publicly available for perfectly good reason there be bit of creativity go into how we solve this problem the post office write to last night to say that on the horizon scheme it be record the head of loss and the average of claim that be be agree which could be one of the way in which sub postmaster be give sense of what the tariff be could the minister say bit more about how we absolutely guarantee in the notification that we maximise the chance of sub postmaster claim the maximum possible amount that they should be entitle to we have try to design the scheme in conjunction with the legal firm that be advise most of the claimant on claim redress we will continue to work with they as we do with the advisory board and there be different mechanism that we can use to make this process simple more transparent and easy to navigate clearly case will differ despite similarity so if we go down the full assessment route it be important that all claim be assess individually which obviously take time if there be mechanism that we can use for example the tariff that the right hon gentleman describe to expedite the process we would be happy to look at they we will continue to work with the advisory board on that the government will provide more general guidance on the redress scheme in due course would be more than happy to consider any recommendation that the right hon gentleman or the committee make we do not believe at this point that there be need to legislate for that very much hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment amendment and also in the right hon gentleman name be worthy amendment and share the sentiment behind they we all want postmaster to get redress as quickly as possible but we do not believe that these amendment be the right way to ensure that the scheme have already be expedite base on our learning and experience over the last few week and month in the group litigation order scheme run by the department for business and trade we have commit to make first offer within working day of receive full claim in of case be delighted to tell the committee that we be now meet that target the figure have be slowly rise hope that it will continue to do so there will always be some claim of course that raise novel or difficult issue and those will take long than working day we will try to resolve they as quickly as possible we be explore what delivery target would be appropriate for the horizon compensation redress scheme as be announce to the house the scheme will deliver redress to those who have their conviction quash by this bill and the government will update the house in due course on the relevant target our goal will be prompt redress just as it be for the other horizon redress scheme the department response be not usually the problem as of april in the glo scheme we have make offer in response to full claim receive so we have just claim in hand the issue generally be the rate at which claim be come in we receive just between april and april we do not blame the claimant lawyer for that these claim be complex and need to be prepare properly however we be work with claimant representative to find way of speed up claim preparation the glo scheme be pilot fast track approach under which the level of forensic accounting analysis require be substantially reduce so far the pilot look to be work well and we be look to build on it in the come week we do not feel that we will speed up redress by legislate we need to deliver change at nitty gritty level and we be determined to do that with that assurance hope that the right hon gentleman will withdraw the amendment move on to government amendment and the bill take effect by quash conviction upon royal assent the amendment make it clear that the bill will not affect any conviction secure after that date that have always be the government intention we table the amendment to put it beyond doubt that the bill do not apply to any future conviction we must keep in mind the constitutionally sensitive nature of the bill and hope that the amendment reassure the committee about the exceptional nature of the legislation and the careful balance that we seek to achieve amendment in the name of my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill would introduce sunset clause to the bill we thank he for his amendment and for all the work that he and the justice committee have do in consider the bill and the issue that it raise would like to reassure he that the government share his concern that the bill should not be see as precedent for parliament act outside its usual constitutional role however this amendment be not necessary to achieve that aim the key action of this bill the quashing of the conviction for relevant offence in scope take place once and once only on the day when the bill come into force an expiry date be inherent in clause of the bill in effect it expire as soon as it come into force to put that beyond doubt the government have table amendment and which make it clear that the bill will not affect any conviction secure after royal assent however my hon and learn friend amendment would also sunset the other part of the bill include those set out the process for identify quash conviction those about notify individual that their conviction have be quash and crucially those about amend criminal record if the amendment be accept it would place time limit on postmaster ability to come forward and identify their conviction as be in scope of the bill and to have their record amend we could then be in situation where in say three year time an individual have have their conviction quash as matter of law but still have criminal record that would not give the victim of this scandal the justice that they deserve we be clear and there have be agreement across the house that this exceptional legislation do not set precedent have hop that my hon friend be go to speak to amendment as well just so pleased that we be go through the legislation today because it be so important for so many people have write to he about my constituent who come to see about her husband who be sub postmaster he have be write to by the post office who have tell he about his exceptional bookkeeping he then discover an unexplained loss in the amount he call the auditor they come in and they lock he out of his business they search his home they do not find any evidence but they take away his business his home his livelihood and his reputation we have hear that so many time the only difference be that this happen in under the precursor system to horizon amendment mention the pathway system my constituent be use something call capture fortunately the case be drop before it get to criminal court know that the minister be look at whether there be more of these capture case when the legislation come before the other place can we make sure that if need it can also quash any criminal conviction due to capture or other precursor system as well as horizon will speak to amendment write back to my right hon friend about her case and we be look at this be sure that the right hon member for north durham mr jones will have something to say about this issue we have agree to instigate an independent review of that software there be some fundamental difference for example it be not networked so no remote access be possible whereas that be major feature of the issue with horizon be happy to continue to engage with my right hon friend on the issue and congratulate she on the way she have deal with it on behalf of her constituent my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst amendment would also sunset other part of the bill this would not give victim of the scandal the justice that they deserve we be clear there have be agreement across this house on this that this exceptional legislation do not set precedent and hope especially with the reassurance provide by government amendment and that he will withdraw amendment understand where the minister be come from and of course he have provide deal of reassurance but want to test this little be we really assume that it will be necessary to leave open end people ability to come forward to have their conviction quash after all if they can not reasonably be trace there be provision for the secretary of state to notify an appropriate person for example if we can not find the person or their next of kin if they be dead there be catch all provision about notify an appropriate person why could that not include the criminal record body would they not be notify anyway just wonder why we have to leave the provision open end to that extent there will come point when the provision have be exhaust also be interested in how my hon friend envisage process work through which people can get document that show that their conviction be quash for example if they need visa or work permit or have to undergo disclosure and barring service check as say the legislation expire on the day that the provision be bring into effect my hon and learn friend be talk about the ongoing marking of the record of people who may come forward at future date we do not know what that date would be be happy to have conversation with he about what the cut off would be but the effect of this legislation in term of quash conviction expire on the day it receive royal assent understand that and can see my hon friend point hence the two amendment my point be that he be pray in aid as another reason for not have sunset clause the provision for notify people about apply to have their conviction quash what be the mechanism to make sure that do not hang around indefinitely we will eventually want to bring thing to conclusion not only get conviction quash but quite separately pay out the compensation fund one day all the compensation that can be claim will have be claim what do we do then how do we wrap up the process that be what it come down to as say be happy to have continue conversation with my hon and learn friend on that point feel that it would be serious injustice if we set say three year cut off period and somebody come along day later those be the challenge that we have to meet in way this be the core of the debate about where the four corner of the bill should stretch to the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill make very good point at some point there should be sunset on such unprecedented legislation at the moment there be no limit to its expansiveness in term of time but the minister have set limit on its expansiveness in term of the individual involve because he be rule out those who have go through the court of appeal the bill would benefit from further discussion perhaps in the other place about precisely where the four corner should be pin down would welcome that discussion and will follow it closely in the other place the controversial element of this unprecedented exceptional legislation be the overturning of the conviction because we be interfere with the court by legislate in this way the conviction expire on day one all that happen far on from that be the marking of the record which be not the controversial part the controversial part be the interference with the court again be happy to have continue conversation with the right hon gentleman new clause in the name of the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael would require the establishment of an independent intermediary body to administer financial redress to individual whose conviction be quash by the bill also acknowledge the business and trade committee recommendation on similar point assure the committee that we be build independence into the process of make financial redress final decision will if necessary be make by an independent panel comprise king counsel an accountant and retail expert the panel will have case manager who will ensure that case be settle fairly swiftly and in non adversarial manner have be clear throughout my work that we should put the victim of the scandal back in the position that they would have be in and that we should move as quickly as possible we feel that it would take month to set up an independent intermediary and that it would add additional step to the process and risk create unnecessary bureaucracy if my new clause have be select for debate would probably not seek to press it be not in position to do anything more but thank the minister for his assurance on independence as the new clause be not select we probably should not be discuss it my apology dame rosie will move on with pleasure penultimately turn to new clause thank the right hon member for north durham for all his work seek justice for the former sub postmaster and indeed on the horizon compensation advisory board my official have be work closely with he as have and he will be aware that we have set in train the process of appoint an independent forensic investigator to look into the capture software now that the post office have address concern about it obviously this relate to my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford who be no long in her place this follow on from the useful meeting that the right hon member for north durham and have with sub postmaster and his wife who want to talk to about his experience my official have speak to other affected sub postmaster too new clause would require the secretary of state to make statement within day of royal assent as the committee know we aim to complete the bill passage very quickly so statement may be due quite soon in practice we feel it would be too soon and time be need to identify and appoint the right person for this role and for the investigator to complete their work and offer an independent conclusion however be happy to promise two thing first once the investigator have report will certainly make statement to the house secondly as the work progress will continue to engage fully with the right hon gentleman and his advisory board colleague hope this will encourage he not to press new clause finally on amendment be happy to reassure the right hon gentleman that the current scope of the bill include the pathway system which be horizon pilot the condition in clause that determine which conviction will be overturn by the bill be draft with this in mind condition in clause specify the date between which an alleged offence must have be commit the date be deliberately align with the roll out of pathway which we understand from the post office to have begin on september condition in clause provide that the horizon system must have be in use at the post office concern clause define the horizon system as any version other than the current one hng it follow that as pilot of an early version of horizon pathway be cover hence we be clear that the bill already cater for pathway and change to the drafting be not necessary hope the right hon gentleman be therefore content not to press amendment clause mention september be the minister say that any icl pathway system instal in post office even prior to that date will be capture by the bill certainly if we regard it as pilot system of horizon that would be the case as draft so be the date irrelevant have speak to one person whose prosecution might have be but there be evidence that the pathway system be in place before that date in that be not what we understand from the post office but be happy to continue our discussion as always do to make sure that every relevant person affect by horizon or its pilot system be cover rise order before call the next speaker remind the committee that this debate have to finish at know some of the point be very detailed but be conscious that have the four member who be stand and the shadow minister to get in colleague should bear that in mind because can not impose time limit it be about make sure that everyone have chance to speak thank you dame rosie it be privilege to serve under your chairmanship will be very brief because some of my point have be cover through intervention there have be good progress since the bill be publish which be testament to the minister leadership and his official support as my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones say the more that we have hear in the inquiry and through the medium since the bill publication the more horrified and more determined we have become to hold individual include the former chief executive of the post office to account it be pretty clear to many of we that the evidence she give to the select committee on february and june have be flatly contradict by the channel revelation that be publish on march hope the select committee will be able to bring option for the house to consider as soon as possible wish to touch on three point quickly the speed of redress the stress of redress and the scope of this scheme the point about speed be light up by single fact the total budget for compensation be about billion but as of last wednesday million have be pay out the implication of that be that of the compensation budget have not be pay out after all this time and all the heartbreak trauma and scandal this bill will correct that imbalance substantially about million of the budget be earmark for overturn conviction and this bill allow we to move that money much fast however remain concerned by what the minister say today about the lack of any service level agreement for pay more out for the overturning conviction scheme would have expect timetable for pay out that redress alongside this bill today we should be concern about that because the track record of make payment be not good for example if we look at the claim in the horizon shortfall scheme submit by the original deadline in november three and half year ago we see that people have still not be pay which be sixth of applicant if we look at the late claim all of they we see that three quarter of they have not be pay that be why the select committee look hard at how we could introduce some stricture to ensure that people be pay much fast since then my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones who have more experience in this house than pretty much anybody else and indeed the minister raise serious and wise concern about the risk of put legally bind deadline on the entire timetable have listen to those concern with care which be why the way that my amendment on this have be draft take aim at one part of the process the timeframe between legitimate claim be submit and first offer be make the minister target be four week and we be get close to that now but the reality be that significant number of people be still not be pay within that timeframe in some of the anonymise evidence the minister provide to the committee we can see that of claimant in the glo scheme be wait more than day with wait more than day if my amendment as have draft they be not right and still run risk appeal to the other place to work hard on this to ensure that there be some legally bind stricture on the department that mean that when god forbid the minister be no long in his position and we do not have his emollience and tenacity to rely on his successor whoever that may be be bind by some kind of timeframe that ensure we be not still have this debate in year to come to check the point contact number of select committee witness this morning and find that there be some evidence that the speed of claim be improve however new issue be emerge be tell that the time take to table second offer when the first be reject be frankly not fast enough there have be delay of up to three month or more in offer date through remediation hearing so the process be still run too slow if have fail to persuade the committee today appeal to the other place to help we to find some legal mechanism to ensure that there be stiff timetable to which the department must adhere my second point be about the stress that many people will face when put claim in many people will not put claim in because legal assistance be not available before the claim be submit many people such as christopher head be go out of their way to provide pro bono assistance to people in put claim together but often it will take hour and hour of work to get claim form in and many people simply will not be up for that as they do not have the patience and they want to put this behind they they certainly will not have the legal assistance available to they that be why hope the department will consider publish some kind of tariff to help people ensure that they be claim for the full amount the minister may well say that there be risk that people will then under claim but check that with some of the lawyer this morning their response be express in rather unparliamentary language be afraid dame rosie but the upshot be that such an objection be utter nonsense know that lot of thought be go on in the department about the way to do this and welcome the letter from the post office publishing average offer around the head of loss that have be set out obviously there will be banding that be more appropriate and perhaps that be way to publish these thing obviously there be judgment the department be rely on the dyson judgment and the neutral evaluation which be not publicly available for good reason however my plea to the minister be this let we try to make much clear to claimant the full measure of redress that they should have available if there be issue in people need extra help before the claim form be put in please let we make sure that that help be available right at the beginning of the stage and not simply make available once the claim be in and contest be under way about what should be pay my final point be about scope which we have already get into there be case for the government to think again about the case that have already go to the court of appeal and be refuse or be not give leave to appeal the good evidence for that be the chair of the justice committee excellent letter in which he say the bill be in effect treat case where the ccrc have credible evidence that horizon datum might have be essential to the prosecution case less favourably than those that the ccrc consider have no credible evidence and therefore no basis upon which to refer to the court of appeal that be an extremely important point can see what the minister be try to do he be conjure here with very radical legal remedy and that be not something we want to be expansive but the risk we be run be that we leave an injustice that take year and year to work through he have address some of the point the chair of the justice committee make in his letter but he have not address that one in writing the objection and the goal of my amendment still stand will not press my amendment to vote because we be try to maximise the spirit of collegiate working accept that my amendment particularly on the issue of speed may not yet be at the state of perfection that they would satisfy everyone in the committee especially those member with more experience of work on these case than have however the problem be there people be not be pay fast enough they be not be supply with the right amount of information up front at the beginning of their claim and the scope of the bill have be draw too narrowly look forward to work with the other place to try to get amendment in place that can improve the bill and commend the consent of member from all party too hope that can be brief dame rosie because we have cover deal of the ground in the intervention however wish to make few short additional point to those that have already be ventilate they be all contain in the transcript of the evidence of the justice committee hear with four distinguished witness three senior academic lawyer and in mr rozenberg kc arguably the most distinguished legal journalist of recent time interestingly the government will perhaps take comfort from the thought that three of those distinguished witness be prepare despite some of my misgiving to say that this may be the least bad way of deal with the position equally however all of they think that more thing need to be do with the bill which be what ask the minister to bear in mind be grateful to the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne for refer to the letter that write to the secretary of state on april it broadly encompass what think be the key point and hope that the secretary of state will be able to respond in writing so that we can then publish that in addition to the transcript of our evidence and the letter for completeness of the record before the bill go to the other house come to the other issue we flag up small but perhaps important one relate to the condition that must be meet before the conviction can potentially be quash in particular condition in clause require the offence to have be commit in connection with carry on or work for the purpose of the post office business the government explanatory note say that the provision of the bill be intend to be unambiguous but the debate we have in the justice committee suggest that there be potential ambiguity there take for example the position of post office worker who during the course of the operation of the horizon system be convict of theft of stock for personal gain be that in the scope of the bill or not it be not in relation to deficiency in reality that mean that the secretary of state will have to be advise by official perfectly properly as to whether any individual case come within the scheme and therefore within the scope of the requirement of clause some judgment will have to be make and it would be interesting to know on what basis in particular if the advice be that the conviction in an individual case do not meet the statutory condition and therefore the secretary of state do not notify the convict court of the detail of the conviction and it be quash will there be mechanism for anyone affect to seek reconsideration that be relevant because in some case those conviction may have be make on the basis of guilty plea perhaps in the magistrate court and we do not necessarily know what the factual basis in the magistrate court of the guilty plea will be because unlike in the crown court that will not necessarily be record in the transcript it be small but technical point but if we be go to have an expansive approach perhaps that can be look at as the bill progress it do not alter the basic principle but it might prevent an intended injustice arise we have talk already about the position of conviction that have go to the court of appeal on the basis of the evidence hear have rather shift my ground on principle my initial response be to be as restrictive as possible on interfere with decision of the court but once we have go to the extent that we have as matter of policy in this house to adopt more expansive approach there be potential risk of injustice for comparatively small but important number of people whose case be consider by the court but be reject the difference between the test in the scheme of the bill and the test set out by the court of appeal in the case of hamilton and other and subsequent litigation be really important the court of appeal adopt fairly classic and restrictive construction as to whether the horizon evidence be essential to the conviction as we have already say this house have decide to take more expansive approach in what it consider to be the broad public interest if that be the case some technical issue may arise from case go to the court of appeal that be not fully capture the chair of the justice committee be make brilliant speech the minister characterise the decision and the conundrum here as legal conundrum but in way it be in fact political conundrum because we be take political decision about the where the scope of the scheme should start and stop do the hon and learn gentleman have any insight into how long it might take those who be currently leave out of the scheme to secure justice if we do not amend the bill to improve the scope the right hon gentleman be right about the policy choice that ultimately give rise to this issue pray in aid quotation from dr hannah quirk who of all the witness who give evidence to the justice committee be the most sceptical but she concede in reference to people whose case have go to the court of appeal if we be take an expansive approach it seem unfair to exclude they the court of appeal might have be apply different criterion at that stage the full extent of the scandal have not come to light that be an important point to bear in mind the court of appeal would have be consider mixture of evidence and law at that stage professor chalmers who have also be mention say obviously think it be unreasonable can certainly see the argument for case from hamilton onwards but if someone have appeal at the time when the problem with horizon be not document it seem to to be entirely unfair to exclude they from the act on that basis do the hon and learn gentleman agree that much have come out since those case be look at the public inquiry evidence about the way the post office investigate those case show that text book aggressive style be use in every case that have an impact on some sub postmaster plead guilty when they be not and in the way in which some of they be harangue to the court the right hon gentleman make perfectly fair point that be why hope we can find formula to revisit this issue as the bill make progress give the expansive policy decision the house have take do not think any great extra constitutional outrage be cause by include those who have be to the court of appeal within scope it be rather as keynes say when the fact change change my mind what do you do sir as the right hon gentleman point out the fact may well have change there may be an alternative formulation to that set out in amendment it might be that provision could be add to the bill be think almost de bene esse at the moment when it go to the other house to automatically mandate the criminal cases review commission to refer those case at the moment someone be require to go to the ccrc to seek the reopening of their case and apply to the court of appeal for leave to appeal out of time if the case have be dismiss and for it then to be reconsider as the lady chief justice say in evidence to the justice committee have no doubt that the court of appeal would move very swiftly if that be to occur she be very clear on that point but there have to be trigger mechanism which be absent at the moment to come back to the point make by the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill the current working process of the ccrc could not guarantee speed some provision to mandate the ccrc to refer such case swiftly might be means of achieve justice without upset any more constitutional apple cart perhaps that be the sort of discussion we could usefully have as the bill go forward point link to that be the position of someone who have appeal notice that clause set out the various circumstance in determine when conviction have be consider by the court of appeal clause say one such circumstance be where single judge of the court of appeal have refuse to give leave to appeal against the conviction and leave to appeal have not be give by the court of appeal thereafter people can appeal the single judge leave to the full court but that do not always happen the point to make there be that although in some case we do not know suspicion be strongly raise by witness to the justice committee that the single judge may have refuse leave simply on the ground that an appeal be out of time because there be strict time limit on bring an appeal if that have be the case because it never get to the full court the single judge and the full court would never have consider the merit leave would have be refuse purely on the basis that technically the case be out of time and there be no evidence put forward to justify at that stage why there should be granting of leave to go beyond time again that might have be because the full fact of the scandal be not yet know would hope that that sort of anomaly could be address without too much difficulty dame eleanor hope constructive thing can still be do on the margin to improve the bill in relation to those matter and as the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill rightly say to get the shape of the bill into proper form will not press my amendment because we want to take thing forward constructively but hope that the minister in the exceptionally helpful spirit that he have adopt throughout will continue to engage with those of we who whatever our misgiving realise that this be route that the house have choose to take we want to get it work to the good possible extent for those who have be affect by this horrendous scandal that will lead to ramification in the prosecutorial process the disclosure process and many other thing beyond first may declare my interest as member of the horizon compensation advisory board and take some responsibility for why we be here today it be the advisory board that recommend this course of action but this suggestion be down to the tenacity of the minister and of the law officers who he work with closely when the idea be first mute at the advisory board we think that possibly this would not be acceptable to the government but the persuasive power of the minister who have come to admire clearly work their magic within government none the less this be the only path to take many individual would not have come forward without this approach which the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill have describe as unique may also put it on the record that be pleased that the northern ireland case have be include in the scope of the legislation although there be only small number it would have be wrong to have hold they up through no fault of their own because of the way that the consultation have take place again congratulate all party in northern ireland on how they have come together to take this united position for the victim let refer to amendment and the icl pathway although the minister have give some assurance on this let explain why table the amendment icl pathway be introduce in and the purpose of my amendment be to get some clarification on it it be stand alone pilot but the legislation refer to the horizon pilot be quite convince by the minister assurance that this will be in the scope of this legislation that be important because there be number of individual certainly in the north east of england who use the icl pathway it be not call the horizon pilot at that stage who be subsequently prosecute and will now be bring into the remit of the bill that be important because it will mean that at least one individual have meet who originally think they would not be include in this legislation will be let turn now to new clause on the capture case the minister will not be surprised that have table this clause because give the anorak that be in term of the horizon scandal think we have potentially discover another scandal that predate horizon for the benefit of the committee would like to provide little bit of background as the minister say early capture be very different from horizon it be develop by the post office itself from onwards and it be not linked or networked system like horizon it be sell as quick way of produce cash account quickly and accurately it be computer base system but be not network and it be quite clear that there be huge trouble with it generate shortfall with each upgrade of the software new bug seem to have grow on the system accord to the analysis that have be do on the upgrade the post office identify at least bug in the capture software once we have the publicity around the horizon scandal lot of people come forward and talk about experience shortfall include someone go to visit in the north east who describe exactly their experience with the post office initially think well this be horizon case it involve computer and the aggressive way in the way the post office prosecute that individual but it be only when look at the date that realise that they do not match up it could not be horizon or icl pathway because it be before then since then from today think because the right hon member for chelmsford vicky ford have raise another case have come forward we be talk about long time ago so lot of these individual will have sadly pass away but more people be come forward hear of someone this week who be now on the other side of the world they have move away from this country because they have be make bankrupt by the post office the scandal be that the post office know about the problem with the system will come on to how discover all this think the minister must realise that have more evidence than the actual post office have about this scheme the post office be helpfully send out newsletter say that there be bug in the system one would have think that that would have set alarm bell ring in the post office to say that when there be shortfall at post office use capture people should not be prosecute but it just carry on do it in it send out letter to the north east postmaster claim that more than have be prosecute for false accounting over the previous six year again no alarm bell seem to ring in the post office over why suddenly it have all these kleptomaniac work for it it use the same aggressive approach in its investigation as those we have hear about at the horizon public inquiry in term of audit and argue that the computer could not be wrong want to raise the individual case of june tooby from bishop auckland in the north east in she be suspend after shortfall be discover in her account and ultimately her contract be terminate in court she raise the possibility that the capture system could be to blame for the shortfall in her sub post office post office lawyer argue that this could not be the case one investigator say have no reason to believe the computer be faulty again this come to the point about judge include in the horizon case be not one to attack judge but in this case the judge just accept that almost pooh poohe the case say that the computer be always right clearly it be not the post office also say that these fault just seem to be appear sadly june die in but in many way she be still with we she be remarkable woman would have love to have meet she she keep everything include the full transcript not only of her trial but of her interview with the post office investigator as well as transcript of tap telephone conversation that she have with the post office more importantly she keep the old floppy disk and all the operating manual to go with the capture system basically what we have be full example of capture case which be something that the post office do not have pay tribute to june husband ken tooby and vivian her niece who have keep all of this and very helpfully supply it to it come in large box and it have take long time to go through it all also pay tribute to my assistant ryan jackson who spend long time read all of this and differentiate between what be and be not relevant we have be work with simon recaldin from the post office and we have pass copy on to the department which think now have all the information it be full case and do not think that the post office have anything that compare with it if we change the name on the document to horizon they would be the mirror image of horizon case give the way in which the prosecution be carry out dismiss the idea that the computer system could be wrong be pleased have work with the minister official and with the minister himself that he have agree to have an independent expert look at the disc and the evidence to clarify what happen steve marston and steve lewis be two other individual who have come forward and be helpful certainly steve marston have in try to show that the floppy disc create problem as say capture be roll out nearly year ago many people will have pass away it be important that we get justice for people suggest to the minister that individual affect by capture could be include in the bill for exoneration accept why he can not do that but if we get clarification if we get independent expert advice that the computer system be wrong and on the other evidence that have produce before the bill pass through the other place perhaps we could add capture the minister be right that we need that independent verification if it be not possible to add capture we will have to find some other mechanism to get justice for those individual to be fair to the minister think he be committed to look at that there may well be other individual out there who have not yet come forward the right hon member for chelmsford raise case appeal to anybody out there who have such involvement with the capture system to please come forward if any right hon and hon member have such case please feed they through to the bill be unusual as the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst say but think it have get the balance right the chair of the business and trade committee know my reservation about put time limit on compensation have sit on the advisory board and see the difficulty of deal with some of the case to the minister credit offer fix sum award have help to move some case on very quickly some however be very difficult just by their nature do not think that anyone want they to go on for long than they should some of the proposal that think the minister will announce follow our board meeting last week will help to speed up the process understand the nervousness around court of appeal case not be include in the bill we need to find mechanism for deal with such case give what have come out of the inquiry in the past few week evidence be now in the public domain that possibly be not available to people when they bring their case forward accept that some part of the judiciary feel nervous about the approach the minister the justice committee and the business and trade committee need to sit down with government law officer to look at way in which we can at least look at some of those case once the inquiry be complete think we will have full picture of not only the investigatory side but the decision make process have to say have hear from senior people in the post office this past week it seem to be that they can not remember but that be no defence it be important that we do not forget about such case will not press my amendment to vote but hopefully we can ensure that we get justice for not only those individual affect by horizon but those affect by capture who fall outside the scope of the bill at the moment like other member will not speak for very long in this instance actually mean that will speak to new clause in my name and those of my colleague and new clause and in the name of the secretary of state and my colleague the minister will really have an opportunity to dine out on all the thank and gratitude it be not give lightly he have show something that the public constantly tell we be absent from this place honour he have be completely honourable with the people of northern ireland in this matter whenever my right hon friend the members for east antrim sammy wilson and for belfast east gavin robinson raise the matter in the chamber they consistently ask for northern ireland to be include from day one the minister be consistent in say that he would use his good endeavour to do that sometimes we hear those word and it be only acknowledge in the breach but he be absolutely clear that he be go to do it there be up and down in the process but every effort be make to ensure that on cross party cross ministerial and cross legal jurisdiction basis the consistent message come back to the minister that this be the way to resolve the issue accept the instruction this evening be clear indication that that would happen new clause be now superfluous to requirement it have be incorporate in the government own new clause we welcome that and thank the government for it sub postmaster across northern ireland will know that they be be treat exactly the same with the same opportunity for fairness and to receive compensation as their colleague in england and wales hope it be not inappropriate to thank the clerks office really want to draw attention to how frankly brilliant they be in help we to ensure that new clause be draft correctly that make it easy for the government team to then accept what we have table without the clerks help we would not have be as successful it be only appropriate to acknowledge that know from speak to some of the victim that they be extremely grateful they be wind up bit from time to time by the medium who tell they northern ireland be be exclude you not go to get it even after we have the commitment from the minister thankfully tonight postmaster in northern ireland will see justice and thank he for that will therefore not press new clause in my name it can not be repeat often enough that the horizon scandal remain one of the great miscarriage of justice our nation have experience it be scandal characterise by abuse of power the mistreatment of innocent people and the wholesale failure of the entire system we might blame it on failure of it but that be not the whole story it be human failure on grand scale failure to listen and failure to learn it be failure by the powerful to listen to sub postmaster and it have have catastrophic cost in reputation income and suffering on hard work innocent sub postmaster and their loved one sub postmaster be people we rely on at the heart of our community the people who serve we help we and hold our community together without the tireless campaigning of people such as alan bates the relentless effort of parliamentarian across the house and the work of journalist and filmmaker perhaps justice would have never be do to they pay tribute and extend my gratitude to the minister for the work that he have do from the front bench as well as from the back benches we have hear horrific story of sub postmaster who take their own life because of the suffering and story of shame pain and suffering for sub postmaster as well as their family and friend labour support this unprecedented bill and we believe that it must pass into law with the necessary urgency give the gravity of the situation this have be say already but it be crucial that this bill should not set precedent it be an exception we must understand the weight of this action so that it be never even consider again the legal solution in this bill be wholly exceptional and isolated case these necessary action be be take to match miscarriage of justice unprecedented in both scale and impact the bill must not set precedent we welcome the inclusion of northern ireland in the territorial scope of the bill thank the minister for listen to the representation make across the board about get the northern ireland element into the bill know it will be significant relief to the sub postmaster in northern ireland who be wrongly convict the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne which he have speak to seek to clarify the position on compensation and the expedite process for those exonerate of course for the victim of this scandal the quashing of their conviction must be swiftly follow by further compensation it would surely rub salt in the wound to quash conviction after all these year and then to have delay beyond reasonable time in the payment of compensation give everything that have happen it be right that the minister should be in position to set out explicitly in more detail how the government will ensure that the compensation be deliver without further delay my right hon friend set out very clearly the reason behind the amendment he table he have agree to withdraw it but what he say be important and very much hope that the minister will heed the point he have make there be of course complex case in the exoneration process and we do not want deadline that may have unintended consequence as my right hon friend acknowledge however we must act with urgency and speed to ensure that delay have no further part in this already long process which have cause so much suffering to victim as the inquiry roll on more and more horrifying story be emerge more story of cover up obfuscation dirty trick and shameful culture at one of our old institution today legislation be seismic but it be only part of the story know ministers recognise the wide work that be need to ensure that sub postmaster get the justice they deserve want to touch on those wide point that the minister be think about and work on and to put they on the record for example question about the requirement to sign non disclosure agreement be expose in last week hearing in relation to mr griffiths who tragically take his own life as result of the pressure that the horizon scandal put on he the widow be encourage by the post office to sign an nda it be important that minister think about the implication of such issue my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones set out the ongoing concern about capture welcome the minister clarification on the pathway scheme but it be crucial that we ensure that action be take welcome his recent announcement on capture and we look forward to see progress as speedily as possible this be outside the scope of the bill but it be helpful that the government be focus on ensure that fujitsu contribute to the compensation plan give that public money in the order of billion have be commit to it and that fujitsu have continue to receive government contract worth billion since alongside this legislation which be vital and which we support it be critical that the government work at pace to address the wide issue in the post office its leadership and management and their failure and abuse of power which have be expose by this scandal so that it be fit for purpose we look forward to work to ensure that that happen will tackle the point that have be make as briefly as possible the chair of the business and trade committee the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne be right to say that million have be pay out so far this legislation will open the door to lot more compensation and it should go out rapidly to victim of prosecution also we expect that number to rise significantly with the introduction of the fix sum award of for horizon shortfall scheme claimant to be clear around of claim submit in time have be settle follow the final settlement for those individual so we be make progress but we be determined to make more certainly we be work with the horizon compensation advisory board to ensure that that be the case we be very happy to get into the weed and nitty gritty of this we do that daily the right hon gentleman say that for whatever reason may not always be the minister with this brief be very happy to help whoever take over the brief when that happen should more help be need yes we be keen to accelerate the timescale right across the piece for the glo scheme as say we be hit our target of make of first offer within day but we will come forward with more service level agreement for other scheme be very happy to work alongside the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill on that be grateful for that reassurance do the minister think that he will have the service level agreement for the overturn conviction scheme on the table before the bill be send for royal assent yes the right hon gentleman ask about tariff we be keen to do whatever we can to make the process quick easy clear and more transparent we be take that away and look at it right now of course legal advice be available prior to the submission of claim to the horizon overturn conviction and compensation scheme as it be in the glo it be only in the hss which be see as non adversarial that that do not apply prior to the offer be make but legal advice be available after that point we be obviously keen to continue discuss the case that be before the court of appeal we will certainly respond in due course to the letter from the chair of the justice committee my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill be grateful to the minister for take final intervention it be maybe non adversarial process but it be none the less an intimidate one that involve complicated page form that take several hour to fill in that be the equivalent of several thousand pound worth of legal assistance at the moment such assistance be be provide pro bono by those with some experience but hope that the minister will look at the matter again be happy to look at that should point out that lot of the page form be legalese only about four page of it be actually stuff that need to be fill in but understand the right hon gentleman point and the advisory board have make recommendation for an independent appeal process for this scheme as well which we be look at thank my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst for his work on the issue with the justice committee agree that what be before we be the least bad option and be glad that the legal fraternity be come to the same opinion we will respond to his letter of april particularly on the court of appeal case there be case seven before the court of appeal and six that have be refuse leave to appeal and be very happy to look at they and to continue our conversation understand the potential injustice around those case we will also have look at his point about subsection of clause to make sure that there be no unintended consequence from the legislation thank the right hon member for north durham mr jones for all his work on the advisory board he have talk about my persuasive power think the itv series be far more persuasive than be in move thing on and get we to where we be today but certainly follow his recommendation which be make before the series air we be look at way to expedite the overturning of conviction and some of the bill be base on those recommendation as say we be look at the capture software through the independent review we have both meet with mr and mrs marston and their story like many other be compelling the right hon gentleman raise the issue of the date range which be deal with in subsection of clause under which the offence have to have take place between december and the later date if an offence be commit at an early date it would be exclude under the legislation we need conversation with the right hon gentleman about that but the independent review should inform our debate go forward it be easy to include horizon than other thing that be not directly connect to horizon as the court have find conviction unsafe on the basis of horizon evidence that be why we be able to legislate in this way thank the hon member for north antrim ian paisley for his kind word it be important to recognise that all of we be here to do the right thing and it be pleasure to have the opportunity to do so in this way on cross party basis we be very pleased to be able to agree with the dup wish that northern ireland be include in the legislation particularly for the sake of the postmaster in northern ireland who have suffer as result of post office action also thank the shadow minister the hon member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali and her front bench colleague for their support we be very keen to make sure that fujitsu contribute it have agree to do so and have moral obligation to do so my secretary of state who have be massively supportive of all my work on these issue have meet fujitsu global chief executive officer and we expect to provide more news to the house in due course with that commend the government

will need no reminder of the significance of this bill this legislation will hope bring some much need relief and closure to those catch up in one of the great miscarriage of justice in our nation history for the postmaster wrongfully accuse of and convict and punish for crime they never commit this bill mean hard won exoneration with their conviction wipe clean from the slate wrong be finally be put right but as hon member know these postmaster will also receive the fair compensation they deserve through the horizon conviction redress scheme this will be deliver by my department rather than the post office while the scale of the government response in this case be extraordinary be keen to remind hon member that it do not set precedent for our involvement in other judicial matter know this sentiment have be echo across this house during debate on the bill we have choose this path because the sheer extent of the post office prosecutorial misconduct be an affront to justice in and of itself it demand an exceptional response from government that be why be glad to see this bill be welcome on both side of the house on second reading there be believe unanimous consensus that the provision of this legislation be need to bring justice to postmaster who have suffer too much for far too long be sorry to intervene on third reading the secretary of state be talk about justice for postmaster and mistress which be completely right but want to ask one question about the policy aspect of this and other member have have postmaster who have write to we who have not be prosecute but find that the horizon system be work badly and have to top up out of their own money when horizon be report loss due to fault in the system what be their redress route if they be now say be hundred of pound out of pocket because be have to make up the difference we have devise the horizon shortfall scheme to deal with those specific situation and if my hon friend write to the department we can look at some of the case bring to he as constituency mp know the debate to date have centre around call to extend the bill to northern ireland and the government have be supportive of they so in consultation with the northern ireland executive be pleased to see the government amendment in my name accept by the committee of the whole house as result of the house support postmaster in northern ireland who suffer the same injustice as those in the rest of the uk will now also see their good name restore with proper financial redress as have be note during recent debate the speed of that redress could not be more important because of the horizon scandal people lose more than just their job they be pursue for non existent loss they rack up legal bill and they suffer enormous financial and personal strain because of the post office action it be therefore entirely right that victim do not wait second long than necessary to have that money pay back to they with interest to reflect what they have lose be determined that this legislation complement the ongoing work to hasten redress across the exist scheme here we be already make good progress with payment allow postmaster to finally move on with their life would like to take this opportunity to thank the opposition especially the hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds for his constructive and supportive approach to work with the government on this bill and so many member across the house who have engage with we over and again to deliver the right result for postmaster would also like to thank the official of both my department business and trade and the ministry of justice who have be work hard behind the scene for some time to ensure that postmaster affect by the horizon scandal be support and compensate fairly but most of all thank my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake for his exemplary work as post office minister and in take through this bill and deal with the issue in very sensitive manner and help to create confidence in the scheme this bill be major step forward in that mission after year of campaigning and fight to clear their name postmaster be now receive the justice they deserve no bill can fully undo the damage that have be do or remove the scar the horizon scandal have leave on its victim but through this legislation we be do our good to right the wrong of the past so that every postmaster catch up in this scandal can begin to rebuild their life commend the bill to the house thank the minister and the secretary of state for their remark today bill as have be acknowledge provide an important step forward in bring justice for sub postmaster they have suffer more than we can imagine as the secretary of state have point out that have include unjust prison sentence bankruptcy ostracisation from community family breakdown and homelessness tragically the scandal have lead to some sub postmaster take their own life today by no means make amend for what they have be through and the suffer their family have endure but it be an important positive step we welcome as have say previously the fact that today bill will bring particular relief for the northern ireland case and ensure that they receive exoneration the many story we have hear of those affect whether in this debate or in previous statement and debate be just snapshot of the scale of suffer that the horizon scandal have cause it have be scandal define by the abuse of power secrecy and delay as other have acknowledge we have see the inquiry reveal yet more challenge and yet more issue whether those relate to the case refer to today non disclosure agreement the speed with which action be take the particular abuse that we have see or much else while this bill have particular focus it will not be enough as say early welcome the action the minister be take to address the concern on capture welcome the clarification he have make on pathway and the assurance he have give to member on both side of the house on the speed of provide the necessary compensation and on ensure that this bill remain unique provision give the unique and extraordinary situation that sub postmaster have experience and the injustice they have face we look forward to see progress on the action that will be take to deliver the compensation that sub postmaster desperately need we look forward to work with the government to make sure that the post office be fit for purpose because frankly what we have see from this scandal and what have be uncover over the period that the post office have preside over it and its implication have expose major failing that we urgently need to address we must ensure that the institution be fit for purpose that further scandal do not hit that institution and that more people do not suffer what we have see do not inspire confidence and action must be take look forward to work with ministers to help achieve that be pleased to give this bill my support and that of my party on third reading it show what be possible when the house come together and work collegiately as we have do it must surely remain concern to we all that it be necessary in the first place pay warm tribute to the minister for how he have handle this matter not just as minister but in his time before he come into office as well as to the right hon member for north durham mr jones and the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows although she be not in her place at the moment would say only that hope that the scottish government can bring to the scottish parliament the legislation that have be prepare so that we can all come to the same place at the same time because the important thing here we have to come back to this time and again be the outcome for the sub postmaster themselves for the post office as an institution this be an important step in restore its trust and its standing in the community that we all represent leave the house with this final thought there be temptation to think that when the bill pass and its provision be implement somehow or other that be it job do caution the house against that we be here tonight because of head of steam that be build up because of the nature of the post office as an institution the standing of sub postmaster in our community the sheer number of case and the remarkable way in which the itv programme catch the mood of the nation what happen to sub postmaster be different from what happen to people all the time only in one respect the sheer scale of it in my time as member of parliament have come across so many example of people with good reasonable case who be squeeze out of what they be entitle to because of the inequality of arm public body have deep pocket the taxpayer be behind they every step of the way to pay for the good legal representation and to stonewall in case where people would otherwise have good justice will be back in westminster hall on wednesday morning to deal with case about the accountability of the financial conduct authority where it act in respect of claim make by constituent of mine who have be the victim of ponzi scheme only because it be eventually force into do so by people who as with the post office be brave enough to take their case to court ultimately they lose but in the process of take their case to court they put the fca in position where there be no alternative but to pay out to all the victim through the financial service compensation scheme the brave people who take the legal action in the first place be leave million out of pocket everybody get something because they be brave enough to stand up but they be leave to pay at the end of it that might be the law madam deputy speaker but you will never persuade that it be justice like other who have speak indicate the democratic unionist party full support for the bill at third reading the secretary of state be kind enough to thank the minister as she be not present to hear all our tribute to he throughout the course of the evening want to repeat they for her benefit the minister have thoughtfully and doggedly work through the issue on the inclusion of northern ireland we be incredibly grateful to he he use to sidle up to weekly and suggest something else that need to do to allow he to advance the case for inclusion and every time satisfy what he have ask of he present another challenge and then another he request that speak with people who be really uncontactable for politician because they be too impartial for such work but my colleague and genuinely appreciate the way in which he have engage with we tribute be pay to the northern ireland executive and the way in which they have engage in this issue but as the party leader it would be remiss of not to put on record my appreciation for the work of my right hon friend the member for east antrim sammy wilson who take an interest in the issue long before the restoration of the northern ireland executive he have recognise the deep injustice that have be at the heart of the horizon scandal and doggedly pursue resolution and justice for those affect in northern ireland our friend the right hon member for north durham mr jones have always be champion for northern ireland inclusion in the legislation we be grateful not just for his interest in we but for his commitment to the issue over many year and the thoughtful way in which he have engage in it it serve to prove the impact that back benchers can have in the parliamentary process that there be no frailty to the pursuit that we have though we may not have sufficiency of number to provide the opposition in and of ourselves we have be able through effective relationship to ensure positive progress in the bill however that can work only if there be reciprocation for that throughout the course of the last week and month and long relationship on other issue we be grateful this be historic unique and very controversial bill it be another small step in the justice for sub postmaster campaign which have be go on for decade pay tribute to alan bates and all his campaigner they say no to the people who be tell they to go away they keep at it and they be the hero in all this pay tribute to the fellow member of the advisory board professor chris hodges richard moorhead and james arbuthnot we propose this solution for overturn conviction but do we expect it to be accept no we do not that be down to the minister work also want to put on record my thank to the attorney general and justice secretary both of whom not only engage with the argument but see the logic of this controversial way of do it the only way of do it without their help it could not have be do let put on record my thank to the minister long suffer official they have to put up with not just he but and the other advisory board member they work tremendously hard on this as do the official in the ministry of justice we be into civil service bash again this week but must say that without they we could not have achieve what we have in this bill hear what the minister say on the issue around capture hopefully give the constructive way in which he have approach the issue we can get justice for those affect finally our thought should be with all those people who be no long with we such as tom brown my constituent who originally get involve in this scandal june tooby forensic cataloguing of the capture case will hopefully lead to some justice for those victim too this be an important step forward let we hope that it give family some comfort to know that their love one will be exonerate as part of this process let also put on record my thank to the minister for his work on this issue first come across it when witness the anger frustration and despair of people who know that they have do no wrong yet have their reputation sully lose their business and face the suspicion of their friend and even their family they feel that they be beat their head against brick wall of bureaucracy they be against people who have stand and who be believe regardless of the evidence that mount against the case that they be make the minister have do great thing by give hope and exoneration to people many of whom feel that they would never get justice now they have find it the minister know about the scandal before he take his position and he make it clear at the very start that he intend to see this through he have use his position to do good thing it be important to recognise that this place have be the vehicle by which justice have be deliver committed minister be determined to use his position to do the right thing for individual when the issue of northern ireland be first raise with the minister there be reluctance there be no doubt about it when put question to he on the floor of the house and in my conversation with he there be always reason why legislation should be introduce in northern ireland here be good thing the argument be listen to over time as my right hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson say the minister do not just roll over he expect we to do something as well and make the case that be the job be thankful for the fact that he listen and that northern ireland be include thank the clerk for his advice many of we be not really aware of all the parliamentary procedure even though we have be here for do not know how long we do not always know the good of way of go about thing the advice and the support that be give be very important in get this over the line unfortunately even though people will be exonerate as result of this legislation there be many who die with this shadow on they and with the shame of what be do to they by people who as the inquiry now show be cynical manipulative and calculate in how they pursue they through the court this be not for debate today but hope that once the inquiry be over there will be accountability for those who knowingly put sub postmaster through this quite apart from the embarrassment some have have during the inquiry when they have forget matter show arrogance or claim that they be just do their job as say some sub postmaster die without their name ever be clear we can do nothing about that but hope that their family will at least feel some reassurance as result of this legislation once the bill pass into law sub postmaster will be exonerate from legal point of view but hope that the compensation that they be due will be pay out quickly the minister outline some of the way he intend to ensure that compensation claim be deal with quickly hope that they be hope that other ministers learn from this experience do not forget that even when the evidence be pile up and the issue have be point out and suddenly sub postmaster and sub mistress across the country be common thief ministers turn blind eye or accept the explanation give by their official as mention at the very start the frustration that people feel when the state deny they justice or tell they that they have do something that they have not cause they to have no confidence at all in government and its institution we could go through number of issue look at the evidence that be build up on the loan charge ask myself whether in five year time we will find the same kind of issue there with programme put in place and ministers embarrassed and unable to explain why they do not take action when all the evidence be there hope minister take heed of this sorry tale in which they believe people in power rather than the victim of those in power be elect in and be an mp of just few month stand when my constituent seema misra approach say that she have just be sentence to jail she be pregnant and her sentence come down on her son birthday with the help of james arbuthnot now in the other place within few day realise that there be other colleague who have similar case and it all point to the horizon system write to the post office minister at the time and be rebuff there must have be other colleague who do the same thing back bencher of just few month standing be able to see right to the heart of the problem with the help of the internet and couple of fantastic colleague yet minister of the crown be not now ministers in our system have surgery order this be not second read speech we be at the very end of the bill and the hon gentleman should be make an intervention but that be very much speech we all have sympathy with the point he be make but this be not the time in the proceeding when such point be make believe that the right hon member for east antrim be just about to conclude the entire debate on the entire bill be indeed but the intervention show that ministers need to listen pay tribute to the right hon member for north durham mr jones for give we great support for the case of northern ireland and to other who persist in raise this issue know that lot have be say about the tv programme but even before it air there be realisation because of the persistence of members that something have to be do be glad it have be do and hope that this will be great relief to many people who have live under the shadow and the cloud of the thing that happen to they over number of year question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass business

who also staff the parliamentary contributory pension fund we be very grateful for their support and for the support of trustee the only thing would say hope do not put myself in contest with other trustee be that the sum take from our monthly salary be still very small at some stage in the very near future it should be incumbent on this house to look at more generous monthly contribution from

scilly motion make and question propose that this house do now morrissey thank mr speaker for grant this debate on the cost of education for family on the isles of scilly have yet to stand up in this chamber unless it be to raise an issue that have be raise directly with by constituent and today be no exception rise to raise an issue that have be raise by not just one but several constituent they be all parent and they meet last month to set out their concern the isles of scilly be unique in so many way they be situate just off land end and they be beautiful part of the uk and fantastic part of my constituency have often speak in this chamber about the unique environment on the island but the people of scilly also face unique challenge or almost unique as prepare for this debate find that there be in fact two local authority area in this country with no sixth form provision one be the isles of scilly the other be the city of london so the situation be not unique the consequence however be young people in the city of london can walk to sixth form college or pay for bus ride the bus be rarely cancel because of stormy weather or high sea and unlike the scillonian ferry they run all year round more to the point those young people can go home to their family at the end of each school day that option be not open to the family meet on scilly they know that they have to send their young people to stay on the mainland to fulfil the statutory requirement but as one of my constituent tell the decision about where to go be base on accommodation not educational preference the lucky one could stay with family or friend on the mainland should perhaps say the lucky one if the council unofficial survey be accurate but everyone else have to choose between stay with host family or in boarding school last year ofsted report on scilly child service state to access education child must live away from home on the mainland this add the potential for social emotional and mental health challenge and additional safeguarding risk for some child it be not surprising but still shocking that of and year old from scilly be not in education employment or training which be four time the national average and infinitely more than the city of london this be despite the fact that student from the isles of scilly consistently outperform student on the mainland in gcse attainment the council of the isles of scilly be responsible for the provision of compulsory education until the age of and like all local authority be expect to meet the cost of delivery from its own budget the council be support by travel and accommodation grant administer by the education and skills funding agency the funding be currently per student which can go towards travel to and from the mainland and accommodation while study the actual cost be considerably more and be grateful to the parent of current student who have prepare very helpful figure that show just how much more they have to fork out for their child education commend the hon gentleman for secure this debate do he feel it be immoral and wrong for parent to have to pay for their child education when sixth form education be free across the rest of this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland it be wrong that the parent and child of the scilly isles can not have the same advantage as we have elsewhere thank the hon gentleman for his intervention will be cover that injustice and how equality and levelling up really should apply but be pleased to know that there be someone else in the chamber who also take an interest in the isles of scilly appreciate that they be not everyone area of interest or expertise but they be beautiful remote island be sure they be holiday destination for many but visitor do not always consider the challenge that people face as be say the cheap option for sixth former be stay with host family but even this cost more than the grant and it be increase that be without factor in the cost of travel with six return journey year include transport on the mainland cost for each student on average this do not include contingency for overnight stay when travel be disrupt despite the high risk of the weather scupper travel plan and this weather disruption be not limit to the winter everyone in the chamber will appreciate the difficulty of find accommodation in wonderful destination like penzance at the peak of the tourist season there be obvious safeguarding issue with young people stay on their own when their journey be disrupt many parent be understandably reluctant to entrust their child to host family who be currently unregulated at an age when most young people be live with their parent and year old from scilly be live in dig they lack the structure and support they need in the absence of family and friend some host become like second family but other parent have chilling story one constituent tell that their child become very ill while live in host family accommodation nobody be aware because nobody have pastoral oversight nobody notice the student lose stone over six week half term and he end up with one level have start do five with top grade prediction there be other case where vulnerability loneliness isolation and naivety have place student at risk that can not of course divulge in such debate college such as truro and penwith college our excellent further education college in west cornwall and the main provider for scilly have concern they see how often this lack of support be reflect in poor attendance and work at school and it can lead to student fail to complete their study accord to the informal survey mention less than two third of child attend education complete their course successfully although college take seriously the challenge face student who be require to leave scilly to learn their pastoral care be limit to their statutory role which cover only the school day outside that period which may be only hour during typical school week student be leave to their own device they may not have access to the support and extracurricular activity such as sport and social club that young people take for grant in the rest of the country for all those reason homestay be become less popular with family on scilly nearly half of student do this just three year ago but now just over quarter do the other option available to family be boarding school where these young people have supervision and support there be number of state boarding school in the south west but as be hint at in the intervention although the education be free the board and lodging be not accord to the parent figure the shortfall can be as much as include travel cost per child again that do not include contingency or incidental expense many student never see their sixth form until they arrive for the first time in september as the cost of visit beforehand be not cover by the grant and be just not achievable the cost of living be already high on scilly because of freight cost and salary be low than average yet family on scilly be force to pay for their and year old to have the same opportunity as anyone else furthermore when their child have finish their level and be think about high education family be already saddle with debt and reluctant to take on more be aware that the department for education be already review the policy on scilly education but it be my understanding that robust equality impact assessment have not yet be undertake by government it be however clear that family on scilly do not have an equal access to education the isles of scilly council with which have be work closely on this issue have suggest grant of per student per year be require to ensure financial parity with those on the mainland and to meet the additional increase cost to enable the student to continue in their education or training would be grateful if the minister could confirm that he will direct his official in the education and skills funding agency to take scilly unique challenge into consideration when assess the size of the grant and to hasten decision as the next academic year be just four month away and decision about the next stage of child education be need to be make imminently when correspond with the minister predecessor my right hon friend the member for harlow robert halfon he make the point that young people all over the country have option to study in diverse and widespread location and it would not be financially feasible for local authority to fund all the cost this involve but family on scilly do not have option they have straight choice between send their child to potentially unsafe environment or rack up thousand of pound in debt number of parent tell they be consider leave scilly purely so that it be financially feasible to educate their child as the law require the one thing everyone on scilly would like to say to this house be that when family leave it become difficult to maintain the service and all the thing that be require to keep community of about people viable and go on remote island setting such as scilly the cohort over the next few year fluctuate from to student so submit to the minister that it be not financially infeasible for the department for education to look seriously at the figure of that the council have identify we know that money allocate for scilly in the government levelling up fund be not now go to be spend as intend this would be an ideal opportunity for the government to show their commitment to these unique island and to their future as thriving community although the subject of this debate be the cost of education to family on scilly there be wide issue about how to ensure the welfare and wellbeing of scilly young people so they can fully and appropriately engage with their education the council need the capacity to commission package of support for student on the mainland where it be necessary that could be through bespoke package enable they to return to mainstream tuition after period of absence or through the future foundations programme which as the minister will know empower student to aim high and achieve their potential the council aim to work with the multi academy trust of which the five islands academy be member to provide opportunity for student to engage in extra curricular activity it also want to work with voluntary organisation such as action for children and young people cornwall to improve the offer for student outside the hour of formal education as have hint there need to be some money set aside for contingency these be not outlandish request all the officer at the council of the isles of scilly want be to enable student to remain safe in an unfamiliar environment to remain gainfully and safely occupy outside the time of formal education to have and to maintain good mental health and wellbeing and to thrive socially emotionally and academically these be not unique requirement they be what we all want for our child and young people there be no reason why parent on scilly should not want the same look forward to the minister comment on how he plan to ensure that the family on scilly can have the same congratulate my hon friend the member for st ives derek thomas on secure this debate on the extremely important subject of education on the isles of scilly while they be beautiful place appreciate the argument he make that resident face number of different issue and challenge because of the size location and population of the isle he be passionate advocate for they in this house my hon friend clearly and eloquently set out one such challenge there be no education for young people on the isle the people of the isle be extremely fortunate to have he bat for they in the house today and make that case so strongly from what he have describe many parent face difficult decision about the next step in their child education young people have to face the difficult situation of go to the mainland for education and training opportunity as he say that involve travel and live away from home at relatively young age which must be extremely daunting and create number of challenge he set out eloquently and with force the emotional and wellbeing issue that young people on the isle face that set of issue be no doubt difficult for parent and young people and after listen to my hon friend strong argument sympathise with they all young people in the isle in common with those across england have to continue in education and training until they be young people can choose to participate in full time education have job or volunteer combine with part time study or can undertake work base training such as an apprenticeship the government provide funding for range of education and training opportunity for young people continue in education and training mean that young people be give the opportunity to develop skill and qualification that open door for they to future employment help they to make the most of their potential and to earn more over the course of their lifetime empower young people to gain the skill they need to climb that ladder of opportunity into successful career or further study be top priority for we at the department for education and across wide government it be to the immense credit of all the resident on the isles of scilly that they be determined to overcome all the unique and challenging barrier they face so that their child can continue into education and training at that point they have many more diverse challenge than those on the mainland include challenge access the benefit and opportunity that people on the mainland often enjoy to support our commitment to ensure young people across england wherever they live get high quality educational opportunity we be boost funding by an extra billion in compare to the financial year we make further investment of million in and million in overall in the academic year nearly billion be allocate to institution in programme funding for education to help ensure that every young person have access to an excellent education young learner in cornwall include learner from the isle will benefit from that extra funding through receive high quality teaching and learn experience in high quality facility the department provide range of financial support for student who need it include those from the isles of scilly to enable they to participate in education that include free meal and bursary to help with the cost of education whether that be travel book equipment or trip plus support for childcare and residential cost where require student can speak to their education institution about access those fund we of course recognise as be powerfully articulate just now the unique situation of young people from the isles of scilly and understand that the normal provision of funding in education do not fully fit with their circumstance on the isle in addition to receive full funding for their learning like other young learner across the country for many year we have provide extra fund to help they meet the cost of travel to and from the mainland and for accommodation on the mainland where they be stay in the current year as my hon friend have say the per student funding be increase by more than be now the number of student have grow which mean that we have increase the total quantum of funding by more than this year compare with last year but my hon friend have make powerful case that family on the island believe that the current level of per student be not sufficient and should be increase as say the figure have increase by from last year but do understand the point my hon friend make about the challenge that family face with increase cost and particularly with the reduce availability of host family accommodation they feel that this funding do not cover the total cost of support for their child to travel for their education know my hon friend and his constituent feel extremely strongly about the issue so we will consider carefully any request from the council to provide additional funding for the scheme as part of the spending review my hon friend have make that case eloquently and as the minister responsible will be watch the matter closely be very happy to meet he and perhaps his council to talk about the proposal in more detail at the appropriate time because understand the point he have make and the pressure and challenge face by family in his community my hon friend also raise the issue of student wellbee he speak powerfully about the health and wellbeing of young people who be under and live away from home and about the impact on they appreciate that student from the isles of scilly and their parent need to make difficult choice about where they live when they study we hear that some family decide to place young people with host family on the mainland while some opt to take more expensive option such as state boarding school agree with my hon friend that that be not situation that lot of parent want to see their family in and understand the concern he have raise as parent myself feel it very keenly when he make that argument know that the council publish model accommodation agreement for student and their parent to ensure that the accommodation option be safe include make sure that any adult within host family that child be place with undergo disclosure and barring service check the college also provide general support for their student wellbee include help with stress and anxiety and advice and support on study and career as we know this situation be unique one it be important that student and family feel that the accommodation and travel arrangement be safe and secure and help they to succeed in their education that be why we keep the scheme arrangement under review my official be in regular contact with the local council about how it be work but my hon friend have make his point powerfully and well and be very happy to discuss the matter far my hon friend also talk about education and training opportunity he be right to raise that point the council estimate think he quote this number in his speech that there be around student age to who will take part in education or training this year of course cohort of that size make it difficult at this stage to deliver face to face education on the isle themselves because of all the logistical challenge that it would create to undertake face to face education young learner have to travel to the mainland there be number of sixth form college sixth form and other option think he reference couple in his speech but the most popular be truro and penwith college and cornwall college which between they provide range of provision those provider offer wide variety of option with the college work increasingly well together to avoid duplication of the offer to student from the isles of scilly and to ensure that the wide variety of high quality option be available to learner in the area include those from the isle it be of course not ideal that learner from the isle have to travel so far and live away from home despite the support that be available and all the help with cost that the college provide my hon friend speak passionately about that and about the collective challenge this be not just challenge about education there be lot of different element of life for people on the isle and this be just one challenge they face that point be make very well assure my hon friend that we be open to consider other approach if parent and education institute have workable alternative for example if some course could be access via distance rather than face to face learning be very happy to have that conversation my hon friend have make strong case know that he have raise the issue before and that he be strong advocate for reform and do more in this area thank he for bring this debate to the floor of the house he make some important point about education for young people on the isles of scilly and the difficulty that both they and their family face with the provision of this type of education and access to these opportunity it be clear that student from the isle be in quite unique situation in this regard and no doubt range of other appreciate the challenge they face we will keep the scheme arrangement under review my official and be in regular contact with the council on the isle and will listen to any other suggestion or alternative that the council or my hon friend wish to talk through pay tribute once more to the people of the isles of scilly it be huge credit to they that they be determined to overcome all the logistical challenge they face in try to access education and training like many other people across the country through my hon friend tireless campaigning he be ensure that the issue be be hear at the top of government and very much thank he for it question put and agree to house adjourn
