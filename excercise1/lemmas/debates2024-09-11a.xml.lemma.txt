labour government it be only through that growth that we can achieve the sort of improvement in our public service that we need that be the only way that we will attract the secure job and dynamic workforce of the future too many of our young people be stick in generational cycle of worklessness which hold back entire family because of lack of opportunity skill connectivity and actually confidence we will only truly grow as country when people in place like ours feel that growth touch they when prosperity reach the doorstep of our terrace when we break the cycle and say if you have the will we will give you the way no one leave behind in my time here hope to represent to the good of my ability those value and ambition at this juncture as be tradition pay tribute to my

live by be make no little plan fred be streetfighter who more than anything else be willing to do what be need to achieve something that many other have consider impossible get money out of the treasury allegedly he insist on construct the outer road of milton keynes first make it hard for the budget to be cut later scheme that those work on wish they have think of he also once march into whitehall on christmas eve and refuse to leave until his budget be approve just mention to the government front bench that those be tactic will not rule out use in the future laughter for member across the chamber who have shamefully not yet visit milton keynes what fred and his team build be nothing short of masterpiece at time when family right across our country be live in substandard

resident and at its peak family be move in every single day in just few decade what be once vision on planner desk have transform into one of the uk most dynamic economic powerhouse today we be home

alongside those be our beautiful lake river and canal every child include grow up within five minute walk of park or green space it be say that plant tree be one of the great act of altruism we dig we plant seed and with that small act we shape the world for many generation to come fred roche and the team plant more than fair few tree in fact milton keynes boast over million tree more than per person but would argue that build new town be an even great act of altruism fred pass away few year before be bear but stand here today as member of the first generation that truly benefit from his vision thank to fred design my young parent be able to scrape together enough to raise and my brother in spacious house with its own back garden the dream of home ownership become reality for they provide we with the security and stability need for the good start in life the park and green space they create back then may one day be enjoy by my own child now will not pretend that we do not have our share of challenge one will work tirelessly to address in this place but milton keynes be build on that new town promise of good job public service that be there when you need they and most importantly affordable and high quality new home it be place that give the opportunity so that could one day be stand here give my maiden speech in the house of commons mention that because in my short time in politic have notice that too often people search for excuse to oppose new development there be view or have be view that it be more politically convenient to be voice that yell no rather than voice that search for way to say yes and while the acronym nimby may be modern invention the sentiment be not glance through hansard of the and we find countless example of opposition to the building of my hometown but there be consequence to that short term political thinking if it be not for fred and the milton keynes development corporation team ambition back by the labour government the two bed end of terrace that my brother and grow up in would never have exist as proud son of milton keynes can think of no mission more important for this new government than to build the new town and new home that this country need it will require we to embrace the spirit of fred roche visionary unyielde in the face of opposition and make no little plan but it will allow we to build future where every child in britain have the opportunity to thrive in home and community that nurture their potential as mine do for congratulate everyone on their maiden speech it be privilege to follow my hon friend the members for calder valley josh fenton glynn for burnley oliver ryan for milton keynes north chris curtis and for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward and the hon member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune for guildford zöe franklin and for chippenham sarah gibson represent the new constituency of penrith and solway which take in part of the old carlisle copeland workington and penrith and the border constituency therefore follow some truly great parliamentarian willie whitelaw pillar of strength behind the thatcher government david maclean lord blencathra who now excel in the tradition of likeable nuisance in the other place baroness sue hayman champion of farming and rural affair whose skill will be put to good use on the labour benches sir tony cunningham family friend my father fine mentor rory stewart who now entertain members at least on the labour benches dr neil hudson who have be re elect as the member for epping forest and mark jenkinson who represent workington from to may have profoundly disagree with he but must confess that he work hard for his constituent find myself slightly in awe at those member whose predecessor have disappear into the sunset will be see mine on regular basis but promise to take any advice from they with grace like the hon member for epping forest dr hudson have the privilege of represent constituency in which grow up my grandfather bring my family to cumbria in the and his work as an engineer see he on the platform for the opening of calder hall the world first full scale commercial nuclear power station my family love of cumbria and the lake district have endure ever since have have the pleasure of represent my home of keswick on town and district council and more recently on the new cumberland unitary authority step down from that council know that my former colleague will do their good to ensure that challenging local government reorganisation be success as begin my time in this place leave behind my work in the electrical contracting industry and my career as contract manager role that see work with many people in leasehold block management it therefore seem apt that make my maiden speech in this important debate as former electrician it be not lose on that the tragic event that unfold at grenfell tower be trigger by an electrical fault it be now imperative that the sequence of event that follow set the ground for long last reform that ensure these thing can never happen again commend the decision to create the building safety regulator with its focus on high risk building while many member rightly push for reform of the leasehold system and extend the right to manage hope the new regulator act as defence against those whose only concern be keep build management cost down winston churchill once say if you put two economist in room you get two opinion unless one of they be lord keynes in which case you get three opinion when it come to the interpretation of british standard affect electrical safety and fire safety my view be that if you put two electrician in room you will get two opinion but if you put the bill payer in the room with they you will only get one the regulator should ensure that any new rule be unambiguous and can be apply consistently have hear number of maiden speech and do not wish to get into the unwinnable debate about whose constituency be the most beautiful will just take it as give that my constituency that take in the solway coast national landscape part of the north pennines national landscape and not least the north lake district include the borrowdale valley for which have deep love be undoubtedly in the top however the real beauty of my constituency be not in its architecture coastline lake or hill it be in the people when be first elect as councillor be take aside by an experienced and recently retire parish clerk who have message for it be politician who run thing around here it be the community she be right be in constant awe of the tireless effort that volunteer show in my community every day the mountain rescue team who keep we safe on the fell the maryport rescue volunteer who run the independent lifeboat
