prayer mr speaker in the chair may remind the house that this be the final performance of the clerk of the house this be the last time we will see he at the table but we wish you well john and do enjoy your new role oral answers to questions energy security and net zero the secretary of state be ask contract for difference scheme what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the contract for difference scheme in support low carbon electricity generation what assessment she have make of the potential implication of the outcome of the contract for difference allocation round on the future development of float offshore wind welcome the secretary of state our contract for difference scheme be uk success story have contract more than gw of capacity include gw of offshore wind since deliver record number of clean energy project enough to power the equivalent of million home and the government commitment to offshore wind remain unchanged which be gw by welcome my right hon friend to her place the great advantage of the cfd scheme be that with forward planning it have the flexibility to adapt to change economic condition can she therefore confirm that the government will be work collaboratively and straightaway with industry to ensure successful round so that offshore wind can get back on track and uk consumer and the uk economy can benefit from low cost low carbon energy thank my hon friend for his long stand support in this area and can confirm that we be waste no time in engage the sector in advance of personally speak to offshore wind stakeholder follow and confirm our commitment the minister for energy security and net zero hold roundtable with the sector on september we be listen to the sector and annual auction mean we can respond quickly question please know that as chair of the all party group on the celtic sea my hon friend be long stand supporter of offshore wind we have announce that will open in march and we have publish an indicative timetable we be support research and development in float wind technology via the float offshore wind demonstration programme announce up to million in capital grant funding can we work to the order as it be group question the question should not be answer in that way selaine saxby should be ask direct question thank you mr speaker be keen to understand well what more can be do to assist float offshore wind in follow what happen in know my hon friend be long stand supporter of offshore wind we have announce that will open in march and we have publish that timetable we be support float wind technology through different programme and manufacture investment scheme too call the chair of the energy security and net zero committee we also welcome the secretary of state to the dispatch box with many renewable project build on the strength of contract for difference but with report of many not invoke these contract and instead benefit from the high energy price can the contract in principle be invoke later when price fall or could the government enforce the invoking of the cfd contract now at the start of the generation of these project rather than their take the high price while they can the cfd programme have drive price down over time to enormous effect by since they start which be much more than people expect would be happy to take the hon gentleman particular point away but overall this be successful programme and our annual auction change will also make difference give the unreliable and intermittent nature of both solar and wind generate energy we already have more of these project than the grid can efficiently manage do the secretary of state agree that what we really need be more reliable baseload capacity and that that can only be deliver via fossil fuel or nuclear we have strong focus on energy security and that mean have just transition to clean energy but also invest in nuclear the hon gentleman may have see that we have start the capital raise for sizewell and we support the oil and gas industry as just transition fuel call the shadow secretary of state wish the clerk of the house well in the future and warmly welcome the secretary of state to her new role and congratulate she on her appointment to the cabinet look forward to work together let we start with the truth the offshore wind auction that she inherit be totally avoidable disaster it mean another lose year for our country and another year of high bill and it be because ministers obstinately refuse to listen to warn after warn from industry renewableuk estimate that the auction failure will add billion to bill what be the secretary of state estimate of the cost to family of this fiasco thank the right hon gentleman for welcome to my place be delighted to serve opposite he and face he at the dispatch box there be couple of thing will point out if we have try to do what the right hon gentleman suggest we would have delay the gw of clean energy that we secure which be able to power million home if we want to look at what be go to hurt people and their bill would point to his disastrous policy whether it be the ultra low emission zone which be hit people who can least afford it or his borrowing spree which will raise inflation be afraid the secretary of state be quite wrong about that because ireland adjust the price and have gw of offshore wind let we talk about the way that this government be jeopardise our energy security they have order mr stuart know this be the last day before the recess and you be excited to get some freedom but let save it this government have deliver the bad cost of live crisis in generation there be pattern here they ban onshore wind and raise bill they slash energy efficiency and raise bill and now they have trash offshore wind raise bill that be why we be so exposed know that the right hon lady do not make those decision but now that she be the secretary of state she need to tell we after year of failure what be she go to do differently let tell the right hon gentleman about the last year we have decarbonise fast than any country while also grow the economy we have grow renewable energy from of our electricity when labour leave power to now be proud of what we have achieve over the last year we have proud record when it come to climate change and proud record when it come to renewable energy and be proud to defend it we now come to the snp spokesperson welcome the secretary of state to her new role wish could have welcome she to her new role on september when we have the remain stage of the energy bill but she be not here wish could have welcome she on september for the urgent question on the auction round strike price but she be not here for that either so what have the new secretary of state be do in the midst of the chronic energy crisis face our constituent and allow her department to see shovel ready offshore wind go into abeyance what have she be do struggle to see how that be directly relate to the question but let tell the hon gentleman what have be do be here for the third reading of the energy bill perhaps he be not during this time have be move forward with all the government priority on energy security and ensure that we can move to just clean transition forgive if that rendition be not immediately recognisable in offshore wind project from auction round hope the department have learn some salutary lesson from this mess but it will be consumer who pick up the bill can ask the secretary of state for her personal intervention in pump storage to introduce cap and floor mechanism which industry have be clear be absolutely necessary to get this vital baseload energy source into position will she intervene personally and get that move because it be blow in the breeze just now be absolutely focused on get investment into offshore wind one of the first thing do after be speak to investor from across the board to make sure be listen to their concern and there be multiple thing they care about one be have certainty there be lot of welcome of the move to annual auction the other be connection to the grid will be look at all those thing and make sure we can get the investment the sector need carbon capture usage and storage what assessment she have make of the potential impact of carbon capture usage and storage technology on economic growth we have commit billion to the early deployment of carbon capture utilisation and storage which will deliver economic growth and decarbonisation of our industrial heartland our analysis have show that it could support up to job in and add up to billion to the economy by thank my right hon friend for her reply follow the commitment in power up britain to provide up to billion of funding for early deployment of ccus how do she intend to finance that support do she recognise that ccus funding need to be match by create competitive environment for private sector investment include carbon border adjustment mechanism to smooth the path to deployment as recommend by the commission for carbon competitiveness of which be member welcome my hon friend work as member of the commission for carbon competitiveness and she make an excellent point the billion will be fund through variety of source and will be allocate in due course and early this year the government consult on range on measure to support decarbonisation include carbon border adjustment mechanism the government will provide response to that consultation in due course if the secretary of state be look for innovation that will make real difference to economic growth will she look at not only carbon capture and storage but hydrogen many of the same university and research establishment be look at hydrogen as the new energiser for transport and so much else in our life will she put some serious money into both hydrogen and ccs be interested in innovation in all of those area because that be what will get we to the ambitious target we have set out will be look at hydrogen carbon capture and every single other area to see what more we can do methane leaks from oil and gas production what plan she have to help tackle methane leak from oil and gas production the government have ambitious plan to tackle methane emission from oil and gas production with support from government and key regulator industry be on track to end routine flaring and venting prior to in line with the world bank initiative while welcome the government introduction of new oil and gas licence in the north sea as part of just and graduated transition to more reliance on renewable the minister will be aware that methane be far more warm gas than carbon dioxide give that much more can be do will the government look at how they can ensure that flaring venting and leak be fix by the new licence holder as and when they occur and in the context of the north sea transition plan ensure that the new affleck oil field be not allow to flare until as set out in the permission grant to it this be all part of how we can reach net zero without it cost my constituent the earth the north sea transition authority already expect methane emission to be as low as possible and all new development to be develop on the basis of zero routine flaring and venting and that they should be electrify or electrification ready of course what be require and will help facilitate that be new investment in the north sea facilitate by licence without which we be unlikely to see the reduction in emission that we have so successfully drive so far the minister have not really give any reassurance to the hon member for blackpool north and cleveleys paul maynard as we know methane be whopping time more powerful than carbon dioxide over year period so if the minister be serious about tackle this issue will he explain why the government fail to use the energy bill to ban flaring and venting why do they whip their own mps to vote against an amendment that would have outlaw it and give that the practice have be illegal in norway since the will he finally recognise that this make mockery of ministers claim about uk oil and gas being greener unusually the hon lady have get her fact wrong do not think that amendment be even select for debate that day accord to the north sea transition authority flaring be reduce by more than just last year contribute to reduction of nearly between and as have say the north sea transition authority estimate that methane emission have fall by more than to few than million tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent record low we have old exist infrastructure and be move with maximum of ambition to reduce emission and we have successful track record to date climate change committee progress report what assessment she have make of the implication for her department policy of the climate change committee progress report to parliament publish in june be grateful for the work of the climate change committee and pay tribute in particular to the commitment of its outgoing chair lord deben the government will respond to the committee report in october the late climate change committee report find that out of key indicator of government progress on tackle climate change just nine be on track accord to energy uk even before the disastrous offshore wind auction the uk be forecast to have the slow growth in low carbon electricity generation of the world eight large economy up to do the minister recognise that the government failure have cost every family in high bill our climate leadership be measurable and real we have reduce emission by more than any other major economy since we be the first to legislate for net zero we have eliminate coal which as late as produce nearly of our electricity supply the legacy of the labour party and we have lift renewable from to we have cut emission by more than other transform our energy system and we be lead on this issue internationally and domestically that be exactly what the government rely on in fulfil their aspiration to climate leadership do my right hon friend accept that one consequence of the climate change committee report be to increase our country reliance on chinese technology and raw material china have even great offshore wind capacity than ourselves it have the large wind and large solar capacity in the world and it have significant level of production we recognise that we will need technology from all over the world include china if we be to meet our net zero aspiration call the shadow minister accord to the climate change committee the private sector be be hold back by weak policy signal uncertainty and barrier to investment and perhaps we would not need to be so reliant on china if those issue be address just last month uk investor represent trillion in asset write to the prime minister warn that that could mean the uk miss out on million job will this zombie government listen to investor and their own adviser look at the game change intervention in the states and bring forward uk version of the inflation reduction act before it be too late to save british business and british job yet another unfunded spending commitment from the labour party the party that leave we with less than of our electricity come from renewable and that leave we reliant on coal party that want to nationalise the industry and drive out all those company that have transform the north sea basin lead the world in cut the cost of offshore wind and make we the european leader in offshore wind and the global leader in cut emission the labour party be the big enemy of net zero and the big enemy of the private investment in this country that will help we get there onshore wind industry what step she be take to help develop the onshore wind industry in england what step she be take to help develop the onshore wind industry in england the government recently announce change to national planning policy give great flexibility to local authority to respond to suitable opportunity for onshore wind the government also want community to benefit from host onshore wind and have consult on improve the current system of community benefit for england the truth be that the government have fail to properly lift the ban on onshore wind while bend over backwards to support expensive new oilfield and even give billion in tax break for those pollute project that ban have already add hundred of pound to people bill undermine the investment we need in the cheap form of energy and cost thousand of good green job will the minister not admit that the government failure to properly lift the ban on onshore wind will continue to keep bill higher and make we less energy secure more than gw of onshore wind be deploy in the uk in our allocation round just the other day we secure gw of onshore wind capacity allocation round secure gw it be extraordinary an industry domestic uk oil and gas have low emission than the alternative from abroad and employ people every one of whose job be at risk if the labour party ever get into power labour members be suggest that there be negative fiscal impact when that industry be expect to contribute billion over the next five year the labour party be an enemy of the transition to net zero and of british job and prosperity if the minister will not accept the argument of my hon friend the member for leeds east richard burgon will he at least listen to industry which describe the recent announcement on onshore wind as miss opportunity to end the ban renewableuk say the propose change do go far enough and would not make up for eight year of lost progress when will the minister listen to industry and lift the ban properly so that we can cut bill on september the government announce change to national planning policy for onshore wind in england give great flexibility to allocate suitable area and to address the planning impact of onshore wind agree with the hon lady be an enthusiast for more onshore wind where it go with the grain of community and we will continue to pursue that to make sure that we can realise the benefit that come from it call the shadow minister the minister will know although he unaccountably do not tell we that there be precisely no new onshore wind in england in the recent the minister claim that the late compromise wording which he allude to will lift the ban on onshore wind but he know really that that be not so and he know what the industry have be say about it and why it will not invest for the future the result be no new onshore wind get build in the medium term high bill for family and less energy security for the country why will his department not just face down his luddite back benchers introduce fair planning regulation for onshore wind and get the industry restart across england as have just say we announce change as recently as september like the hon gentleman look forward to positive future for onshore wind in england as well as in the rest of the united kingdom uyghur region solar industry source what assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of the report by sheffield hallam university entitle over expose uyghur region exposure assessment for solar industry source publish in august the government be determined to ensure that our energy system be not dependent on force labour at home or abroad the supply chain and innovation sub group of the solar taskforce be therefore consider this issue as top priority start by welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her place what conversation have my hon friend the minister have with the foreign commonwealth and development office and the department for business and trade on eradicate force labour from our supply chain do he agree that we must ban the bad offend company from our shore will he therefore lead cross government effort to take action on tackle slave labour in our supply chain just as germany america and the eu already have do my hon friend know that this issue be top priority for the government and for range of tool can be use to tackle force labour in global supply chain the government continue to keep our policy response under close review and we be work closely with our partner include at the united nations to hold china to account for its egregious human right violation in xinjiang we have already take robust action introduce new guidance on the risk of do business in xinjiang enhance export control and introduce financial penalty under the modern slavery act thank the minister for that answer as chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief commend the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns on raise this matter for freedom of religious belief in china be paramount and should be priority for the government think it be to make it happen we need clear legislation in this place and real power from this government and we need to be assure that no company that use force labour in china can have its product sell in this country again seek confirmation from the minister that that serious strong will be there concur very much with the hon gentleman view on this matter the government be determined to ensure that our energy system be not dependent on force labour as say we be continue to work with international partner to do what we can to hold china to account for its egregious human right violation and to work with the solar industry to see what we can do to weed out force labour and ensure that it be not part of that supply chain move forward national grid funding south west england what plan she have to provide funding for the national grid in the south west electricity network funding be regulate by ofgem through the network price control in the current price control national grid electricity transmission will be invest approximately million in the south west ofgem have allow billion for the distribution network company cover the south west billion of which be for the south west region specifically may declare an interest as one of my brilliant little sister work in the renewable energy sector want to see more renewable energy scheme get off the ground in the far south west but be be tell that scheme great than mw have to wait until at the early for grid connection this mean that dozen of renewable energy scheme be gather dust on paper when they should be generate clean power it be wrong and be set back our net zero ambition what be minister do to speed up grid connection for renewable energy scheme allow we to build the already approve clean energy scheme that we need which will create green job cut carbon and reduce soar energy bill as the minister for energy security and net zero my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart suggest from sedentary position we be do lot and lot specifically the government be use strategic planning to support investment ahead of the need in the network include the south west the first example of that be last year holistic network design which set out blueprint for connect new offshore wind project to the grid by an update to the holistic network design follow up exercise hnd will be publish early next year and provide recommendation for the connection of float offshore wind specifically in the celtic sea for the first time offshore wind developer participate in the crown estate leasing round will receive clarity over their grid connection from the electricity system operator at the same time as secure seabed lease call clive lewis the minister may be indeed question mr speaker area base home retrofit schemes what plan she have with cabinet colleague to help increase the capacity of local authority to deliver area base home retrofit scheme to support english local authority we fund an embed technical assistance facility provide access to expert training and guidance to enhance their capability to deliver our domestic grant scheme second time lucky the minister may be hear the following word leave my lip and know be agree with the former prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss in her claim that low and middle income household can not afford to pay for the transition to net zero where we differ be that do not believe that we should let the planet burn as she do instead the wealthy must pay for the green transition will the minister commit to income and wealth redistribution and finally give household and local authority the ability to transition successfully the government provide wide range of funding to support local authority in reach net zero through the core settlement grant funding scheme and uk growth funding the government be enable local authority to tackle net zero goal one of the big challenge that we have in deliver home retrofit scheme in cumbria be not with local authority but with industry capacity and skill what be the government do to try to send the right signal to industry so that we be get the right skill into the supply chain to deliver some of these scheme especially in area such as cumbria where we have skill desert my hon friend make really important point on skill in fact we have invest million in subsidised training over the past three year and have provide training opportunity we will continue to support this important industry boiler replacement guidance whether she plan to issue guidance to people with oil fire heating on replacement of boiler the government have create an online advice service to help consumer in replace fossil fuel heating system include oil boiler with heat pump we be also provide funding through the boiler upgrade scheme this will be helpful absolutely mr speaker there be panic now in germany as its premature ban on gas fire boiler approach the minister will want to avoid similar panic as we approach our own premature ban on oil fire boiler will he as ever thank my right hon friend we be listen as the prime minister set out we will reduce our emission in line with our obligation but do so in way that recognise the challenge that family face off grid household will be support through the transition and we will respond to the consultation in due course during the summer recess when be tour village find in my corner of devon that some constituent be worried about whether they should replace their oil fire boiler in the next couple of year with heat pump or put their faith in hydro treat vegetable oil some have be encourage by the pilot of so call hvo as an alternative source to heating oil what assurance can the minister offer that it will be truly sustainable source of fuel and not make from palm oil which encourage deforestation or should we put of our effort into heat pump as the hon member doubtless know we have conduct consultation on the use of hvo in heating and we be determined to ensure that we decarbonise heat in home include off grid home in way that be practical and align with minimise any negative impact on those family energy intensive industries decarbonisation what step her department be take to help energy intensive industry decarbonise the government have commit billion to support the early development of carbon capture and storage and million for the industrial energy transformation fund to help industry decarbonise phase of which be expect to open for application in early may put on the record the thank of back benchers to the clerk of the house for his work steel account for of global carbon dioxide emission and job here in the uk we have no viable alternative to steel which be why the government decision to go with an electric arc furnace only model for decarbonisation do not make any sense not only do it put at risk thousand of job but it make the industry vulnerable to change in steel price as the uk will have to import it the minister speak about carbon capture but can she explain why the government have not go for combination of technology such as carbon capture or the retrofitting require for hydrogen base steel production that way we would not only decarbonise the industry but protect those vital job and the industry in the uk for generation to come as the business and trade secretary set out the government deal have provide long term security for at least steel job the investment will grow uk domestic green steel production gently urge the hon lady to look at her party plan for industry which have be describe as impossible and decimate the working class energy intensive industry come in many form can my right hon friend provide any reassurance that the government will review the classification of what constitute an energy intensive industry sb joinery in my constituency contain large sawmill and planing facility but have be deem ineligible for high level of the energy bill discount scheme would my right hon friend be prepared to look at that case personally would be delighted to meet my right hon friend and discuss that particular case we keep look at everything we can do to support business as we have do this entire time call the shadow minister for year people have be call on the government to have proper plan to help our steel industry decarbonise instead the industry have lurch from crisis to crisis and now the government be spend million in deal that will make thousand of port talbot steelworker redundant be it not the simple truth that job and wealth will be lose because there be no comprehensive plan for steel automotive or any industry that need to decarbonise refer the hon lady to my previous comment the investment will provide long term security for at least steel job we have have record investment of billion in the auto industry this year again urge she to look at her own party plan its industry decarbonisation plan be disastrous and will push job and investment out of this country heat networks if she will take step to ensure that consumer do not pay for heat network remediation what step she be take to support heat network customer with energy bill what assessment she have make with cabinet colleague of the potential merit of introduce mandatory price cap on heat network the government be provide million in support for remedial work through the heat network efficiency scheme we be support customer with their bill via the energy bill discount scheme through the energy bill we will appoint ofgem as heat network regulator so that customer benefit from fair price must declare that live in block with heat network many heat network will be quite expensive to change under the technical rule propose by the government for give many block have also have cladding and other pressure on leaseholder be the government look carefully to ensure that customer be not be overlayere with many more charge to remediate network through the heat network efficiency scheme the government be provide million to upgrade exist heat network and reduce energy cost the scheme will upgrade old equipment and help consumer in more than house to reduce their energy use we will shortly announce the first award from the fund resident live in new mill quarter in hackbridge in my constituency have be plague by litany of problem since they be connect to the sutton decentralise energy network include an inability to change tariff do my hon friend agree that resident have be let down by the mismanagement identify in an independent report on its poor run by lib dem run sutton council will she commit to work with to ensure that heat network customer who have nowhere else to go for their energy be protect by new measure in the energy bill know how hard my hon friend work for his constituent and thank he for bring this scheme to my attention we want all heat network customer to receive high quality service and fair pricing which be why we be appoint ofgem as regulator through the energy bill and currently consult on how it will operate of course will meet my hon friend many of my resident be lock into district heat network scheme they have be pay up to time more than the rest of the uk because they be not protect by the energy price cap do the government not think it be time to implement mandatory price cap straight away at this moment in time we do not think that uniform price cap would benefit consumer give the huge diversity in size and scale of provider in the market however through the energy bill the secretary of state will have power to introduce price cap should one be beneficial in future family in fuel poverty what estimate her department have make of the number of family in fuel poverty in there be an estimate million household in fuel poverty the additional support we provide last year prevent household from fall into fuel poverty in the establish target support remain in place while from july household energy bill have be fall over family in bradford have be plunge into uncertainty as the tory government lurch from crisis to crisis more than one in five of my constituent now live in fuel poverty yet the minister still come here today with no real plan or solution and no real windfall tax on the booming profit of energy giant let ask the minister to put herself in the shoe of my constituent what do she have to say to those who frankly have be abandon and have to choose between warm home full stomach and school uniform for their child have experienced fuel poverty myself when be grow up do understand completely how the hon gentleman constituent feel that be why the government be absolutely committed to ensure that we support people we have give unprecedented support we have the warm home discount and the cost of live payment among many other measure to help constituent through the cost of living renewable energy sector high skilled job what step she be take to help promote the creation of high skilled job in the renewable energy sector this be crucial area there be already over job in the renewable energy sector and that will rise steeply over time we be invest billion in skill include green skill and include training opportunity in energy efficiency and low carbon heating may urge the government to give real priority to the creation of apprenticeship in the renewable energy and green sector that way we can use net zero to create great opportunity for young people and boost social mobility as former education minister be absolutely passionate about this area we have deliver almost million apprenticeship since the minister for energy security and net zero my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart chair the green job delivery group which will publish net zero and nature workforce action plan in the first of half of welcome the secretary of state to her position although the uk have the second large offshore wind capacity in the world after china denmark have three time as many job in the sector many british wind turbine be be build in spain holland and indonesia why be the government so far behind the curve on the green job bonanza that be so possible for our country thank to government policy and spending we will support another job in the green sector by as say we be lead the way in decarbonise fast than any other country with the job that come with that right across the country too welcome the secretary of state to her place and remind she that we start in this place at the same time four year ago will she highlight the job opportunity in the new renewable energy sector that ai present for my constituent in bolton my hon friend raise an interesting point about the job opportunity present by ai which will undoubtedly have an effect across the country and beneficial effect in this sector would be delighted to meet he to speak about this far but we will be set out more detail on our green job delivery group and our net zero and nature workforce action plan in the first half of would it not boost skill in renewable energy generation and installation as well as encourage more uptake if all those instal solar energy scheme have to be certify under the microgeneration certification scheme so that the householder farm or business concern would be guarantee payment for surplus energy feed into the grid the right hon gentleman ask an interesting question we have explore his suggestion of legislate to make certification mandatory we have no such plan at this time as there be mature approach to certification standard and most uk domestic solar installation already take place within well establish scheme domestic nuclear energy what assessment she have make of the potential contribution of great british nuclear to domestic nuclear energy target the british energy security strategy set out our ambition for deploy up to gw of civil nuclear by we launch great british nuclear to help deliver new nuclear project start with small modular reactor competition the gbn offer to successful vendor will include fund to support technology development and support with access site may say croeso and welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her place wylfa be recognise as the good site for new nuclear in the uk if not in europe but welsh affairs committee report state recently that ownership of the site be hold back progress what be the minister and great british nuclear do to transfer its ownership from hitachi to an active nuclear developer the term doughty champion and passionate be regularly throw about in this place but when it be case of championing wylfa new nuclear no one come close to my hon friend when launch the small modular reactor competition in july the secretary of state indicate that as part of comprehensive offer to industry gbn would support access to site for successful vendor and wylfa be one of number of site that could host civil nuclear project however no siting decision have be make so far topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility since my appointment fortnight ago the energy bill which will deliver cheap clean more secure energy be give third reading in this house we have fund record renewable energy project and have visit our pioneer culham centre for fusion energy have also launch the billion great british insulation scheme we have bolster our energy collaboration with ireland and japan we have make our big ever climate finance pledge and just yesterday we invite partner to invest in sizewell major component of our nuclear revival welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her new role she will be aware that the huge increase in offshore wind farm in the east of england have lead to an unwelcome proposal from national grid to put mile of pylon across the area we do not want that we need an offshore solution will my right hon friend meet member from the east of england to discuss this proposal thank my right hon friend for raise this issue today understand that concern have be raise by local community about the national grid electricity transmission plan for network reinforcement between norwich and tilbury the minister for nuclear and networks my hon friend the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie have visit the area and will continue to engage with colleague but be also happy to meet local mp to discuss the matter far call the shadow minister accord to analysis by the resolution foundation more than third of british household face high bill from the end of this month because of high standing charge and the demise of the energy bill support scheme and the people who use the least energy and those in the poor household be disproportionately bad off at the same time the windfall tax have massive loophole cost billion would not close those loophole and extend more help to people during the cost of living crisis be the right thing to do the hon gentleman will be aware that the government be raise energy profit levy and he will also be aware that stand charge be matter for ofgem let reiterate however that we be mindful of the cost of live crisis and have be provide support with the warm home discount the cost of live payment and raft of other measure to support people through this crisis the launch last week of the great british insulation scheme be very welcome so as to build on this and to kickstart mass retrofitting revolution will my hon friend liaise with the treasury to obtain its support for the introduction of such fiscal measure as an energy save stamp duty and an employee benefit scheme similar to the cycle to work scheme the government set the aspiration in the clean growth strategy of upgrade as many home as possible to energy performance certificate band by where practical cost effective and affordable we remain committed to that aspiration although tax policy sit with the treasury we be consider how to improve energy efficiency for owner occupy home and plan to consult by the end of energy company have accumulate hundred of pound if not over in consumer credit when those company go into administration the company take over do not honour that credit and people often with very little mean have lose hundred or thousand of pound how will the minister ensure that they get compensation and get credit by the new company with the amount of money they have lose can assure the hon lady that we be in constant conversation with ofgem on such matter although this be matter for ofgem have regular meeting to make sure that we be on top of this energy from waste require burn waste and it be therefore not conducive to net zero the expansion of the beddington incinerator in my constituency be not need to meet local demand so can my right hon friend assure that the environment agency will take that into account before make decision on whether or not to license the environment agency recent consultation on vary the environmental permit for the beddington energy recovery plant close on september the environment agency will carefully consider all relevant response and issue final decision in due course in the select committee inquiry into preparation for this winter one of the repeat call that we have hear from expert witness be to support the vulnerable and fuel poor with social tariff will the minister do that of course we be aware of the challenge that be face consumer this come winter which be why we be keep the price cap as safety net to give the hon gentleman reassurance we will be monitor the situation in case we need to look at this far recent investment in electric vehicle charging and the ev supply chain show the benefit of the government set clear target so that the private sector have the confidence to invest do my right hon friend agree that if we have similar policy consistency across the whole of the economy we would see great investment in green growth and in meet decarbonisation by the zero emission vehicle mandate support our commitment to end the sale of new petrol and diesel car and van by set it many year in advance and give clear notice to the market it provide appropriate stimulus to industry in way that the ultra low emission zone singularly fail to do as my hon friend will have note the energy minister get his fact wrong in his early response to the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas so he might want to correct the record the liberal democrat amendment to the energy bill to tackle flaring venting and leak of methane be select for separate vote it would have reduce methane emission by why do his government vote it down stand correct on that issue we have infrastructure some of which date from the and we be move at the maximum possible speed it be technologically and economically challenging to make this change and yet as set out early we be already show significant effort and of course we be champion of the methane pledge which we plan to exceed when be at will be urge other country to follow we in agree and support that world bank methane pledge the hydrogen industry will be sure welcome the introduction of the hydrogen production business model for green hydrogen with further business model plan for next year but the storage and transportation business model for hydrogen be not due to be finalise until for customer of company such as luxfer gas cylinders of colwick in my gedle constituency this be potential barrier to some project move forward can my right hon friend give come clarity on the sequencing and whether there be scope to bring forward the storage and transportation business model so that the timing be join up my hon friend be right to talk about the challenge of bring all the piece together to unlock opportunity the government will promote the whole hydrogen economy production demand network and storage and stimulate private sector investment in august the government publish the low carbon hydrogen agreement set out the hydrogen production business model term we will award contract for that in quarter of my colleague and be happy to meet my hon friend to talk about make sure we get this absolutely right so that we maximise its benefit biodiesel producer in my constituency be be undercut by cheap chinese import because of the government decision to award they inward processing relief this be make it difficult for we to support uk industry so can we have an explanation for why that decision be make will write to the hon gentleman write for the daily telegraph last year our now prime minister say on my watch we will not lose swathe of our good farmland to solar farm yet the industry have not hear that and vast swathe of farmland in my constituency total square mile be open to planning engulf whole village and use the good and most versatile land will my right hon friend meet to discuss how he and the department can ensure that the prime minister keep his very important promise can assure my hon friend that plan policy and the associated guidance encourage large scale solar project to be locate on previously develop or low value land where greenfield site or high grade land be use developer be require to justify use such land and to design their project to avoid mitigate and where necessary compensate for any impact hear my hon friend personal testimony and will be happy to meet she to discuss this far almost of the housing stock in my constituency date from before and be therefore classify as historical what plan do the department have to improve skill level in retrofit historical residential building as previously mention retrofit be one of our most important project of course skill be real issue which be why we be delighted that this will enable we to enhance our skill basis welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her new role give the vital role that oil and gas play in manage our energy security as demand continue albeit decline and the vital job skill technology and expertise in that industry of which be think to be immediately transferrable to the renewable sector do my right hon friend share my disappointment at today report of humza yousaf vow to end scotland place as the oil and gas capital of europe my hon friend be right last year we be dependent on fossil fuel for of our energy if we import more gas from abroad it will be in the form of liquefy natural gas which accord to report from the north sea transition authority two week ago have four time the production emission of domestic gas the scottish national party ably support by the labour party want to threaten job billion of tax revenue over the next five year and the very subsea engineering and technological capability not to mention the balance sheet that we need to develop hydrogen carbon capture usage and storage and the rest of the transition it be madness and it be the policy of the snp yes we need increase electric arc capacity to reprocess more scrap steel in the uk but trostre tinplate packaging work in my constituency need grade of steel that can be produce only by the blast furnace process until green production technology be develop with such project elsewhere in europe will the secretary of state commit to invest in develop these technology at port talbot thus reduce emission and keep job in port talbot and llanelli share the hon lady enthusiasm for keep those job which be why we be invest hundred of million of pound to ensure that these industry can make that transition entirely agree with she on the importance of innovation and make sure it be embed so that not only do we sustain those industry but so that through innovation we can strengthen they in the year ahead decade ago the onshore wind industry commit to community benefit protocol to provide compensation of per mw instal per annum to community for the duration of wind scheme so far solar developer have refuse to do something similar and surely that be not fair do my right hon friend agree that compensation scheme must be equal whether wind or solar be involve it be perhaps typical of my hon friend that not only be she ask question and champion this issue but she have schedule meeting with immediately afterwards look forward to discuss this with she and make sure that we have the most coherent position possible as to where we be set on rewarding community that host transmission infrastructure and other part of our transition look forward to have that conversation with she in the come minute my constituent lee haywood be on communal heat network and he and his neighbour see their price per kwh double last winter what protection can the minister give as we come into the next winter as resident in dalmarnock be really worried that price will again soar in this unregulated area we have put in place protection to ensure that price be not go to go up we have the energy price guarantee in addition let point out that price be come down do the government think the uk be on track to meet the net zero target do the government think the uk will meet that target do the government even really care we have of course meet all our carbon budget to date in the progress report the climate change committee say it have increase confidence in our meeting carbon budget and yes this country will meet its net zero target by it will do so in line with the advice that we be give and be proud of the fact the hon gentleman could share this with his constituent who may be concern otherwise that this country have cut its emission by more than any other major economy on earth thank to the policy of this government this morning receive text from one of the leadership team at one of our local hospice it say that there have be no additional support for our energy cost cost have go up while statutory support have change hospices uk lobby for additional support to no avail we operate and have to keep the heating on you know what the weather be like in cumbria in the winter when will the minister come up with bespoke support scheme for our vital hospice thank the hon gentleman for the meeting we have have and be mindful of the situation that hospice face we have give support and will make sure that keep monitor the situation on point of order mr speaker in the exchange about the amendment on flare just now do not think hear the minister formally withdraw his accusation that get my fact wrong and certainly do not hear he apologise give that he have now accept that he get his fact wrong and my fact be right would love he to formally correct the record and perhaps even to apologise as well rise the minister be desperate to do so far to that point of order mr speaker the hon lady be quite right to raise this in that way and be happy both to withdraw that and to apologise to she for get my fact wrong on that occasion school building closures urgent question to ask the secretary of state for education if she will make statement on the number of school affect by reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and the impact of build closure on child learning as say in my statement to the house on september this government be support affect school and college to minimise disruption to education thank headteacher staff local authority and trust who continue to provide face to face education to their pupil two week ago we publish list of education setting with building affect by raac before provide an update want to reiterate that our view be that parent and child should find out from their school not from list on government website or from the medium our approach have always prioritise that give school and college the space to focus on what be important minimise disruption to education none the less we recognise the public interest on september we publish list of education setting know to be affect by raac thank to the hard work of school and college leader all of those setting be now offer face to face education with setting offer full time face to face education to all pupil we have today publish an update list include further setting with confirm raac of the confirm case setting be provide full time face to face education to all pupil as have say before we will do everything in our power to support school and college in respond to raac in their building every school or college with confirm raac be assign dedicated support from our team of caseworker bespoke plan be put in place to ensure they receive the support that suit their circumstance project delivery team be on site to provide support whether that be order or find alternative accommodation option or put in place structural solution we will fund these mitigation include instal alternative classroom space where school and college make reasonable request for additional help with revenue cost such as transport to location those will be approve we will also fund long term refurbishment or rebuilding project to permanently remove raac through capital grant or rebuilding project through the school rebuilding programme want to reassure pupil parent and staff that this government will do whatever it take to support our school and college to keep everybody safe to respond to raac and to minimise disruption to education thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker before go any far let emphasise that the safety of child should rightly be the priority of every member of this house however the question today be not simply about whether that should be our priority but about the colossal shamble of secretary of state who as we learn from the education committee this morning do not merely sit on new advice about the safety of school building which she receive on august but do nothing for four day and then she act decisively she go on holiday for the good part of week some day pass from the day she receive the crucial advice to the day the headteacher be tell to close their school cause chaos for parent just fortnight ago the secretary of state response to question about the management of the department own building be simple and proud the motto she have make she own nothing to do with she have do good job while other have be sit on their backside do the secretary of state still think that be good enough more simply even under this prime minister weak as he be and this government how on earth do she think she could get away with go on holiday rather than take any form of action at all will she at last take responsibility for year of failure three week of chaos and the year stretch ahead of the child who be sit under steel girder when will all our child be back in their own school and classroom parent family staff and above all our child deserve answer and they deserve well from this government and well than this secretary of state thank the hon lady for her question as soon as we have information we take decision in every case when we first see the incident in we take decision and we put out new guidance and warning we put out new guidance in we start survey directly in when the previous secretary of state start to get more concerned about raac in our school estate we then send in surveyor directly because the responsible body be not move quickly enough let turn now to the initial advice three new case emerge over the summer and some be subject to advice as the hon lady say which come on august instruct those involve to get more technical information the last case be really what tip we into make decision it be very difficult decision be not sure the hon lady would have make it because labour do not tend to make these difficult decision and the labour government in wales have still not do so because of the impact on child and because of the impact on our school leader and teacher the last case which be in another school setting in england take place on august we go to investigate that to see what have happen on my own decision go abroad because that be the first time that could go abroad go abroad for my father birthday know that would still be chair the meeting which do on saturday sunday and monday and then make the decision as we have now make decision to come back from holiday immediately my return be delay by one day because of the air traffic control incident so get back to announce the decision on thursday when look at the new case say that we need to get technical evidence the second thing say be that we need to operationalise this know that this would be difficult do not want to put school in position where if put out notice via the medium or directly they would be leave with the problem want to stand up caseworker want to stand up portacabin want to speak to utility company to make sure that everything would be in place so that we could minimise the length of time that it take to put up those portacabin want to put more structural engineering company in place because know that we would do more survey also want to make sure that we have nationwide prop company so that we could put the largely horizontal structural solution in place to fix everything when we have to make major decision there be no point create more issue than we need to we need to operationalise that decision which be what decide to do the time from the last case to the announcement be one week that be probably one of the quick decision that most people have make in this house and we operationalise it all while be still work as always do call the chair of the education committee be grateful to the minister with responsibility for the school system and the permanent secretary for spend two hour this morning with the education committee on this issue they be able to provide number of useful answer include on the provision of temporary classroom have to say that be very disappointed last night to receive what be non answer on that question about temporary classroom which have already be ask at the public accounts committee be glad that baroness barran be able to go far with the select committee today the information that she provide we with be that there be seven case from before the summer require temporary building the department be now aware of school that will require some form of temporary accommodation eleven have that temporary accommodation in place as of friday there be the potential for as many as single classroom and double classroom to be need as temporary accommodation urge the secretary of state to ensure that those be provide as swiftly as possible and that school and responsible body have certainty about when those will be in place so that we absolutely do what she say to minimise disruption of child education key concern of the select committee be child not in school and anything that can be do to minimise that disruption to create great certainty for the teacher and the leader who have do such an amazing job of respond to this will certainly be welcome thank my hon friend the chair of the education committee apologise about the write answer the previous night we have more recent information at the education committee the case be always be assess and the number be always be update which be why we choose date to publish the late information the number be move very quickly he be absolutely right raac school already have temporary building that be instal or in use there be further site think that have make inquiry and request potential order as he rightly say there be single classroom double classroom plus mixture of toilet provision on the portacabin would just like to say that have be to number of these school and meet the child at the first school visit the child be all petition to stay in the portacabin because they actually prefer they to the classroom the portacabin be very high that be true advise the shadow secretary of state to visit some of they herself perhaps the secretary of state could clarify whether it be or school that still need temporary classroom because we have hear different figure from she and from her ministerial colleague at the education committee early something headteacher have say to be that they do not just need the temporary classroom but they need some of they kitte out as science lab or design and technology classroom for example there be cost to do that it be not just question of chair and table it be much more what be her department do to make sure that child have the right classroom so they can do their assessment which be already tick along towards next year exam confirm that the project director and caseworker have make inquiry request potential order for further site there be some specialist requirement for science lab or other specialist equipment and there be number of thing take place on that school be share science lab equipment in the short term either with another school or with another part of the school we be also look at mitigation in the school go to see where the child be very happy in their portacabin they have horizontally prop and mitigate the science lab first so they be able to use the science lab in combination with the portacabin there be also specialist portacabin available which be be look at in specific circumstance thank the secretary of state and the minister for schools for all their hard work but ask the secretary of state to do something from the dispatch box haygrove school in my constituency be disaster of construction it be caledonian modular construction and it have go badly wrong will she please reiterate from that dispatch box that this be nothing to do with concrete but be rather about bad construction child and parent be still worried that there be concrete in the school and there be not could she please reconfirm that confirm that haygrove school be not subject to raac it be caledonian modular build and we be look at the quality of small number of those school we be work right now on what solution we can put in place there be another such school in the constituency of my right hon friend the minister for skills apprenticeships and higher education and we be put temporary school structure in place for those school the crumble concrete crisis have be year in the making exacerbate by the catastrophic failure of the prime minister when he be chancellor to sign off on the school rebuilding programme that department for education official request yet the current chancellor as we have hear today will not give the department any new money to fix the roof so what do the secretary of state say to the hundred of school currently manage asbestos leaky roof and cold classroom which will be put to the back of the queue for rebuild yet again because the treasury still do not understand the importance of invest in our child and education as someone who have be the secretary of state since october and have secure record funding for our school go up to billion year next year which be high than it have ever be by any measure hon member wish to use feel that the chancellor and the prime minister very much invest in our school there have be lot of nonsense talk about building schools for the future opposition member consistently claim that that would have fix the issue know they be not normally across the detail so think they might be interested in few fact park view school in tottenham which be recently visit by the leader of the opposition hornsey school for girls in hornsey and stepney all saints school in stepney green be all refurbish or rebuild under bsf but all three be still suffer from raac the opposition do not even know how to solve the problem when it be right in front of their nose my right hon friend have be absolutely right to act decisively to put the safety of child first as the list of affected school have grow today what reassurance can she give we on the number of school still await expedite survey and the absolute cut off point by which those survey will be complete last time be at this dispatch box of all questionnaire have be respond to now it be so the publicity have really help to drive people who have not already respond and we be grateful to they also commit that all the school that be wait to be survey would be survey by the end of this week and can confirm that that will absolutely be do we have good rate of survey we have eight company do they and we now have process that mean that as soon school come in we will get to they very quickly to survey have straightforward question for the secretary of state that hope she will answer clearly will she guarantee that the cost of all the repair will be fund by new money from the government not the current education budget which be not enough anyway as think have explain before there be different part to the funding initially the surveying work the mitigation work and the temporary accommodation will all be fund by the dfe capital budget we have budget for that work there be also revenue budget for additional thing such as transport hire village hall and so on that will also come from building fund within the dfe we have already announce some of the school rebuilding project but we have space leave and some be still to be announce so some of that will be utilise beyond that as the chancellor say we will do everything need to keep child safe in our school put on record my admiration for mrs sudworth tania lewyckyj and canon slade school for their monumental effort to ensure the smooth running of the school since the raac announcement will my right hon friend outline how the department can encourage surveyor who have concern about building contain asbestos to help avoid delay in the installation of temporary classroom join my hon friend in praise the team at canon slade school who have all pupil in face to face education the vast majority of school identify as have raac have all pupil in face to face learning and that be down to the dedication of our school leader all school have an asbestos plan but if there be asbestos that need to be move as part of the mitigation work it will be safely remove how many publicity video for party political purpose do the secretary of state make for conservative mp on the day that she find out about the raac issue do not recall make any particularly party political broadcast on the day when we make the announcement do the evening round and the pooled clip and recording and the minister for schools my right hon friend the member for bognor regis and littlehampton nick gibb then do the morning round that be the focus of our attention in term of publicity the national audit office report of june be of course agree with the department as all nao report be give that that report identify that up to child be in school where there be critical safety issue what be the technical evidence that the secretary of state say she require some two month later when that final school collapse in the way it do thank the hon gentleman for that very good question the nao report address bid to and demand for the school rebuilding programme on the technical information what we have do during the if he care to listen there be an important distinction the survey that we start conduct from september when we send our own surveyor into school look at raac and whether it be critical or non critical that be why school have already be close immediately they be see as critical what change be that there be three instance where the ceiling have be assess as non critical but have fail want structural engineer be not structural engineer to go in and tell whether something assess as non critical have fail for another reason could they say why it have fail or do need to look at every non critical roof and change my understanding of how we want to treat they want to be cautious that be what we do and as result we decide to act on all the non critical ceiling straight away to keep people safe half an hour ago come from meeting with london fire chief who be call for national register of building contain raac that be practical ask will the secretary of state work with other departments to ensure that it become reality think the fire chief usually work with local responsible body to find out how they can minimise fire risk within local area if may mr speaker will put four question to the secretary of state because the pupil parent and staff of st leonard catholic school deserve answer first can we confirm that the plan rebuild of st leonard will now be accelerate secondly when will the venue for rehome st leonard be confirm and the finance approve thirdly what additional financial and practical provision will be in place for the most vulnerable pupil particularly those with special educational need and disability and those receive free school meal fourthly what option for special consideration will exam board apply to year and year student this year be delighted that st leonard now have mix of face to face and remote learning it have do fantastic job to enable that work with local partner on school rebuilding we be make those decision with the project director we have on site at st leonard we will consider first the short term and medium term mitigation and then when we should do the rebuilding we have an mps surgery later for anybody in the house to raise specific case that they be interested in shall be there with my ministers and official and we be happy to go into detail on any case and give member the late it be still an evolve situation but we will be there and will support st leonard as much as possible to ensure that child be safely educate there be sure that all the people the secretary of state tell to get off their backside will be very sympathetic to the fact that she need to go on holiday while this crisis be in progress on revenue and cost the secretary of state have itemise number of thing that the government will cover but school face vast range of potential revenue cost include surveyor and other cost be she say that all cost relate to raac will be cover yes all the cost that the hon gentleman mention be reasonable cost also be sure that he be delighted that all the pupil at st thomas more catholic comprehensive school be in face to face education on the hon gentleman point about my working be always happy to work no matter where be and always have be throughout my very long career ellesmere port catholic high school have huge challenge five classroom the chapel two corridor change facility kitchen and canteen have be close mean that number of technical lesson can not be teach and no hot food can be serve have direct plea from the headteacher who say can not understate the urgency of this situation particularly with the temporary accommodation we be have real issue get the department to approve mitigation so that we can operate for all our student in the short term after this statement will the secretary of state have look at this case and talk to official about get the approval that that headteacher need absolutely thank the hon gentleman for raise that case will take note of ellesmere port catholic high school if he would like to join the mps surgery later we can go through that matter in great detail or can write to he about it if his diary do not allow that may press the secretary of state on the source of the fund need to rebuild the raac school ask because repair to raac hospital be come from delay indefinitely other hospital rebuilding scheme include two in my constituency will any future school capital project be similarly reschedule no colyton grammar school in my corner of devon be one of the school add today to the list of school already know to have raac on site the national association of head teachers have point out that prop up ceiling with metal pole be clearly not serious option want colyton grammar school to be able to open up the small part of its estate that have have to close but if there be new money and work will not impact on the exist school rebuilding programme what impact can we expect they to have on funding pledge last year to school such as tipton st john primary school and tiverton high school can assure the hon gentleman that we be do very professional job there be no intention of prop school up with metal pole they will largely be horizontal prop involve temper beam which be how building be build in the first the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson show her absolute ignorance of this they will be either steel structure or wooden structure that will then have another roof underneath urge everybody to go and look at these classroom because they will see that there be no vertical propping not in any of the school that have see so far and that be certainly not long term solution the hon gentleman will be satisfied that these be very high quality solution for our child while the dust have settle on medium coverage at this time thank the secretary of state for her clear commitment and positivity today in find way forward we understand that there might be some online learning as experience during covid but that can lead to detrimental effect on learn give the importance of face to face engagement what discussion have the secretary of state have with the department in northern ireland to gauge the depth of the concrete problem there be school in my constituency but understand that it have be able to sort out the problem and teaching in school have continue it be important to know whether any extra funding be available however and if so would that be subject to the barnett consequential so we can also get some benefit immediately when we have more information we share it with the devolved nation we have be conduct survey for over year at that point but it be clear that that be not happen in the devolved nation so they be still not able to identify where the raac be and go on to take the action that we take very decisively at the end of last month we will continue to work with they and support they and to share evidence include on how to mitigate in way that make good solution for our child west coast main line franchise pm urgent question to ask the secretary of state for transport if he will make statement on the contractual and operational situation of the west coast main line franchise and congratulate the minister on his promotion be grateful to the hon gentleman for his congratulation the minister of state the hon member for bexhill and battle huw merriman continue to represent his majesty government today in poland to support uk train company among other at major international trade fair and be therefore reply on his behalf the department have award new national rail contract to first trenitalia to continue to operate the west coast partnership provide west coast train service as avanti west coast the national rail contract will have core term of three year and maximum possible term of nine year after three year the department can terminate the contract at any point with three month notice in october and march the department approve the award of short term contract to first trenitalia operate as awc to continue to operate service on the west coast main line award short term contract allow the department to monitor progress by awc in improve performance follow the withdrawal of rest day work before consider whether it would be appropriate to award long term contract avanti performance have improve significantly during this time and take into account other relevant consideration the secretary of state have decide to award long term contract as announce in today write statement over recent month avanti have make significant progress in recover from the poor reliability and punctuality deliver in the latter half of last year in line with its recovery plan and since the introduction of its recovery timetable in december performance have steadily improve with cancellation attribute to awc fall from in early january to as low as in july over of train now arrive within minute of their schedule time an improvement from in december another day another blow for passenger who use the west coast main line fresh from the negative cross party reaction yesterday to news that high speed phase be on the chop block we have the department for transport on the last day before recess shock horror sneak out the extraordinary award of up to nine year for avanti west coast and up to eight year for crosscountry despite improvement in avanti service it be still not run full timetable and the minister can not ask we and passenger up and down the west coast main line to simply forget the last few year of horrendous performance the avanti service be on the brink run into the ground by mismanagement and poor labour relation in his letter to mps the secretary of state say that avanti be the most improved operator where performance be compare to the previous year well that would not be particularly hard talk about set yourself low bar this award will be see by most people as rewarding failure my criticism of avanti be in no way reflective of the staff who have be first class when have use the service be not overwhelm with confidence however when it take several attempt at last week select committee to get mr mellors to tell just how many job he propose to cut by close the glasgow ticket office give the variable standard deliver by avanti we need full transparency so can the minister tell the exact criterion avanti will have to consistently meet if the extension at the end of the core contract be to be grant what engagement have the department for transport have with trade union and the scottish government in make this decision what alternative do the department consider be the operator of last resort consider do the minister not understand that this award will be see as tory private good dogma we have pile of evidence through the operator of last resort and scotrail that publicly own and operate railway work moreover with its stake in avanti first trenitalia might well be able to reinvest in italian rail infrastructure be it not time to follow scotland lead and put our railway back into the public sector where it belong thank the hon gentleman for his flurry of question and shall address what he say he ask for the release of the criterion of the contract award that be commercial matter and we be not go to discuss that but can reassure the hon gentleman that the minister of state my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle have meet very regularly with the entire industry and have be work on weekly basis with official and with avanti and therefore have have the matter very much in hand on the performance the hon gentleman describe be astounded that he be not agree with the secretary of state and celebrate the improvement over the last nine month and six month in particular cancellation be as low as in july of train arrive within minute over additional driver have be train and bring on since april each of those be significant achievement it be all very well for the hon gentleman to talk about engagement but the hon gentleman have not exactly be shy in write to the department so ask my official to scan the letter we have receive and do not think there be single one from he in the last year mention avanti if that be an indication of how content he be with the service be delighted to hear it call the select committee chair as regular user of avanti service agree that the performance have improve markedly and pay tribute to the new manage director andy mellors and his team for turn around what be an abysmal service appreciate that the minister will not be able to talk in detail about the contract but will he say bit about the extent to which this new contract move away from the micromanage national rail contract that have be in place since covid they be right at the time but be now stifle innovation in the sector and hope that this be just the first of the revision of these national rail contract be grateful to my hon friend for his question he bring not just personal experience of this service as an mp for milton keynes but also his considerable expertise as chairman of the transport committee he be right to pick up on the point of micromanagement and that be one reason why have be in period of relatively short contract number of two month and three month contract in order to monitor progress the government have now see fit to move to much long framework three year contract but with the potential capacity to terminate thereafter if performance be not sustain that strike the right balance between give the certainty avanti need to continue to invest in improve the service and the accountability that the government rightly demand would add that there be some awareness that in relation to service to milton keynes west midland and north wales there be progress to be make and think be right in say that the new chief executive be very much focused on that issue as well call the shadow minister for the second time in two day the government have be drag to the house to explain the state of our crumble rail network and for the second time in two day the rail minister have fail to turn up surely thing can not get any bad for passenger in the north we think but today the minister have prove we all wrong by confirm that passenger could have to suffer up to nine more year of avanti west coast and up to eight more year of crosscountry the minister claim that there have be enough improvement to justify up to decade more of the utter chaos that be consume our railway thank to those two fail operator yet the late statistic show that avanti be the second bad operator in the country for punctuality last month with only of its train run on time crosscountry be the fourth bad with only of its train on time what be the government response to that more lucrative contract and million of pound pay out in performance bonus these decision have leave glare question for the minister to answer what performance metric be consider when the government make these decision have performance payment be restructure in the new contract or will they continue to reward failure do the government consider the operator of last resort which have drive improvement on other line the country be tired of this cycle of failure with cancellation and delay and any prospect of reform kick into the long grass it be clear that this government be determined to run our rail network into the ground be their plan really to allow for rail service to have another decade of failure under the tories with hundred of million hand over to shareholder in performance bonus and fee if so it be clear that they be out of idea and out of time if they can not put passenger first be it not time for they to step aside and let we deliver the change our passenger so desperately need thank the hon member for that brave shot let just remind he that far from be drag to the house the government publish write ministerial statement and press release this morning not only that but to the extent that the government be drag to the house it be by the scottish national party this be the second time in two day that the labour party have be catch nap by another party in this house as to the availability of the rail minister we try to pay total football in the department for transport while cruyff be hare down one wing we expect neeskens to be play through the centre and that be how we think about these thing the hon gentleman be right to highlight the previous underperformance but he be entirely wrong to predict that that will continue because we see the evidence in front of we as have already say cancellation have be as low as in july and over of train be now arrive within minute of their schedule time that be part of the basis on which the secretary of state have decide to award this new contract if the alternative that the labour party be propose be the nationalisation of our railway look forward to see the budgetary implication of that let alone any justification that civil servant direct by labour ministers would do well job than this new professional team at avanti while appreciate the point that the rail replacement minister make about recent improvement in avanti do my right hon friend accept that the failure of avanti in recent year have lead to consumer vote with their foot and refuse to use avanti service where they can in the case of passenger travel from birmingham to london they have be come on to the chiltern line instead which be add to the overcrowding on that line what reassurance can he give that there be incentive in the new contract for avanti to win back that trust so that we be not maintain overcrowding on other railway such as chiltern with my hon friend minutiose attention to detail he will recognise that yesterday we have the rail replacement bus minister but today we have another rail replacement minister that be thoroughly in order as regard the effect on customer again my hon friend be spot on it be very noticeable how much the new team at avanti recognise the commercial challenge of woo back customer they have lose follow the disastrous underperformance of last year which they recognise understand and accept that be vital commercial challenge we judge that they be begin to meet that and do more than begin to meet that as matter of service there be much furth to go as regard the extension of the quality of the service they recognise that and that be all in the interest of customer and well customer experience it seem that this contract have be award on the basis that it be little less crap than it use to be be that really the way to make decision in government the office of rail and road statistic in august show that avanti be the second worst perform operator with only of train run on time that be not good enough speak as someone who be customer and speak on behalf of my constituent in the north it be appalling this be ideologically dogmatically drive it be nonsense the hon member use of choice parliamentary or possibly unparliamentary language be not something would want to repeat even if think it be accurate it be important for he to recognise the progress that have be make if he do not recognise that that be pity because there be very considerable improvement the question now for the house and for government be how to sustain and enhance that improvement in the long term the judgment have be make that long term contract will give the stability in which the company can invest for the betterment of traveller and that be to everyone advantage it pain to say it but have to tell my right hon friend that the decision his department have make today will be very badly receive in north wales north wales passenger have have to endure substandard service from avanti for far too long the prime example of that be this summer at the height of the holiday season which be so important to north wales when avanti decide to cut four service and provide virtually no through service from london to the region can my right hon friend assure the house that his department will be keep very close eye on avanti performance in north wales over the come month and year and that if necessary it will terminate the franchise that have be confirm today completely understand the concern that my right hon friend describe as he will be aware in many of these individual case problem lie at the network level or be result of driver shortage or other reason as well as underperformance by the company but absolutely recognise and avanti recognise the point he raise the answer be that of course the department will remain very firmly focused on continue to hold this company to account for the delivery of service and the continued improvement of those service once again we find that transport ministers can not even find friend on their own benches for these decision people in my constituency and in the north of england will be astonish at the decision to reimpose avanti because of its systematic failure the minister do not answer the question he be just ask will the government guarantee that they will cancel avanti contract if once again it be the poster boy for failure that be not the question be ask do answer the question that be ask it be build into the new contract structure that after the initial period which allow for the investment that be require to continue to make sustained improvement there be recur three month capacity to call in the contract as require precisely in order to exercise the kind of scrutiny and accountability that the hon gentleman be seek be regular user of the west coast main line and the improvement in both punctuality and reliability over recent month have be welcome the minister will be aware of the ongoing capacity issue at preston station that be compromise potential improvement across lancashire such as the creation of pass loop on the south fylde line which would double the number of train come into blackpool south every single hour can the minister raise that issue with departmental colleague so that we can hopefully break the logjam and create the condition for improvement in localise service in lancashire thank my hon friend for his positive remark which give the lie to the previous comment make directly can assure he that the government be focused and will remain available to discuss and consider that point can also reiterate and double down on point that make early one of the function of be able to provide long contract be to allow the introduction of more fleet and in particular brand new fleet of electric and bi mode hitachi train to replace the current diesel fleet we expect that there will be sustain improvement at the level of roll stock as well as at the level of service provision judge by their appearance in the chamber guess that the ministerial team be just like avanti delay or cancel yes the service have improve but from such low level and it be still woeful service do the minister truly believe that this be good outcome for passenger be not sure what the hon gentleman be refer to since the minister be on time will not say that it be an improved service over the normal one but it be hopefully an adequate replacement of course the government stand behind this decision process of care and attention have be give weekly to the performance of the company and separately to the contract grant it have be do with great attention to detail as the hon gentleman would expect holyhead be the second busy roll on roll off port in the uk and with anglesey new freeport status we be at the beginning of our economic renaissance as such it be vital that we have connectivity particularly now that the labour government in cardiff will not agree to third menai crossing how be minister go to ensure that avanti deliver reliable service with direct train from holyhead to euston for my ynys môn constituent many of whom share their frustration with the rail minister when he visit anglesey in the summer it speak very well of the rail minister that he do visit and engage with my hon friend and her constituent think that be absolutely right she ask how it will be do it will be do by provide contractual framework in which there can be more investment by bring on more driver by recognise that there be considerable scope for further improvement in the service to north wales in particular and by improvement in roll stock all of that will make for well service datum show that the number of train cancel across the rail network continue to rise and be at the high level since record begin in the minister keep refer to july figure know full well just how bad august be in fact statistic show that train in ukraine be run more reliably than our service here despite that country network clearly be under considerably great pressure these problem do not stop with avanti persistent issue on the west coast main line have knock on impact on any east west service cross that line when will the minister accept that the current system be simply not work the hon lady be absolutely right that there be knock on effect and that some of those effect bear on east west service that be one of the reason that the department have separately announce and negotiate national rail contract for crosscountry as rail operator in order to provide framework for stable further investment in those knock on service declare an interest as long suffer user of the avanti service on the west coast main line in avanti have the most customer complaint of any operator and it be consistently rat one of the worst perform operator on the rail network despite that ministers spend an eye water million of taxpayer money in bonus to company executive for customer experience and act as good operator can the minister explain when it become government policy to reward failure the hon lady be deliberately draw on statistic from before the recent improvement that the government be recognise in this contract award however there be further point it be of course right to raise individual item but we ought to get away from situation in which politician feel that they can micromanage and second guess decision make by people at the operating level the key thing be to make sure that the quality of management be in place to drive continue sustained improvement as we expect it now be with the new chief executive mr mellors as regular user recognise that the avanti service have improve in recent month although frankly it would have be hard for it to get much bad but give the sustained poor performance in the past and the august performance figure we have just hear about this contract award feel very premature would it not have be well to wait and ensure that we see prove sustained improvement from avanti before award such long contract of course variety of consideration sit around any contract award the attraction of this one be that it allow the most rapid possible progress on fleet improvement and support for the new management team that might be expect as the hon gentleman would imagine the secretary of state have spend considerable amount of time talk to the new management to make sure that they really be focus on improvement and to hear in detail what their plan for that improvement be the award be make in part on that basis this decision be as embarrassing as it be baffle the minister talk about improvement but my constituent have not see those improvement he talk about reduce the number of cancellation with avanti have cancel half of the service from chester directly to london that will obviously reduce the number of cancellation yesterday for example avanti start train from crewe rather than from chester that presumably do not count as cancellation but that be absolutely no consolation to someone in chester it seem to that the government know that the company be play with the figure and be prepared to accept second class service for the people of the north understand the hon gentleman concern it be fair to say that from day to day there be different issue that interrupt good service as have already say those relate not just to the availability of driver and other key staff but to underperformance from time to time and disruption to network rail infrastructure all of those thing can play their role in highly integrate network the right hon member for clwyd west mr jones and have work for many year on the issue surround rail connectivity cover chester and north wales and since arrive in this house in december have not see any improvement the minister talk about micromanage situation but the reality be that the government do not seem to have understand what happen to chester and north wales during the summer as the right hon member say the decision be take to cancel through train which fundamentally affect tourism and the visitor economy not just for chester but across north wales to be honest that smack of game the figure and my constituent and resident across north wales be absolutely stagger that this contract have be re award to avanti west coast simply do not understand that this be so business critical and important to local resident and there have be failure to take into account the reality of travel across cheshire and north wales the hon lady do not ask question but understand every word of her speech since she be new to the house she might want to have conversation directly with the rail minister about this he be highly engaged on these issue as colleague across the chamber will know if she have not see any improvement in relation to her constituency at least she have the satisfaction of know that improvement have be recognise around the house the government have ensure the immediate future of avanti west coast but the same can not be say for great british railways which have an office but no power we urgently need body to provide oversight and accountability to fix britain break railway the government be in favour of that so can the minister confirm that legislation to create great british railways will be announce in the king speech thank the hon lady for her tempting invitation but be not go to second guess his majesty on what he will announce in the king speech what can say be that this be topic of great interest to the government and as she will know the department be make considerable progress in the non legislative mode that we be in at the moment to achieve many of the goal we all share avanti manufacturing director andy mellors tell the transport committee that avanti would be cut staff at glasgow central station by more than third and close its ticket office why do company that deliver such poor and expensive service and that hold its customer in such contempt deserve to have its contract renew potentially for almost decade what recall from that hearing be that mr mellors say of the ticket at glasgow be sell through the ticket office that there would be full staff in front of the ticket office that those staff would work from the first train in the morning until the last train at the end of the day and that they would continue to accept cash that sound like quite good service offer to thank the minister for respond to the urgent question resettlement of afghans since june around people from afghanistan have be safely relocate to the united kingdom we owe they debt of gratitude and in return our offer have be generous the uk government have grant all afghans relocate through safe and legal route indefinite leave to remain include the immediate right to work alongside access to the benefit system and vital health education and employment support give the unprecedented speed and scale of the evacuation we warmly welcome our afghan friend into temporary hotel accommodation until settle accommodation could be find however bridge hotel be not and be never design to be permanent solution indeed in statement to this house in march make it clear that it be unjustifiable for around third of those relocate from afghanistan still to be live in costly bridging accommodation up to month after arrive to safety in the uk long term residency in hotel prevent some family from properly put down root and be cost uk taxpayer million day that be not sustainable that be why at the end of april we begin issue notice to quit to the individual who remain in bridge accommodation make it clear that access to costly hotel would end follow minimum three month notice period and encourage move into settle accommodation be pleased to confirm that as of august the government have successfully end the use of bridge hotel for legally resettle afghans we estimate that over of those who be in bridge accommodation at the end of march have be help into home or pre match into settle accommodation end the provision of bridge accommodation be the right thing to do for our afghan friend who can now get on with rebuild their life and represent fair deal for the british taxpayer indeed it be not right to continue to ask taxpayer to foot the bill for costly bridge hotel when as we have demonstrate settle accommodation could be find for the overwhelming majority of guest that require considerable national effort and represent significant national achievement and extend my thank to colleague across central government as well as to local authority and third sector partner who have all play part without dedicated caseworking team and council in addition to the million funding package announce in march this mammoth task would not have be possible not only be we on track to deliver home for afghans through the local authority housing fund which will help build sustainable stock of affordable accommodation for the future but we have mobilise the generosity of the great british public by create an innovative new afghan housing portal which enable conscientious landlord to offer their rental property directly to family furthermore each local authority that receive an afghan family can access per person over three year to provide wraparound integration support as well as additional funding for english language class urge local authority to continue take full advantage of the generous funding offer the government have put in place as tell the house in july the government have make time limit interim accommodation available to minority of family that be available only to those for whom move would disrupt ongoing medical treatment at specific hospital and those who have be pre match to property that will be available before the end of december as of august over of those in time limit interim accommodation be already match to property we have already see over people move out of interim accommodation and into settle accommodation with more leaving every week as have set out the overwhelming majority of afghans have now move into settle accommodation or be pre match to property that be testament to the significant central government support that have be put in place despite that support however some family have move into temporary accommodation under local authority homelessness provision that be less than of the people we have relocate from afghanistan of those family in temporary accommodation around quarter have property to move into in the come week other in temporary accommodation have regrettably turn down suitable offer of accommodation have be clear and honest from the outset that where that happen another government offer will not be forthcoming at time when there be many pressure on the taxpayer and the housing market it be not right that people can reject perfectly suitable offer of accommodation and expect to remain in taxpayer fund hotel however in recognition of the pressure council may face as result of housing afghans in temporary accommodation an additional per household have be make available to council by central government that be in addition to the wide billion available over three year to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping let be clear we have not leave afghan family without roof over their head continue to work closely with central and local government partner to help the small minority of family in local authority provide temporary accommodation to find settle accommodation across the united kingdom however we must all continue to play our part in deliver help hand to our afghan friend to whom we owe so much encourage those who can do so to offer private rent accommodation speak to their local council or list their property on the government afghan housing portal which remain operational we also take seriously our commitment to resettle afghans yet to arrive in the uk include those eligible for our scheme who be still in afghanistan however our effort to move people out of hotel have show how vital it be that they be move directly into long term settle accommodation where they can put down root in the community that be why we be take forward plan to source suitable accommodation ahead of facilitate new arrival welcome people who come to the uk through safe and legal route have always be and will always be vital way in which our country help those in need in that spirit look forward in the month ahead to welcome more of those who loyally serve alongside the uk armed force in afghanistan as well as those who stand up for british value often at great personal risk commend this statement to the house thank the minister for advance sight of the statement today statement be though continuation of shameful saga of government failure when it come to the afghans who serve alongside our force in afghanistan the minister have come here today look for pat on the back for boot people out of hotel but he fundamentally misunderstand that across this house we give commitment to those who serve alongside our force that we would do right by they when they arrive on our shore and that despite many now be in permanent home that commitment be still not be deliver thousand be still wait in limbo in pakistan and thousand be still wait for family reunion despite have be ask repeatedly whether his eviction scheme would make any family homeless the minister have today confirm that afghans in bridge hotel be access local authority homelessness support the opposition be proud of our armed force and of the afghans who serve alongside they in the year in afghanistan pay tribute to all those involve in operation pitting but our commitment be give not just to those who come out on those plane they be give to people who serve alongside our force and who work for they it be that wide commitment that the minister have not address in his statement and that would like to ask more about agree with he that afghans should not have be leave in bridge hotel but his government decide to do that for month where be the apology from he for that policy of neglect would be grateful if the minister could now provide more detail on number of question first how many afghans and their family be still in form of time limit accommodation approve by the minister government when do he expect that figure to be zero for any new arrival on the approve scheme as tiny as those number be will they be place in bridge accommodation or will they automatically be give home straight away how will that work will the financial package for the eviction also apply for those new and future arrival and how much have be set aside for that the minister have give no detail in any of his statement to the house about how much this eviction process have cost taxpayer in total and he have not say where that money be come from be it from the ministry of defence the home office or the tiny budget of the office for veterans affairs how much in total do he estimate will be spend in clear up the government mess after leave afghans in hotel for month why be there nearly afghans wait more than two year for their arap application to be process what be the ministry of defence do to get nearly arap eligible people and their family who be still in afghanistan out of harm way from the taliban how many afghans be still in hotel accommodation in pakistan pay for by the uk taxpayer how many of they have be tell that the uk government will not be pay their bill in the future what be the government do to get the people to whom we make promise out of pakistan and to safety in the united kingdom the minister use some unclear language in his statement when he talk about how many people be in temporary accommodation under local authority homeless provision he say it be less than of in july challenge he to say that no afghan family who help our force in afghanistan would be homeless because of his policy of eviction the minister say at the time that give what be on offer there be no reason why afghans should present as homeless at the end of this process official report july vol we can see that now would it not be clear if the minister rather than say less than of say that people be access homelessness provision because of his policy can he give precise number of how many afghans whom he have evict be access the homelessness provision of local authority up and down the country we give solemn pledge that we would support those people who serve our armed force the minister be smile at that commitment but people access homelessness support be not something to smile about this be not the opportunity for giggle on the front bench this be an opportunity for we to be take seriously as nation because we promise people who arrive in the united kingdom people flee the taliban in afghanistan and those still in pakistan that we would provide safety he have do some of that with his eviction policy but more need to be do interruption know he be find this funny and he be giggle on the front bench but this be not funny know all too well from the casework have be do for afghan there be lot of attack come from those on the government benches but this be serious point so let finish know all too well from the casework be do for afghan family and interpreter base in plymouth in my constituency that they have family member on the run from the taliban in afghanistan who still fear for their life we give solemn promise to some of those people that we would get they out can the minister set out how we will get those people out and how we will bring they to safety because that serious promise deserve to be honour the minister want praise on this matter but he should have apologise for the myriad government failure there be chance now to address all of they not just his eviction policy but the issue of those in pakistan and afghanistan and those who still do not have the safety and promise of safety that we offer that be pretty embarrassing from the hon gentleman it be disappointing to receive typically unpleasant response to the hundred of people who have work across the country to deliver this policy stand in this house and promise that we would close bridge hotel which be totally unsuitable for afghans by august have do that we have deliver on that promise say that nobody would sleep rough and nobody have sleep rough throughout this process the new arrival that he talk about as he well know be not within the scope of this statement he well know that those question will not be answer today the hon gentleman talk about the funding that have be throw at this issue if he have be listen to anything that go on rather than read out some student statement in the house of commons he would know that none of the million come from the ova budget he say that budget be tiny but it do not exist at all under his party and his party have no plan to replace it it be not tiny in the first place will not spend lot of time on this answer because it be an incredibly disappointing response to serious issue nobody on the government benches be laugh he come up with these clip for his social medium platform and it be embarrassing for the rest of we this government be commit to deliver on our responsibility when it come to migration we promise that we would close bridge hotel by august indicate dissent the hon gentleman shake his head because he live in different world all the bridge hotel be closed and nobody have sleep rough be proud of the team that have deliver that we have not do it for he or for pat on the back from the labour party we have do it because it be the right thing to do for the afghan people because on this side of the house we believe in something and in do right by these people and we will deliver on our promise to they as we continue into the future thank the minister for deal appropriately with the response from the opposition front bench during the next week would like he or one of his colleague to follow up the case that raise with the leader of the house last thursday an international security assistance force commander say of that person that he because of his service in support of the nato armed forces in the afghan theatre of combat operations have suffer and continue suffer threat to the life and property of himself know that be not for the minister to answer today but make that request want to be approach by the right person to find out how we can solve that problem my office will have hear that today we will ensure that that individual case see my hon friend question last week be raise with my office we will do everything we can to provide he with an answer and to see where we go from there sabir zazai the chief executive of the scottish refugee council have say for every afghan person who arrive in the uk on resettlement scheme in the year end march almost cross the channel in small boat this be sign of government who be fail in their commitment to afghans every afghan on boat should have be able to reach here by the scheme that the government have set up it be sign of failure that they have not the government promise to resettle afghan refugee in the first year and over the come year but since that announcement only have be newly resettle under the afghan citizen resettlement scheme and the scheme be now apparently dormant despite great need for they to give an example prior to the taliban takeover of afghanistan the western isles base charity the linda norgrove foundation be support female student include study medicine those woman be not allow to continue their study in afghanistan and have go from be trainee doctor to house helper despite that five scottish medical school be very supportive of allow afghan student to travel to scotland and complete their study and all have agree to offer they place yet the acrs have not reopen despite the uk government say that it would within year there be no commitment for these woman to come to scotland despite the place be there and those woman be welcome and ask the minister to reflect on that people have be leave behind have dozen of family get in touch with at the fall of afghanistan desperate to get their relative out but know of only handful who be able to make it to scotland the minister have leave they behind can he tell about the acr how many expression of interest have the government receive on the scheme how many of those be sit in pile yet to be process because my constituent have hear nothing about their expression of interest move to the situation of afghans in hotel understand from the local msp and cabinet secretary jenny gilruth that afghans be give notice to quit from hotel in glenrothes she be aware of no impact assessment and no discussion with local authority prior to that decision be make when she raise the matter with the minister for immigration she get nothing but pat response with no detail on what she have raise that be clearly not acceptable from the government they need to do much well if that be the level of engagement we all know from our casework that there be lot of reason why people might not take up the first offer of accommodation they be give be the minister confident that people do not have legitimate reason such as family tie or link to the local community or many other reason why they do not want to be thrust out of the accommodation they be in and into somewhere with which they be completely unfamiliar and without support network that will cause far more damage in the long run rather than support people properly which the government be clearly fail to do do reflect on what the hon member say in term of individual who remain in afghanistan she will know of my concern in that space this statement be clearly about those who be here and those for whom we have to do huge job of work to get out of hotel and into accommodation there be an extensive engagement process with local authority have all the local authority on call many time and meet many of they face to face so it be simply not correct that people do not have notice be happy to go away and look at her case but can guarantee that the answer be that the hotel be give notice and that there be home office worker in that hotel because ensure that there be in every one this have be an incredibly difficult process but what will not allow to happen be traduce of the work of those official in the department for levelling up housing and communities and the home office who work throughout the summer day and night to ensure that we meet the target they have do an extremely good job nobody would begin to think that afghanistan be anything but human tragedy of epic proportion and we be try to salvage what we can from that as for my comment on future movement it be right that individual come here and go into settle accommodation and not into hotel because hotel be unsuitable as we have see time and again as have say the government will honour our commitment to those who serve thank my right hon friend for his statement will he join in encourage council and legally resettle afghans to utilise broad mainstream support such as english language class and unemployment support in particular through department for work and pensions work coach absolutely in august we spend lot of time go around these hotel explore and then confirm some of the support available to afghans in different area much of that support be include in the package with per family and per person we then have the integration fund over three year and there be per person per day for up to six month for those still in temporary accommodation so there be every opportunity for these afghans to properly integrate into british society to learn english and those wrap around skill and to build decent life in the uk as we promise they when we evacuate they in operation pitting the statement be on afghan resettlement so hope that the minister can assist what progress have be make with council and other accommodation provider to bring to the uk the cohort of arap approve afghans wait in third country have he consider homes for ukraine style scheme understand what the right hon member be get at my responsibility be clearly to get these individual out of hotel so that we could begin that process of bring people in afghanistan who need to be here back to the uk all option be be consider in that space the government recognise that there be people in afghanistan we owe and who should be in the uk and we will have more to say on that in due course pay tribute to my right hon friend for his leadership and co ordination across government departments in secure such positive outcome the vale of glamorgan have be proud to play its part afghan family be originally locate in the copthorne hotel in wenvoe in my constituency and be now settle and welcome in st athan in my constituency proud community with many service personnel recently meet many of those afghan family some be translator some be intelligence officer and some be security guard at the british embassy in afghanistan when time permit will he agree to come and meet those family so that he can well understand the network need locally with the department for work and pensions the jobcentre and social service so that there can be well understanding of the practical need on the ground as well as to recognise the gratitude they be show to the uk for that support would love to come and see that work take place know that where individual have engage with the government and the scheme there be some incredible story of how afghans have relocate into these community one of the thing we do be build taskforce of afghan national who be drive people around community in the uk and introduce they to landlord we really do see something quite special over the summer in that join up effort to meet this challenge would love to come down to see that the government commitment to this be endure there be no point in do this and then in three year find there be problem with afghans sleep rough and will personally see it through thank the minister again for visit the afghans at the hotel in cardiff with few month ago will he join in pay tribute not only to the staff of his department and other but to the staff of vale of glamorgan council cardiff council and the welsh government who work co operatively to try to ensure that they find home will he give the exact statistic on how many people be homeless at the end he promise that none would be but understand that small number in cardiff and the vale be if he do not have that to hand perhaps he could write to what have be do on equivalency of qualification at that meeting many of the afghans raise with he that they can not get job because their qualification from afghanistan be not be recognise what have he do with the dwp to resolve that will come back to the hon member on equivalency in due course there be an issue with get the healthcare worker we want to see into the nhs and we be work on that at the moment promise that no one would be sleep rough at the end of the process but never promise that nobody would not apply for homelessness can not force people to live in certain house however can ensure he that nobody sleep rough because of this policy or lack of provision that target be meet and nobody sleep rough of course pay tribute to all the local authority some of they do extraordinary stuff during the period go on holiday myself but there be other people on holiday still drive around at at night introduce people to community pay tribute to those from party of all colour across the united kingdom it really be galvanising of national effort if we do that in future we can meet the strategic challenge on migration thank the minister for his statement know that he care deeply about this in the light of the afghan resettlement update know this fall slightly without his remit to what extent be the government put pressure on the afghan regime about girl and woman education with it be two year since the ban he mention that there be the opportunity locally for afghans to learn english and we know how important that be for integration what estimation do he make of that funding so far in their integration thank my hon friend for his question there be fund available to do english course and every afghan who have come over have have access to those course we be get to the point with afghans have be in the united kingdom for two year where they should be speak english and we have make real effort to ensure that happen on afghan politic have work out that the critical thing when work cross departmentally whether on veteran or this issue be that we have to respect the lane we be in that be clearly an issue for the foreign office which be sure will have hear my hon friend question he can approach it for more detail thank the minister very much for his update and for the work that have be do it quite clearly sound good have constituent who work alongside an afghani and that outstanding case for resettlement have be turn down will not name the person in the chamber because would not want to compromise he in any way but can not for the life of understand how the scheme have be apply to that gentleman who be currently in danger have flee the taliban he work alongside the british army my constituent tell all about his duty and what he do and be quite clear about it in my mind this gentleman alongside his wife and four child be live in afghanistan and in danger from the taliban and other he help the uk force our force when we beckon and ask for that help surely the operation of the scheme must allow for compassion and common sense may seek the minister help mean that honestly for that honourable gentleman who we can not let down ask the hon member to write to about that individual today be more than happy to sit down and explain the process to he look at that case and see whether it have go right or wrong we know that there be people in afghanistan who deserve to be here and who we want to be here the previous defence secretary my right hon friend the member for wyre and preston north mr wallace mention it number of time the government be aware of that and he will know my personal commitment to that pay tribute to hounslow council my local council the feltham convene partnership and other who have play such an important role in support afghan refugee when the minister come to the house in march and announce that afghans would be evict from uk hotel about half the afghans in hotel accommodation be child will he update the house on how many of those child be now settle in permanent housing as well as on the ongoing strategy for the continuity of their education include the resource need for that such as for trauma and other support the support go forward be extensive as allude to early there will be per family with specific reintegration funding of per person to make sure that happen we have that deadline by september because do not want people take out of school half these people be child and they should not be in hotel some of the scene witness at those hotel be unacceptable be determined that we stick to that deadline because it be the compassionate thing to do in the end pay tribute to everyone at hounslow council which have visit for do great job that show that if we all work together on these issue and take politic out of it we can meet the challenge of strategic migration let start by put on record my thank to the immigration minister the right hon member for newark robert jenrick who after month of beg by and my team be finally persuade to help bring five british child and their afghan mother to safety in the

into it on friday have the privilege of visit the refugee and migrant centre in birmingham will the minister join in pay tribute to its great work in housing afghan evacuee the issue now be that rent have go up quite significantly and the centre be find it difficult to house people and give they some sort of normality in the community will he look at this issue urgently the pressure on housing across the united kingdom be well know that be why we design clever scheme to increase the local housing allowance and combine it with the local authority housing fund and at the same time blend that with service family accommodation provision to make sure that we could deal with the increase as say this be not fire and forget issue this nation have an endure commitment to those family we want to get they into settle accommodation because that be their good opportunity to get job they have right to work and to build life in the uk these be talented people pay tribute to those in birmingham and across the country for lean into this task and be grateful for their effort commend the government on the way in which they set up the ukraine family scheme within week of the russian invasion but the parallel family reunion mechanism for afghans resettle or call forward for evacuation under pathway of acrs be still not implement have more than afghan family in my constituency who be desperate to be reunite with family two year on those family still have no way of bring their love one to safety believe the minister may know of the case that have speak about before in the chamber of constituent who send the photograph of his year old daughter in her coffin she commit suicide for fear of what the taliban would do to she but her four sister and their mother be still there under pathway afghans here have be give indefinite leave to remain but that mean that they can not avail themselves of refugee family reunion anyone apply for that be tell that their application have be reject as invalid will the minister please increase the number of official deal with family reunion it be matter of honour but also of huge personal commitment be always look at what more we can do in this space it be easy to forget the depth of the carnage in afghanistan we have someone in the scheme who be force to sell one of his child he email we and say be go to have to sell my child tomorrow and he do it be horrific that be why we all need to lean in and work as hard as we can what have happen there be extraordinary we will continue to lean into that and do what we can in these horrific situation the

course my constituent brother train and fight alongside uk force he escape murder by the taliban by flee across the border injure and without paper can the minister confirm how many afghans have be relocate from third country under pathway and of the resettlement scheme and explain why his government still require those ally to seek new documentation from the man try to kill they or to arrive on small boat those scheme lie with the home office and the immigration system be sure that his question will have be hear it be clear that challenge remain in this space as be allude to in the previous question the consequence of get it wrong that we be deal with be particularly horrific we recognise our commitment and will work continue to work hard to fulfil they birmingham city council with your permission mr deputy speaker would like to make statement about birmingham city council birmingham be great city with wonderful diverse creative and enterprise population it have real economic cultural and educational strength but birmingham city council have not serve the citizen of that great city as it should have for year now the city have suffer as the council have fail to grip underperformance poor leadership weak governance woeful mismanagement of employee relation and ineffective service delivery have harm the city senior leader both elect member and officer have come and go but the one constant have be failure to deliver for resident who deserve well believe strongly in local government local decision making and devolution of power to local community but also believe that when failure in local government occur we must act as we devolve more power to local government overall we must demand sharp accountability the need for action in birmingham be press on september the council chief financial officer issue section notice which set out the full gravity of its financial situation as result and as will set out to the house be satisfied that birmingham city council be fail to comply with its good value duty in line with the local government act therefore can announce that be today write to the council to set out my proposal to intervene and to appoint commissioner and that intend to launch local inquiry in due course do not take those decision lightly but it be imperative to protect the interest of the resident and taxpayer of birmingham and to provide ongoing assurance to the whole local government sector copy of the letter have be provide to the vote office and will be deposit in the house of commons library and publish on it may be helpful to the house if outline how we in government arrive at this position in the independent kerslake report commission after the trojan horse investigation into number of birmingham school find that successive administration have fail the city it warn that the council lack clear vision have fail to tackle deep root problem such as the low level of skill and be not do enough to provide consistently good quality service the report author the late lord kerslake also highlight culture of sweeping problem under the carpet or blame they on other rather than tackle they head on the problem lord kerslake identify have unfortunately endure in april the minister for local government the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire lee rowley ask the then council leader councillor ian ward to commission an independent governance review he be prompt to act after governance and service delivery concern be raise by three independent source the local government and social care ombudsman the housing ombudsman and the department for education commissioner for special educational need and disability at the council the scope of the review be then extend to include two further serious issue which subsequently come to light the flawed implementation of new financial ledger system oracle and the council handling of its significant equal pay liability the council response to both issue have cause concern highlight significant shortcoming in its governance arrangement and in its ability to identify and resolve area of weakness last month my hon friend write again to the leader seek assurance about whether the council be compliant with its good value duty in relation to decision on equal pay and oracle to date there have be no response we understand that number of factor lead the chief financial officer of the council to issue the section notice last tuesday as lay out in the report these include concern raise by the external auditor grant thornton around the provision for equal pay in prior year account the independent auditor assessment be that the revise estimate equal pay liability be likely to be more than million and there be risk it could be much high that mean in turn that the and account be materially mis state and that the council do not have sufficient reserve to mitigate the cost of the liability due for those year in addition to the acute financial position stem from equal pay the council be deal with other difficulty they include the cost of resolve the botched oracle implementation estimate at million the resident and business of birmingham deserve well the intervention package be propose today be form of two complementary part first propose to issue statutory direction to the council and appoint commissioner to exercise certain function of the council as require secondly intend to launch local inquiry to consider the more fundamental question around how birmingham get to this position and option for how it can become sustainable council move forward that secure good value for its resident be propose the transfer to the commissioner of the exercise of all function associate with the council governance and scrutiny of strategic decision making and all function relate to senior appointment as part of the propose direction the council would under the oversight of the commissioner prepare and agree an improvement plan within six month which would set out the council own plan to make the necessary improvement to the whole council to return it to sustainable financial footing the commissioner will provide advice and challenge to the council across its operation and will have power to make decision directly should they deem that necessary my hope be that the commissioner would not need to use all those power none the less they must in my view have the necessary mandate to deliver the reform that be require the commissioner will give and will in turn give the house progress report at regular interval judge that the scale and nature of the failing at the council its precarious financial situation and its failure to provide sufficient assurance to government that it be take adequate action to address these issue be all highly concerning acknowledge that the council be work with the local government association on its own proposal on improvement and have meet the leader of the council to hear his plan but in accordance with the legislation have now inform the council that be minded to implement the package set out today to protect the interest and service of the people of birmingham and have give the council five work day to make representation on the proposal have set out today be specifically minded to appoint max caller an experienced local government professional and commissioner to lead the intervention will also welcome representation from member of this house and other who may wish to contribute their view thank birmingham mps for their engagement over the course of the last week especially my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield gary sambrook who have be particularly closely engage with the issue throughout it be important that we all get to the bottom of how we find ourselves in this position that be why as well as send in commissioner be today make it clear that we need local inquiry that can look at all the deep question include by assess the council ongoing management of issue identify in the kerslake review in and the subsequent non statutory intervention we will consider option for how birmingham can improve in the future should make it clear that everything be say today be not reflection on the many hard work staff at birmingham city council who continue to deliver essential frontline service for birmingham resident birmingham be not the only council where we have see significant local failure there have be problem in recent time at liverpool sandwell slough nottingham thurrock woking and croydon the government have not hesitate to act where poor decision making and governance have be identify the newly establish office for local government our performance body for england will have an important role to play in future where local authority be identify as be at risk of potential failure it will bring council leader together with other in local government to explore problem in more detail tougher scrutiny be vital when more decision making and budget be pass from central government into the hand of local politician and official when local leader fail it be citizen who be let down whose rubbish be not collect whose library can not open and whose vulnerable people be not adequately protect birmingham record be of ineffective inefficient and unaccountable local government despite our good effort and significant support that need to change will take whatever step be necessary to uphold the good name of local government and to protect the resident of that great city commend this statement to the house thank the secretary of state for the advance copy of his statement today it have be while since we face each other day to be exact lot have change since then we be on our third prime minister our fourth chancellor and of course our sixth different minister for housing they have crash the economy family face the bad cost of live for generation and mortgage rate have increase nearly fivefold since our last meeting but one thing have not change local government have be push to the brink birmingham be just the big late example this be deeply worrying time for people in the city the issue face the council be difficult and complex and administration of all three major political party have grapple with they in the year since they emerge since may the new leadership in birmingham have be work urgently on this issue and have be clear that they will take responsibility for tackle the problem face their city but they can only make that progress if the secretary of state treat they as partner and not as political football welcome the comment the secretary of state have lay out today in regard to the action and support he will give birmingham but can he assure we that the commissioner will work with the city elect representative and leadership to tackle these problem together be his department consider similar approach to other struggle council will his official be take deep dive into the area he mention in his statement in birmingham case the secretary of state mention the large equal pay settlement as the straw that break the camel back but he also tell we that governance and service delivery concern be raise by three independent source the local government and social ombudsman the housing ombudsman and the department for education commissioner for special educational need and disability that come after lord kerslake review which find that successive administration have fail the city yet he provide no support until the section notice why do it take that for the government to take action on this scale like the rest of the country birmingham be face the shock of spiral inflation and battle cost of living crisis but in the face of all of this the government strip away its reserve can the secretary of state confirm that that amount to billion take from the pocket of local community over the last decade he surely can not deny that birmingham have experience some of the most severe cut of the last year and he must recall that it be this prime minister who boast of change the funding formula to take money away from deprived urban area now face with an eye water equal pay claim with which the leadership be rightly deal birmingham have be push over the edge as the secretary of state admit this be by no mean single case local authority across the country be struggle and after year he can not seriously say that it be all their own fault perhaps he can confirm that only one council issue section notice before his party take office in and that since then eight council have issue notice with warning that another be at risk of bankruptcy over the next two year can he tell we why so many local authority of all political stripe have already issue section notice on his watch this be not one off so what work be his department do to support local authority that be warn of financial distress now the truth be this crisis in local government have be cause by the conservatives wreck ball with every swing another local council be push to the brink and another local community fall over the edge that be the difference between we labour government would oversee sustainable long term funding for council and we would work with local authority and push power wealth and opportunity out of westminster the secretary of state finish his statement by talk about uphold the good name of local government surely we can all agree that central government have real question to answer will the secretary of state finally grasp the nettle and take responsibility or be his message to local council today that this be just the start of more misery to come it be great pleasure to be reunite with the right hon lady those day apart seem much long we have certain thing in common both of we have be trade union organiser in the past but she have be much more successful in internal party election than have ever be so do have lot to learn from she nevertheless must politely remind she that while in my statement be hope careful and scrupulous in make clear that responsibility go back quite some time in birmingham and responsibility do need to be share between elect member and official do not mention anything specifically or explicitly party political because believe it be vital that we work together across party and across political tradition to deal with this issue give that the right hon lady do mention the party politic of this think it important for we to recognise that the intervention in birmingham and our intervention in sandwell and liverpool have all be intervention in labour lead local authority in which comprehensive mismanagement extend back over year it be simply not good enough to say that birmingham have not receive the support that it need birmingham have core spending power of million that be increase in the last year and increase since labour local authority have be support with funding and also support with the help of west midlands combined authority there be striking factor in the west midland why be it that labour sandwell and birmingham be fail while the conservative leadership of andy street have see the delivery of record investment and record house building if people want to draw political lesson from what we have see in birmingham the message be very clear if you want effective and efficient local government trust in conservative leadership particularly at time when we need to recognise that fundamental problem afflict birmingham finance be an equal pay problem exacerbate by the action of trade union trade union which in many case be fund front bench spokesman for the labour party it be vital that labour politician use their influence to ensure that we can work together to deal with the problem that that great city face welcome the statement it be right that the secretary of state be take this decisive action in relation to commissioner so that we can get to the bottom of what have actually happen in birmingham city council but can he give some reassurance that neighbour local authority such as dudley and sandwell and council tax payer will not be pick up the cost of the failure of the labour administration in birmingham can he also reassure that project relate to transport infrastructure and employment creation and skill will not be put in jeopardy by the failure of that labour administration my hon friend make an important point of course there be real issue for sandwell as local authority which be why we have to intervene there to deal with year of mismanagement but it be also the case that council tax payer elsewhere in the west midland must not be on the hook for failure that occur in birmingham we will have some tough decision to make central government be prepared to extend additional financial support to the city but our commissioner will be sure be confront the political leadership of birmingham city council with some necessarily difficult decision and hope that we can take they in constructive spirit together the secretary of state give list of council where section notice have be serve and commissioner have be bring in perhaps he can confirm that thurrock woking and northamptonshire be not labour control council he seem to miss that bit out when he be justify his attack on some council on the basis of their be labour control no doubt there have be problem in all these council but do the secretary of state accept there be some overarch responsibility for government who deliver austerity to council big cut than in any other part of the public sector and that while by and large local government have manage extremely well some council have go over the edge do he also accept that other council may now be face the brink he have an expert unit in his department advise he can he tell we how many council he think be now on the brink of section notice and what action he will take to help they in advance be always grateful to the chairman of the select committee have already point out that in my statement deliberately do not choose to make political point but give that my wonderful shadow the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner do choose to insert some party political point think it only appropriate for to point out that liverpool sandwell slough nottingham and croydon have all be drive to the brink of bankruptcy by labour leadership it be important to give that context it be also important to say that while will of course continue to fight for local government finance and at the last spending review secure the big increase for over decade it be nevertheless incumbent on elect leader and officer to continue to deliver service efficiently that be why our new office for local government will hold council effectively to account while also highlight the good practice that be so widespread in local government and which see many council continue to deliver high quality service without get into the sort of trouble that birmingham have get into my right hon friend will know that unfortunately my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield gary sambrook can not be here today because of family matter but he like and like so many other in birmingham and the west midland want to make sure that this review in birmingham be different from some of the review that we have see elsewhere so that we can finally figure out how labour have repeatedly fail in birmingham in order to learn the lesson of the past but most importantly to protect local service for the future be grateful to my hon friend we must deepen this inquiry it be fair to say that it be conservative and liberal democrat administration that run birmingham until but over the last year there have be succession of labour leader do not for moment move away from the fact that there be way in which the conservative liberal democrat administration before be not perform as it should have be but this deterioration particularly when it come to the issue of equal pay have occur on labour watch can ask two question of the secretary of state first he mention one person he be minded to appoint as commissioner when will he tell we who else he have in mind secondly will the secretary of state commissioner power to make decision directly extend to make decision to raise council tax and to sell off asset belong to the people of birmingham be glad that max caller have agree to be lead commissioner but in the next few day want to hear directly from birmingham mps and other representative about who they believe can act as effective commissioner alongside max caller be completely open to thought and suggestion from hon member and other about how we can build the most effective and coherent team it have sadly be the case in the past with local authority that have fail such as croydon and slough that we have need both to increase council tax in certain circumstance and to dispose of asset but it be too soon to say what the precise mix of intervention that may be require be want to do everything to protect birmingham council tax payer and resident by make sure that service can continue move back to birmingham after graduate choose to do so in be former president of the chamber of commerce and former local enterprise partnership director we have one of the most successful leps in the area and to say that be disappoint by what have go on in birmingham be an understatement not least because it have have over decade to get to grip with this issue do my right hon friend agree though that there be two story in birmingham there be the story of the political failure that we be see at the council but there be also the story of the young ever city in europe thrive with the large amount of start up outside london massive life science sector and an advanced manufacturing sector this success be happen under the leadership of andy street will my right hon friend also confirm that my council solihull council which have project with birmingham will remain unaffected by what be go on there my hon friend have have distinguished career in business and public service in the west midland it be right to say as seek to do at the beginning of my statement that birmingham as city have so many strength we can be proud of its people and of its achievement economically educationally and in so many other way the commonwealth game show birmingham very much at its good this be specific problem that relate to the council it require focused action and the support of the west midlands combined authority of andy street and of other will be vital in resolve this situation there should be no adverse impact on resident in solihull and will continue to work with my hon friend and other representative of solihull to ensure that that local authority continue to get the support it deserve obviously this be not situation that anyone would want to be in want to understand exactly how the commissioner will work while everyone be make party political point it be actually the people of birmingham who vote for the council and who have put those people in place will the citizen of the city get any intervention in this process how be their feeling go to be hear or be they just go to have thing do to they by people who let face it do not live in birmingham or know what the city be like do not know this fella believe he work in hackney he do not live in birmingham he do not know anything about what the city be like and the secretary of state praise for andy street make think that he have never try to get on the tram in digbeth we can not just have steamrollering in the city there have to be some level of accountability also for the commissioner and wonder what system that will work on have to ask the secretary of state what be it about the last year that mean he can reel off list of council include thurrock northamptonshire and woking believe that his own council be not in crack shape what be it about the last year that have mean they have all show crack in the roof there be several important point there have never take tram in digbeth but do know that thank to andy street there be significant additional investment in digbeth and that the bbc be move there it be thank to andy street that we be see business and culture flourish in the west midland max caller be uniquely experienced figure in local government in slough he manage to deal with many of the defect that have occur under be afraid labour administration have talk to the hon lady and other birmingham mps be very open to they as birmingham elect representative co operate with to help identify who should join max as commissioner the explicit reason that be minded to act in this way and that have announce only one name be to get the maximum possible consensus and buy in for strong team that can take the step require what have happen over the last year be afraid we have to look at individual council and the decision making within they and to recognise that there be well run council shall not name they here but there be even one or two well run labour council but it be important to recognise that this be about the quality of local leadership which as we devolve more power down have to rise to the challenge like many colleague in the west midland seek reassurance that my constituent in wolverhampton will not be impact by knock on effect through the west midlands combined authority do my right hon friend agree that hard work people pay their council tax to get the essential do and that birmingham which know it be in financial trouble spend million on trade union facility time last year seem an expense too far for hard work people thank my hon friend for do such fantastic job for wolverhampton even though may not always agree with everything that wolverhampton council have do it have have some distinguish labour figure lead it in the past more broadly there have be consistent failure to deal effectively with employee relation and trade union issue in birmingham we talk about equal pay and of course equal pay matter but what we have see be failure to effectively confront this liability early enough and failure to deal fairly and robustly with trade union birmingham be the eighth local authority to declare section notice since the tories take power cause huge concern to my resident in erdington kingstanding and castle vale across the uk council be struggle with rise price and limited budget and most be be force to make even deep cut next year can the secretary of state accept that local leader need certainty about their budget and reassure the house today that every local council will be properly fund by central government absolutely we do ensure that every council be appropriately fund know that the hon lady serve with distinction on birmingham city council so would exempt she from any criticism but do not exempt from criticism other who have serve and continue to serve on birmingham city council if we look at each of these specific local authority we see failure that require to be acknowledge failure that even the current labour leader have be good enough to acknowledge that be why we need to work together and why this intervention be require the sad case of birmingham city council will worry my constituent as the secretary of state know warrington borough council labour run council have borrowing of almost billion which be time its core spending power my constituent and worry about the governance of warrington borough council and about the return on investment that have be make by the council be also deeply worried that councillor in warrington do not understand the decision they have take and the exposure they have put my constituent under each constituent be now in debt to the tune of because of those decision can my right hon friend set out the step his department be take to prevent another collapse at labour run council give that that could occur in warrington next know that the minister for local government the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire lee rowley have be pay close attention to what have be happen in warrington and we will report back to my hon friend the member for warrington south andy carter and to the house on that he be absolutely right to raise those concern as there be more work that we require to do to satisfy ourselves about the fundamental financial health of warrington the secretary of state have rightly mention the bob kerslake report of key finding of which be that the role of officer in birmingham have subdue the role of elect member john cotton the current council leader have rightly highlight the accounting and equal pay issue he want to make difference to resolve the issue with the officer will the secretary of state look to bring back the district auditor function so we can be much clear about the finance of local authority be grateful to the hon gentleman for the very constructive approach he have always take to deal with local government and education issue yes the kerslake report identify number of weakness include at officer level and yes it be also the case that the relatively new leader of birmingham city council john cotton have be honest about the need for improvement it be also the case as the hon gentleman rightly point out that we need to improve the audit function within local government overall the redmond report and other have point to the need to do so and believe that the new office for local government will provide an even more rigorous early warning system if thing be likely to go wrong as well as this be equally important celebrate those local authority of all political colour that be do good job so we can learn from they the problem we face in thurrock have emerge over the past year during decade in which thurrock have be dominate by three party politic and succession of minority administration in which the uk independence party hold the balance of power be brutally frank it be impossible to make financial cut or to increase council tax which have lead we to our current situation in the light of the good value inspection which find that the position have be exacerbate by annual election and constant electioneering will my right hon friend consider whether those lesson need to be read across local government remind he that go back as far as previous ministers the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy and the national audit office all warn thurrock of the recklessness of its policy yet councillor and officer fail to act do we need to consider statutory power for sanction in those circumstance my hon friend make series of very helpful point and she be right obviously it be not my role or responsibility at this time to interfere in the calendar of election that local government have enjoy acquire or inherit over the year but agree that wherever possible we should move away from annual election indeed the work to change the electoral geography and timing in liverpool have be helpful she be also right that the particular political dynamic in thurrock create difficulty and how we hold people to account in future need to be review my hon friend have be consistent voice in challenging underperformance at thurrock council and brave voice in attempt to face down populism in her constituency in order to do the very good for her constituent the situation face birmingham city council be very serious and those responsible should be hold to account none the less we know birmingham be not unique many council across the country as we have hear be enter section territory accord to report the secretary of state local council in surrey heath could go bankrupt within two year what assessment have he make of the financial situation face council and of the impact of the billion strip from birmingham city council budget by the government the overall health of local government matter hugely and the financial health of local government matter hugely that be why we be bring forward the new office for local government think the hon lady and will have to agree to disagree on the root cause of the problem in birmingham as say early birmingham core spending power have increase significantly and other local authority that have not see their core spending power increase by the same amount be manage their finance effectively but hope we can work together to ensure that wherever responsibility have lie in the past we may disagree on that we can serve the people of edgbaston and all of birmingham well in future labour run blackpool council currently have budget deficit of more than million which be one of the large in the country compare with its revenue budget despite this the council continue to fritter away taxpayer money not least in spend on six tree and in give councillor pay rise to ensure its financial position do not deteriorate far will the secretary of state join in urge the council to get the basic right to end its pursuit of ideologically drive project that be not support by resident and to end all wasteful spending immediately love blackpool and love tree but for six tree be tree some tree they must have in blackpool more seriously the local authority face challenge but blackpool two member have be very successful in secure additional central government expenditure to help to regenerate the centre of blackpool and to secure new investment whatever view one might take of blackpool council and it do seem as if it be pay slightly more for its tree than it could have pay in most garden centre central government have nevertheless show how partnership and level up can secure real change be grateful to the secretary of state for the offer to work together and that offer have be welcome by councillor john cotton this afternoon can the secretary of state tell we whether we can find way to have conversation about fair funding he be student of tory leadership campaign and like we he probably wince when he hear the prime minister say to one campaign meeting we inherit bunch of formula from the labour party that shove all the funding into deprived urban area that need to be undo start the work of undo that the truth be that rich council have take cut of about per head since whereas birmingham city council have take cut of time that amount there be conversation to be have about funding and be grateful that the secretary of state be consider one way to fix it by create levelling up zone and investment zone in east birmingham on land between the two high speed station can the secretary of state confirm that those plan will still go ahead have he consider create development corporation in east birmingham for which have argue for long time to lever in significantly large amount of money can we have conversation about how we support the combine authority too as he will know andy street budget face gap of million next year rise to million in couple of year time and currently there be billion black hole between the investment programme and the fund available to pay for it be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his very thoughtful question although we might disagree politically and have different reflection on what may have be say in the past he be absolutely right that we need to explore development corporation and that east birmingham in particular need additional investment he be also right that we need to work with the west midlands combined authority the recent trailblazer devolution deal give significant additional support to the west midlands combined authority and the mayor but we keep what be require under constant review the right hon gentleman be also right that birmingham economic health power the whole west midland and be vital to our overall success as nation which be why want to make sure that we get back to strong leadership and effective governance in birmingham call the chair of the public accounts committee welcome the appointment of max caller who have strong track record of make these difficult decision and help council to turn around but the secretary of state will know that task and finish be big part of what happen in birmingham do he have oversight of which other council be still do that nearly year ago at islington council we be look at those issue and tackle they the big issue here the elephant in the room be local audit some of audit opinion for the financial year have come in even with the extend deadline the permanent secretary and the national audit office have indicate that we need to focus on the current year and to forget previous year but these canary in the mine these warning sign be never hear because of the dire state of local audit this have all be on his government watch can he give we any reassurance that he really have plan to get local audit back on track first thank the hon lady for her kind word about max caller he be first class professional and know he will do an excellent job with the other commissioner secondly think it be fair to say do not want to make party political point that the local audit situation require both investment and leadership one of the first thing seek to do when arrive in the department be to ensure that the office for local government can play system leadership role in help to reform and improve that process completely agree with the hon lady on that the hon lady central point be about task and finish which some member may think sound like good thing task and finish group be team that set out to resolve problem and dissolve itself when the problem be finish it seem to be the model of what we should have in administration not permanent bureaucracy but taskforce however task and finish in birmingham and indeed in some other local authority have basically mean the binman the scaffie as we would say in scotland knock off early as soon as they have claim that they have finish their task and yet claim for their full work day again it be not an effective way to run any public service council across the country be struggle under severe financial constraint and there be no doubt that local government be badly underfunde however want to commend my bath north east somerset council for have show great prudence in order to rebuild its finance and hope the secretary of state will join in praise it the reform of the audit system have be mention but may ask he what timeline can we expect for reform of that system when do he think the backlog of unpublished opinion will be clear be grateful to the hon lady for that and have the great privilege of visit bath recently to look at housing development just as some labour council be good believe there be one or two liberal democrat council that be good although certainly shall not be name they at this dispatch box now more broadly we be take step to deal with the audit situation she mention and my hon friend the local government minister can brief she in detail should she wish about that situation the secretary of state mention core spending power so it be important to reflect on the first year of this conservative government when in every pound be strip away from local authority the government then force council to rely on council tax as central government funding be reduce place such as birmingham and luton can raise much less from council tax because of their small housing stock than wealthy area which have big house in high council tax band place such as birmingham and luton therefore lose out every year be his policy just result of incompetence or be it part of the prime minister state aim to take funding from deprived urban area and give it to wealthy town do not know how it be possible to sustain an argument that we be take funding from deprived area when one look at the levelling up partnership we have in hull sandwell blackpool blyth tiny amount tell that also to the people in middlesbrough redcar and cleveland who have benefit from strong conservative leadership and investment tell it to the people in workington walsall and willenhall all of they have benefit directly from the levelling up funding that this government have secure be there tough time in the first couple of year after yes why be there tough time it be because labour have leave we in situation where there be no money leave be afraid that the lesson of labour in central government be that it always leave office with unemployment high than when it enter and with the public finance devastate thank the secretary of state for his statement and for respond to the question particularly those from the local members point of order on point of order mr deputy speaker yesterday the canadian prime minister justin trudeau say that allegation that india be behind the assassination of hardeep singh nijjar be credible hardeep be prominent activist in the canadian diaspora campaign for independence for khalistan sikh have long suspect that india be behind the recent killing which appear to have be grotesque and completely illegal extra judicial expansion of modi government an authoritarian crushing of dissent within india itself urge our government to warn their indian counterpart that such state terrorism will not be allow to impact government to government relation as the house be due to rise may ask the government through your office to make an urgent statement on this important issue to assure sikhs in the uk of the government intention thank the hon gentleman for his point of order and his forward notice of it have receive no indication that any minister intend to make statement or statement far to those we have just have today but if that change member will be notify in the usual way however be certain that those on the treasury bench will have hear the point of order that the hon gentleman have make departmental response times levelling up housing and communities committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement those should be brief question and not speech may emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair and not to the relevant minister front benchers may take part in questioning if they so wish today the levelling up housing and communities committee have publish special report on the response time of the department for levelling up housing and communities to the committee report thank the backbench business committee for kindly grant time to our committee for statement on the special report and thank the committee staff for their support to assist we in produce it the house have appoint our committee to scrutinise the department the issue that our committee consider affect the day to day life of constituent up and down the country during this session we have publish report on topic such as adult social care housing supply and funding for level up we have also investigate damp and mould and reform to the private rented sector two issue that be raise on daily basis in correspondence to the committee and in our mailbag as constituency mp we have hear evidence from hundred of witness who have give up their time to share their experience in some case harrowing and deeply personal experience to inform the committee work they do so in the expectation that our report and recommendation will influence government policy and improve people experience of public service for our scrutiny of government policy to be fully effective the government must consider and respond to our conclusion and recommendation sometimes the government will accept our recommendation and sometimes they will not what be important be that we receive response from the government their response demonstrate that they have consider the view of the committee and allow the public to see what the government be do in response to our inquiry it be well establish convention that the government should respond to all select committee report within two month of publication we understand that that will not always be possible perhaps during parliamentary recess or where recommendation be direct to more than one department however delay should be the exception not the rule and we expect open and proactive communication from ministers and official on the rare occasion when they expect government response to be delay the experience of our committee be that the department for levelling up housing and communities have historically and consistently fail to respond to our committee report within reasonable time during this session we have publish seven report and not one of the government response have be publish within the two month deadline on average government response to our report have be almost six month late the response to our report on funding for levelling up on the electoral commission strategy and on exempt accommodation be all late the response to our report on adult social care be eight month late the response to our report on social housing be month late the response to our report on permit development right be one year and eight month late we be still wait on overdue response to our report on reform to national planning policy and on reform the private rent sector our committee staff spend disproportionate amount of their time resource and energy attempt to engage with ministers and official through formal and informal channel to get response over the year as chair of the committee have see response be late but thing have get progressively bad in march the chair of the liaison committee write to the then leader of the house to highlight case of egregiously overdue government response the department for levelling up housing and communities be identify as repeat offender when it come to late response and be responsible for five of the example in that letter in january this year we ask the permanent secretary about his department failure to respond he say we need to make sure that it be an important responsibility of the department that we respond on time we have see little evidence that the department have take this responsibility more seriously indeed in the case of our report on reform in the private rented sector publish in february the lack of response have be deeply disappointing the two month deadline pass on april on may the secretary of state write to the committee to explain that the delay response will be publish alongside the introduction of the renters reform bill the bill be introduce on may but we have still not receive response to the report instead we have hear that response will be publish as soon as possible we have make seven separate formal request for the response as well as many informal request but we be still wait for the government response it be now more than five month overdue the committee broadly support the legislation on private rental reform and have make suggestion for its improvement we now need to hear whether the government plan to accept these recommendation and if not why not we expect response in april we be promise one in may we be now in september and still wait we be also wait for the second reading of the bill we hope to receive the response before second reading although that appear to have be somewhat delay as well it be imperative that the government fully consider the committee conclusion and recommendation in the report and publish full response imminently our special report call for government response on the private rent sector in the next two week along with an explanation as to what have cause the delay we have request an assessment from the cabinet secretary about these matter finally we have ask the liaison committee to consider formal review of government response time include our experience with this department in reality select committee power and effectiveness be significantly undermine when the government do not fulfil their responsibility towards it minister must be accountable to this house we as committee treat our responsibility to scrutinise the department and its ministers with the utmost seriousness it be time that the department for levelling up housing and communities take its responsibility to our committee and the house equally seriously the first step in do so must be to respond to our principal output our report in professional and timely manner normally take great pleasure in come to the house to report on the committee inquiry and finding it give no pleasure at all to have to make this statement today hope do not have to make similar statement in the future there be now an opportunity for hon member to ask question of the chair of the select committee thank the chair of the select committee my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts and all its member for the valuable work they do shape challenge and scrutinise policy and hold people to account my constituent and those of many other hon member be wait with bated breath for reform to the private rent sector the committee have produce an excellent and powerful report about it but can clarify that response to that report have be request from the department on several occasion yes the committee work on cross party basis and our report on the prs be produce unanimously we have raise our concern about the delay response in person with ministers at our hearing and we have also write to ministers but still we have not have response take no pleasure in rise on the subject of the statement either have have the opportunity to serve on the committee and its predecessor for the last year since have be in parliament and over that period of time we have work very hard on cross party basis to make sure our recommendation be agree on cross party basis do the chair of the select committee agree that the government response to the committee report on exempt accommodation be some six month late give that be promote private member bill which have now become an act of parliament not have response from the government be hardly helpful in guide the house or the house of lords will he confirm that position and that many of the recommendation that the committee have make would have help the government to deliver much well service for all our constituent yes the hon gentleman be absolutely right he have serve on the committee all the time have be chair we have work together closely and he have do an absolutely outstanding job both on the homelessness reduction act and the supported housing regulatory oversight act which deal with exempt accommodation give that the committee undertake report on the issue of exempt accommodation it would have be really helpful not merely to the hon gentleman but to all member of the house who be look at that particularly challenging issue which we describe as complete mess if the government response to our report have be available in timely fashion as it could have inform the deliberation and consideration of the hon gentleman excellent bill in the end we get an act that be valuable and well support but the government do not help because of their delay in respond to our report thank you mr betts for your statement it be almost minute point of order be sure that member on the treasury bench will have hear the point that have be make not only by mr betts but by bob blackman import of dogs motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to prohibit the import of puppy age under six month to prohibit the import of pregnant dog in specify circumstance to prohibit the import of dog with cropped ear or dock tail and for connected purpose thank the charity dogs trust and the many charitable organisation that have do an amazing job engage with we as member of parliament over the year look out for the life of our four legged friend the issue of animal welfare be feel passionately by my constituent and be sure all our constituent around the country for many year my constituent have be get in touch with about the issue of cropped ear and puppy smuggling can understand why there be such strong feeling about the topic in move the motion declare an interest as be an avid dog lover myself have see at first hand the love comfort and sometimes the hard work that dog can bring to house be lucky enough to have two wonderful golden retriever willow and lola and two staffordshire bull terri cross snoopy and jazz who have be my constant companion for some time and be not alone in that regard indeed figure suggest that in the million household in the uk there be million dog which mean that almost half of all household in the uk own dog our status as nation of dog lover be plain for all to see last week when these very corridor of power be fill with bark and numerous wet nose be of course talk about the westminster dog of the year award where we have the chance to see our four legged friend up close and in action congratulate my hon friend the member for mid sussex mims davies and tj on their victory the conservative party manifesto outline how the government would crack down on the illegal smuggling of dog and puppy that commitment be reconfirm in the animal welfare kept animals bill understand that the government have be unable to progress with that bill because of the scale of the number of amendment that be propose so be proud to be introduce private member bill to enact the manifesto commitment myself the scale of the problem must not be underestimate the relaxation of the pet travel scheme in have lead to an exponential growth in illegal smuggling into the country the department for environment food and rural affairs estimate that before the relaxation some dog be smuggle into the country which have increase to in that increase in illegal dog have also cause an increase in the case of zoonotic disease include brucella canis that be risk to public health and the country biosecurity dogs trust have in recent year conduct five investigation which find that smuggler be use the pet travel scheme to cover up illegal activity in the uk the animal welfare kept animals bill have previously seek to stop illegal puppy trafficking by reduce the total number of animal allow to travel into the uk within year it also seek to increase the minimum age of import dog place restriction on pregnant dog and put complete ban on mutilate dog the original bill be design to make provision about the welfare of certain keep animal that be in import into or export from great britain however know that there be still determination in this house to right the wrong currently be perpetrate against animal to close the loophole that be available to smuggler which they continue to exploit and to strengthen the exist law and legislation this private member bill stand to do just that although wish have the time to acknowledge every member contribution would particularly like to thank the minister for international trade my hon friend the member for mid worcestershire nigel huddleston who have do incredible work lead up to this minute rule motion include hold his own westminster hall debate on puppy smuggling which be centre around the same issue that be try to address today back in when that debate be hold it gather vast support from all part of the house and hope that this bill will enjoy the same cross party support know that the british public certainly support this bill total of people have previously write in favour of its content and recent study by dogs trust find that of all respondent think that the government should fulfil our manifesto commitment to crack down on puppy smuggling in the past year alone puppy be find to be smuggle into the country as well as pregnant dog this transportation can have huge effect on dog mental emotional and physical health cause last trauma and health issue and that be if the dog survive the journey at all all of which can go on to cost many unsuspecting dog owner greatly both financially and emotionally as they seek to rectify such issue dog bring joy into our home but we need to make sure that we be not put traumatise dog into people house to illustrate the horrible journey that some of these dog have have to endure shall briefly outline the story of waffle and her nine sibling they be cram into shoebox and tie up for almost plus hour on mile journey from slovakia they have no food no rest and very little water the puppy be severely underweight and infest with worm when they be find at eight week they be barely half the current legal travel age of week waffle and her sibling be luckily rescue by dogs trust and have now all be take care of and rehome with love family however sadly more often than not puppy do not have such lucky outcome the bill would seek to put an end to such tragic story and improve the life of these dog as well as their owner it would seek to stop the premature importing of puppy and spare they from the often traumatic journey at such an incredibly formative point in their life it would also go far in help to disincentivise people from transport pregnant dog as well as hopefully put stop to the importation of mutilate dog send strong signal to stop the inhumane practice of cropping ear and dock tail although do recognise that the docking of tail be sometimes necessary in certain medical circumstance dog have be mankind companion for year to be precise the bonn oberkassel dog discover bury alongside two human in germany be believe to be the old example of the relationship between man and dog then there be the hunt dog of the palaeolithic era and the siberian sle dog of bc right through to the pet adorn many medieval painting and even more recently the brave four legged search and rescue team member dog have protect we help we provide companionship and even seek out lose friend and family now it be our chance to repay that companionship and that assistance by protect they that be what this bill do to conclude the bill set out to right the wrong currently be perpetrate to close the loophole that smuggler continue to exploit and to strengthen the exist law and legislation so that we can continue to give love to our four legged friend this would be the opportunity for anyone to speak against the minute rule motion have not be notify that anybody wish to do so would be amazed if they do so will put the question question put and agree to order that elliot colburn nick fletcher caroline nokes selaine saxby aaron bell matt vickers dr neil hudson sir robert buckland cat smith patricia gibson sarah champion and john mcdonnell present the bill elliot colburn accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday november and to be print bill backbench business conference adjournment beg to move that this house have consider matter to be raise before the forthcoming adjournment be speak on behalf of the backbench business committee the chair of which have ask to lead the debate in his absence start with some bad news namely on the ultra low emission zone we be all incredibly disappointed that despite the fact that the majority of londoners overwhelmingly oppose the expansion of ulez the out of touch megalomaniac mayor of london have go ahead regardless the measure have already have an absolutely devastating impact on thousand of people across outer london more than harrow east resident have sign my petition and share their view on this measure even after month of implementation signature be come in fast and more frequently than before the expansion the expansion have isolate the most vulnerable in society with elderly people unable to afford new vehicle have spend their pension on car when they retire they be now unable to make necessary journey go to the doctor the pharmacist or the hospital visit family or do grocery shopping without have to pay each day one resident recently write to they say disabled and my wife be pensioner and people will no long visit because of the ulez tax leave we isolate from family and friend how utterly tragic be that once the daily charge have be incur it be not even simple procedure to pay it this be heighten for the elderly who be notoriously less tech savvy that be assume that they have access to the internet in the first place if the charge be not pay within three day window fine be incur to complicate matter far there be an increase presence of scam website which be pose as transport for london to take ulez payment but be actually fraud with absolutely no association to tfl and it seem that no action be be take against they many of those on the low income typically work night shift be unable to update their car particularly as non compliant car have crash in value speak to some people at the weekend whose car be now worth less than even though they be perfectly serviceable vehicle public transport link at the time when people need to travel for night shift be also not available so just to get to work and back they be force to pay per shift each side of midnight that can not be describe as fair particularly as the mayor drive gas guzzle large land rover which be non compliant yet he have give himself an exemption so that he can continue to drive his car while incur no ulez cost what shamble the expansion will also drive up the cost of other service speak to gardener over the weekend who say that he now charge his customer on top of his daily charge just to get to work and back again furthermore many charity will lose out because volunteer will no long be able to get to the charity headquarters or deliver for local food bank yet again this lead to the most vulnerable lose out the ulez be only the late of barrage of ludicrous idea from the mayor of london recently launch consultation to hear the view of resident on his tenure and urge everyone to visit my website and submit their thought it have never be more important in my view to elect susan hall as the new mayor of london in the election next may move on now to the monstrosity that be edgware towers truly ridiculous proposal to build cluster of high rise building one block of storey and other in excess of storey in edgware broadwalk that would totally change the character of edgware morph it into canary wharf twin and overwhelm the current infrastructure it be important to note that be supportive of reasonable development but certainly not outrageous development such as this ballymore estates be try to put in an amount of housing that would take up the entire area of st james park on the space occupy by edgware bus station it be nonsense there be many ludicrous thing arise from the proposal construction would take more than year completely kill the small and medium sized enterprise on the high street the underground bus station pose major threat to people safety particularly woman and girl and then there be the fire safety issue with electric bus battery it would be the first place anywhere in the world where electric bus would be leave underground overnight there would also be very limited parking with none for resident and resident will need car to travel east to west it be all very well if they want to travel into the centre of london but if they want to travel anywhere else they will need car there will also be an impact on traffic because all around the area will have to be control parking zone hour day seven day week because there will be no control on the resident in those particular property the proposal completely ignore public opinion my recent survey receive more than response of which be against the proposal last week meet ballymore estates to discuss its unacceptable proposal it be fair to say that we have an interesting discussion but make clear my opposition to their plan the sheer scale of the development be complete codswallop and it be clear that the developer be not listen to the view of local people and business they plan to submit the application to the local authority by the end of september so it be vital that resident share their view and voice their objection as soon as possible again make clear that we be not against development we be just against development of the scale and density propose here be pleased recently to meet alex dewsnap the manage director of harrow council we discuss the way my office can work with the council to ensure well service for resident and swift and productive response to casework have to say that that have not always be the case when deal with harrow council be pleased that under the new conservative administration the council have begin comprehensive plan for road resurfacing across the entire borough ensure that the quality of road for resident be safe and not litter with pothole as have previously be the case as have raise in this chamber last year the labour council be complicit in huge corruption scandal with contractor and officer share million for themselves money that be earmark to fix dangerous pavement be frustrated that while the investigation continue the police be refuse to take action against the fraudster because they consider the crime to be too small be afraid that to million of taxpayer money be no small deal at all one of the principal problem for the council be house in multiple occupation with unscrupulous landlord falsify document and cram people into unacceptable tenancy so that many resident then complain about the antisocial behaviour of people live in those cramp condition be encourage that the council be look to buy house for use as social rent property and be take action to ensure that supply meet demand for vulnerable resident furthermore there be planning case await decision for new house to be build in the local area show that appropriate sensible and realistic development will always be support by local authority meet the need of resident and adhere to sustainable development quite contrary to edgware towers look at international issue the situation in iran remain at critical stage last saturday mark exactly year since the tragic murder of mahsa amini by the iranian revolutionary guard corps the devastating death of young lady for simply wear she hijab incorrectly mahsa legacy live on and the uprising in iran and by the diaspora around the world continue call for free and democratic iran she have inspire historic movement woman life freedom but the threat from iran remain over the last year more than political protester have be arrest and over execute furthermore the irgc continue to pose an unprecedented threat to the international community and to british interest across the world only week ago jointly host press conference with the national council of resistance of iran where my right hon friend the member for clwyd west mr jones reveal that have intercept more than terrorist attempt directly link to the irgc in the last year alone on top of that the home secretary have outwardly declare the irgc as the uk large security threat be encourage that the government have recently proscribe the wagner group while there have be progress from the government in introduce tough sanction on the irgc that be frankly not enough the settled view of all party in this house be that we must proscribe the irgc in its entirety it be clear terrorist operation directly threaten individual across the world include in the uk supply weaponry to the russian force for use in the ukrainian war abolish free speech execute thousand and thousand of innocent civilian each year and inhibit the right of woman in well news free trade deal with india will be tremendous opportunity for both the united kingdom and india it be disappointing that we do not have the trade deal yet since it be initially anticipate for diwali however agree with the prime minister that we should not sacrifice quality in order to do deal quickly the government have assure the house that the majority of the negotiation conversation be conclude by the end of october last year so hope that this deal be still be prioritise to obtain mutually satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible and certainly not in perfunctory manner along with many indian resident in harrow east look forward to trade deal that will be the first of its kind for india the first free trade deal that the country have do hopefully as soon as diwali so we do not have long and certainly before the upcoming indian election host student in my constituency office over two week period for the annual work experience programme the student be real asset to the constituency enthusiastically get involve in range of task from survey resident to volunteer at london community kitchen engage in lively political debate and help with some of the office admin want to say thank you to all the resident who take the time to answer the student survey as their contribution be truly helpful in assist their learning and none of those excellent student could be describe as ragamuffin during this week the student gather over survey and deliver letter to nearly every ward in harrow east learn the importance of data collection that help my casework statistic to reach staggering since be elect mp for harrow east as thank you for all the student hard work we conclude with day in westminster we have tour around parliament and trip to conservative campaign headquarters follow by an interesting talk from member of the team and the party chairman the day conclude with visit to downing street and great photo opportunity continue to run my weekly tour as do many other colleague give resident an opportunity to ask question of and allow to show off this wonderful establishment since be elect have welcome more than resident here and look forward to continue that after the recess another area that be passionate about be smoke cessation four year on from the initial smokefree commitment make at the dispatch box we be not on course to achieve it welcome the recent announcement that disposable vape will be ban because they encourage child to use tobacco product be pleased that the nhs will begin targeted lung cancer screening to help detect cancer soon and speed up diagnosis for those with history of smoking both my parent die of that so it be personal issue for however there be long way to go the khan review last year demonstrate the need for urgent action if we be to get anywhere near the target research by cancer research show that despite significant momentum over the past few year we have recently go backwards on the number of people smoke that be not good enough each day that the government fail to take action be another day when people will be diagnose with smoking relate cancer be pleased to join representative of cancer research uk as they present to the prime minister at downing street petition of more than signature urge the government to provide more funding to help people quit smoking wish all colleague in this house and the other place the staff in our team the security team the catering team and everyone else who play key part in keep everything afloat very restful jolly and fruitful conference recess spend time with family and for those of we who be go at our various party conference and most importantly serve our constituent over that period to those who celebrate last week wish happy rosh hashanah and jai jinendra to those celebrate this week wish happy ganesh chaturthi finally thank the backbench business committee for grant this debate be go to say thank you mr deputy speaker but should now say thank you madam deputy speaker for preside over it thank the hon gentleman for open the debate remind colleague that they should stay for the wind up call siobhain mcdonagh it be now week since my sister margaret die of glioblastoma brain tumour may thank you madam deputy speaker for attend her funeral since her death have make it my mission to make sure that glioblastoma have cure would not wish margaret experience on my bad enemy through care for margaret for month have learn few thing through margaret treatment and campaigning on this issue have meet industry expert trade body ministers charity and scientist it be topic that know far more about than would ever have wish to and the big insight have gain be this the treatment of brain tumour in the nhs have not improve in year when person be diagnose with glioblastoma they get eight week radiotherapy follow by as much chemotherapy with temozolomide as they can manage that drug be introduce in and it be call the gold standard treatment in our nhs can tell you that it be not gold standard it be not even plastic standard it do not cure anyone it extend the life of very few people margaret could take only four to six week of it before her kidney collapse what else be you offer lifetime of pay your taxis work hard do your good and there be no drug trial there be no alternative there be no hope perhaps the unspoken advice be just to go home lie down and wait to die the only hope that do exist be in other country family crowdfund and spend their life saving travel all over the world in my case take very ill margaret on plane to germany every month over the last decade we have see transformation in hope and life expectancy in relation to some cancer but absolutely zero progress for brain tumour member do not need to take my word for it they just need to check the fact at glance the average life expectancy for the people who will be diagnose with glioblastoma in the next year be nine month the five year survival rate be only the sad fact speak for themselves nothing have change nothing have improve and if we keep carry on down the same path nothing will ever improve on friday receive an unsolicited text from cancer research uk which tell that together we be beat cancer and power progress and be to see how far we have come you can imagine the irony with which read that text but it be not the same for all cancer we know that great thing have be do for lung cancer in the five year survival rate be not dissimilar to the survival rate for glioblastoma the difference however be that by the five year survival rate for lung cancer have double to in the five year survival rate for breast cancer be there have be concerted effort by clinician charity the government and family to make sure that people with breast lung and bowel cancer live long as they should the sad truth be that brain cancer have be forget about and because only people be diagnose each year it be not profitable for the pharmaceutical industry to invest in it and find cure promise that this speech will get bit bright say early that the big insight have gain through this process be that the treatment of brain tumour on the nhs have not improve in year the next thing learn be equally important it do not have to be this way there be solution we just need to try something new and here be my something new my four point plan to transform the outcome of people diagnose with glioblastoma first we need target of get glioblastoma patient into clinical trial each year on drug that have the potential to change the course of the disease that would be patient over the lifetime of parliament with those trial we can begin to understand what work and what do not secondly the nhs should repurpose every drug already license to deal with other tumour for clinical trial on brain tumour that have not happen yet because glioblastoma be very small target market for the pharmaceutical industry the government must either encourage or ultimately force the pharmaceutical company to provide the drug for these trial repurpose those drug would be cheap way to make huge difference it be the only way that we can make difference thirdly the nhs should ensure that every neuro oncology multidisciplinary team have medical oncologist who be core member and be require to attend meeting to discuss patient so that brain tumour patient be not leave in corner of the ward because there be no specialist argue for they unless neuro oncologist be in the room we will not benefit from their idea or expertise fourthly the nhs should require that every doctor train to be medical oncologist should go through mandatory course on brain tumour at the moment the royal college of physicians require no compulsory training doctor have to take two course on bowel cancer as part of their training but nothing on brain tumour believe they do not take the brain tumour option the reason why there be nobody on those ward and the research infrastructure be not there be that nobody be be train or be excited to do the job if we can do those four thing we can have some hope have speak to dr paul mulholland the fantastic oncologist at university college hospital and he feel that he could find cure within seven year but it be not go to happen on its own and it be certainly not go to happen if we carry on try the same thing we have be try for the last year einstein famously say the definition of insanity be do the same thing over and over again and expect different result think we be get to that point with the treatment of glioblastoma it be time to break the mould take risk and try something different margaret life require nothing less be sure speak on behalf of the whole house in pass our condolence on to you siobhain and your family your dedication in care for margaret be unsurpassed we all know that and your bravery and energy in the campaigning you have do since at time of such grief be truly inspiring we be all think of you and thank you for make such brave speech hon member hear hear this be the second time that have hear the hon member for mitcham and morden siobhain mcdonagh talk about glioblastoma in debate be exceptionally close to my sister and think would be do exactly the same thing if she be poorly as margaret be at the time of the previous debate margaret be still with we and now she be not and wish to send the hon member all my love from this side of the house have never hear of glioblastoma until we have that debate in westminster hall have be beneficiary of the advancement in the treatment of breast cancer and want she to know that be here if she want cross party support in any campaign for her four point plan will stand with she to make sure that that happen because think it be really important that we work together to support each other on issue such as this many of our constituent will unfortunately face the same situation that margaret face and will not have the voice of relative who stand up and speak so powerfully be with you on this campaign it be pleasure to speak in this debate and pause momentarily to remember our dear colleague david amess who without doubt would have be here to speak today david and share passion for animal welfare and be often at the same briefing event here on the estate it be the ongoing badger cull that wish to speak about today to be honest have often feel very lonely in opposition to the badger cull on the government benches my first speech on the subject stand up for the voiceless badger from the same position that stand in today be meet with some aggressive groan from those sit within touching distance and follow by outrageous briefing against both inside and outside the chamber many of those colleague have now leave and those who remain who differ in their view do so respectfully we have have some much well toned debate on the badger cull since but have not change my view that the cull be wrong if anything feel vindicate that some year since it start there be little proof that it have by itself work the only thing that have change be the population of badger which in some place be sadly now near extinction why when there be many local and national issue that could be stand here speak about be choose to talk about the badger cull today the simple answer be that yet again the goalpost have be move only this time not by those pesky badger but by the government themselves it be report last week that the secretary of state tell national farmers union reception here in westminster that she have scrap any arbitrary deadline for when we stop cull contrary to the exit strategy of the previous secretary of state my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice which would have see an effective end to the cull by it be important to reflect briefly on the history of the cull since first become involve in this debate through the lens of wildlife protection have often hear with great sadness about the immense financial and emotional pain that bovine tuberculosis cause farmer up and down the country the devastation for farmer when skin test come back positive virtually condemn their herd of cattle be utterly heartbreaking the groan at my speech aside the testimony of colleague from rural south west constituency in particular on behalf of their farming community have be hard for they to articulate and for other to hear however it have show that the fight be as much about ensure that farmer be support by the government in implement the wide array of countermeasure to prevent tb as it be about protect badger which be an iconic specie in the uk with the support of the department for environment food and rural affairs lead by my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth we have see investment in cattle vaccination funding of gamma testing vastly improve farm management practice and additional biosecurity measure all of that have contribute significantly to the reduction of bovine tb there be little evidence that the cull have do the same the secretary of state say last week that she would be lead by science which be also what the government say in when they first announce their intention to introduce badger culling however when the science be say that badger culling have have no significant impact it seem wrong to scrap the strategy that would have end intensive culling my primary mission over the year have be to stand up for much love and legally protect specie what we know now after year of this cruel cull be that the vast majority of bovine tb in cattle come as result of cow to cow infection it be spread within intensive farming production system spill over into the wide environment and continue to infect animal whether wild farmed or domestic thoughtful and consider improvement discuss by defra official have help to manage improve and control the spread of disease and some farm support by animal welfare campaign such as the save me trust the badger trust and bear free have btb free farm without the need for cull the sad thing be that many badger who be cull be actually free of tb one statistic that recall seeing be that of the badger cull between and be subject to post mortem and test for bovine tb of that number less than be find to have bovine tb to degree where they pose risk of infect other badger or possibly cattle furthermore the method of cull innocent disease free animal cause great pain badger be sentient and the inhumane cull method use cause they fear and pain over three quarter of the badger cull in be cull by free shooting where cull contractor shoot badger at night from distance with high power rifle that method of badger killing have increase year on year and have rise to be the primary method it use to be that half of badger cull be subject to death by free shooting but now that figure be over the independent expert panel form by the government to monitor the efficacy and humaneness of the badger cull during its first two year find that free shooting be inhumane due to the length of time badger could take to die the iep report that in the first year of the cull between and of badger shot take over five minute to die of bullet wound blood loss and organ failure that panel make number of key recommendation to improve the humaneness of cull operation but it be disband in prevent any further independent oversight of the cull policy the british veterinary association have since withdraw its support for that method in my view the cull remain cruel inhumane and unnecessary in the fight to eradicate bovine tb badger be the scapegoat the victim of politic rather than science the way to solve bovine tb in cattle have always be to focus on cattle base measure include investment in cattle vaccination proper testing and continuous improvement in farming method of course that require government funding but if we be not spend ten of million of pound each year on cull that money could have make real difference elsewhere believe that defra be look to do so through the policy announce in by my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth my constituent care passionately about animal welfare issue and while my heart break for the farmer condemn to lose their herd due to bovine tb have always be of the view that the inhumane and intensive culling of badger be not the answer it be never suppose to be forever and my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey the current secretary of state say that she will be lead by science agree let we be lead by the science and end this indiscriminate badger genocide may thank the hon lady for her kind word to my friend the hon member for mitcham and morden siobhain mcdonagh and for what she say about her wonderful sister believe that the hon lady herself be rather doughty campaigner on breast cancer have climb mount kilimanjaro and raise so congratulation to she and her team on do that climb mount kilimanjaro lot of year ago have to say but there we be congratulate my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden siobhain mcdonagh because it must have be very painful to bring what she tell we before the house and think that everybody who be listen will stand as one with she those of we who know margaret know that she do not deserve to experience what she do and we remember she with affection we be also committed to help my hon friend with her campaign may begin by speak about the international seabed authority and deep sea mining that might be slightly odd topic for this afternoon but it be nevertheless important and dramatically in need of bring before the house and the world authority as we know there be those who would seek to exploit the world seabed for commercial reason the purported logic be that we need to find the rare metal we use in our battery mobile phone electric vehicle and so on however there be increase concern in the scientific community that exploitation of the global seabed be great risk first we know little about the seabed and we do not know how much carbon be sequester there we also know little about the impact that the toxic waste produce would have on life in the ocean and on life we as yet do not understand some scientist have write to our prime minister ask that he be part of global coalition for moratorium on exploitation of the seabed and hope that he and those on the government front bench will listen seriously to those view those scientist say in very straightforward term that the consequence of exploit the seabed would be potentially severe and irreversible impact on the marine environment its biodiversity and its ecosystem give the lack of science available at the moment we simply can not take the risk and it be right that we have moratorium in the short run not permanent ban although that may well be where we should head say that because little be decide at the international seabed authority conference in july except to defer decision about potential exploitation until next year that mean that our government now have time to join france sweden brazil chile costa rica and host of other country in make sure that the science be there before we even contemplate this destruction which we will not be able to reverse if we allow it that bring to something else want to raise in this pre conference debate the lack of global progress on climate change the recent united nations report indicate how far behind the world be on progress towards do what we need to do to stop the catastrophic temperature rise we be already experience as we know we have to do more in this country do not want to make this into bipartisan political debate and although the uk may not have do enough it have make considerable effort on climate change but we must also be part of the global coalition that recognise that this issue can not be solve in just one country hear an environment minister boast this morning that we be in the lead but it be not good enough to be in the lead we need to be in the pack make sure that the whole world be safe and that mean transfer the technology and resource to the develop world which simply be not be do today the third little hobby horse would be grateful to get off my chest be be not able to be here yesterday for the urgent question on but let just say that have long be promise to the north of england and the city of manchester it would liberate enormous economic potential in manchester but as importantly perhaps more importantly we know that the capacity of the west coast main line be very near full now it will not be long before we simply can not ship our manufacture good from the north of england to the south and on through into europe this be not some slight argument about the pride of the north although be proud northerner it be not even about whether we can shave few minute off the journey time between manchester and london it be about whether our manufacturer be in position to take advantage of the railway system and whether environmentally we be shift those heavy good vehicle off our motorway and road and make sure that our rail system have the capacity to carry those thing that be no small issue and it should not be resolve by prime minister and chancellor huddle together and government who be not prepared to come before the chamber yesterday to give any definitive answer as you will know as northern mp madam deputy speaker it would be see as colossal betrayal of the north if we be to see abandon by the way that sentiment be express by government back benchers as well as by opposition members whether the line be up to scotland or to different part of the north there be the feeling that if the government abandon the north in this way it would say nothing at all for the future of the levelling up agenda will finish on slightly happy issue be not able to be here when tribute be be pay to the outgoing clerk of the house john benger join those tribute because think john benger have be not only an excellent clerk of the house but an excellent servant of the house over the many year that you madam deputy speaker and have know he be delighted that he occupy that place he have do this house credit and he will do great credit in his new role and look forward to he as good supporter of manchester united now be able to play significant role in the fortune of our club which be perhaps not as good as the fortune of the house of commons will raise three matter in my brief remark this afternoon public transport specifically in relation to school antisocial behaviour and the rebuilding of ukraine post victory in order to ensure that pupil and student do well in school clearly and obviously we must first ensure that they can get to school safely and on time have be contact over the summer by many concerned parent about some local bus service be cut which make it difficult to get their child to school on time or in some case at all the west of england combined authority have receive million for bus service improvement plan but it have decide that the and the bus service will be serve by the same vehicle that lead to some child who attend winterbourne academy in particular arrive either absurdly early or very late while some service have be cut back other crucial bus service have be ax entirely such as the from fishponds via downend and the from patchway bradley stoke and little stoke my constituent and would like to know where the million to enable bus service to improve have go unfortunately while essential bus service for child be be cut the vanity scheme of the west of england mayor be be roll out the birthday bus pass scheme which provide taxpayer subsidise bus travel for passenger travel throughout the month of their birthday it be clear to that the mayor of the west of england and south gloucestershire council be not sufficiently prioritise support child bus service implore the west of england mayor to stop waste taxpayer money and to answer my call to work with south gloucestershire council to deliver enough transport provision so that our child can get to school and back the bus service that take our child to school be an important factor in reinforce the fabric of our community reduce pollution and reduce commute traffic in addition to maintain parent peace of mind have be work closely with my excellent colleague councillor liz brennan on this issue and look forward to meet the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for north west durham mr holden to discuss local bus provision in recent month we have see an increase in antisocial behaviour in patchway and stoke gifford in my constituency we have see the vandalising of child playground and the reckless driving of car and scooter which have lead to several accident some of they be serious not to mention the burning down of playground in stoke gifford park by arsonist what be more local in patchway have fall victim to be terrorise by thug in balaclavas smash car window and cause great distress to resident have meet the police and crime commissioner mark shelford to discuss the rise in antisocial behaviour and what avon and somerset police will do about it in addition my colleague councillor gupta have raise the issue locally echo his concern to the government while some may choose to dismiss that as low level crime it must be deal with swiftly and robustly so as not to create the space or environment in which the same criminal could commit even bad offence recently go on my third visit to ukraine so far this year attend the yalta european strategy conference at which we discuss the power of ukraine ideal how help ukraine in its hour of need be good for global economic and political stability and security and how we may bring this illegal and terrible war to an end crucially would like to offer the house some idea and solution on how ukraine may rebuild after russian force be expel from ukrainian sovereign territory the new lines institute for strategy and policy have propose system of multilateral asset transfer as way of provide reparation to ukraine and international partner who have help in the struggle that would involve the united kingdom and our ally identify and transfer all russian state asset within our jurisdiction to central bank account or to be hold in trust with russian asset securely hold in trust allocation procedure would be introduce in line with transparent multilateral agreement another useful proposal be for tax incentive for company invest in the uk and ukraine mean that more job and investment would come to the uk that would help with some degree of infrastructure rebuilding in ukraine some of that could well be fund by the private sector third proposal be for ukraine to receive some funding from the overseas development budget of ally nation we must endeavour to build powerful bilateral relation between our two country include our institution of trade and cultural exchange defence manufacturing and logistic firm and the industry of other sector strong bilateral relationship base on defence security and trade with long term vision can help to keep ukraine safe sovereign and secure madam deputy speaker associate myself with your word about margaret mcdonagh and my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden siobhain mcdonagh let my hon friend know that we be all here for she at any time of the day whenever she need we it be good to see my hon friend the member for rochdale tony lloyd back in his place like the hon member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch want to channel sir david amess he would always start his speech by go around his constituency and hope to do that too welcome the treasurer of his majesty household the right hon member for nuneaton mr jones to his place we be grace with his presence and the new deputy shadow leader of the house my hon friend the member for blaenau gwent nick smith think they will find that this be one of the nice debate they will have ever respond to start with bescot stadium station which have footbridge link one platform with the other however those with disability can not access the platform so walsall disabled supporter have to take the train into the town centre and come back just to get to the football ground meet with the minister of state at the department for transport the hon member for bexhill and battle huw merriman who be helpful he make the point that there have never be an application for access for all funding find that disconcert because these people be the most vulnerable in society and need access to the station hope to have meeting with network rail but could the whip kindly find out whether there be any obligation under equality legislation that would enable we to appropriate those fund immediately rather than have to wait for the next round of access for all funding we would like to do it soon rather than later even parent with pram find it difficult to access the station walsall station will keep its ticket office but sadly bescot will lose its one in the westminster hall debate the minister admit the change be about modernise the passenger experience by move expert ticketing staff out of ticket office to be more visible and accessible around the station official report september vol the logic be not quite there be not clear why expert ticketing staff be move away from their job could the government please look again the second issue want to raise be not about reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete but about the condition of my school in walsall south joseph leckie academy be allocate million under building schools for the future but that be cancel the then secretary of state mention that he make mistake by cancel building schools for the future that school have have to bid every time for fund give the issue go on with raac the asbestos in the school and the condition improvement fund wonder whether the whip could ask the education secretary to ensure that school be give the fund allocate immediately so that they can deal with the problem blue coat academy have to apply to the condition improvement fund just to fix the roof it seem sensible that rather than have to bid every year and waste money on surveyor fee and other cost they just have the fund already allocate to they they be bid against each other which be an appalling situation for school to be in my third issue be about bus like the hon member for filton and bradley stoke jack lopresti forgot to say that it be pleasure to follow he we too have vanity project call the sprint bus phase of the west midland mayor do not know what it be about mayors and why they need to have vanity project the sprint bus have be withdraw from major city because it be not safe but the mayor seem to want to proceed in fact local authority try to cut down tree but the community fight back and that be stop now the west midlands combined authority and the west midland transport authority want to widen the bus lane my constituent zena owen have work out that it will shave off just one minute from the travel time we have the excellent and bus route which go from walsall to birmingham in minute my constituent be really happy with that can not see the logic of phase it will waste money it will not cut time and passenger be happy with the current service in fact we be not even sure whether the and the service would continue could the whip please raise this issue with the mayor to tell he that we would like that vanity project to be stop my fourth point be about government policy on foreign national offender foreign national offender be convict of attempt murder of one of my constituent have raise this issue many time with ministers and have be tell that he can not be deport because he be engage his article right to prevent torture and inhuman or degrading treatment the foreign national offender can engage his article right but my constituent can not engage her article right to life the balance have be skew in favour of the foreign national offender want to know exactly what government policy be be it for the offender or for the victim understand that this foreign national offender will not be deport to the first country because there be an issue but the minister do have the discretion to look for another country that he could go to my constituent live in fear yes she have be tell roughly where he be but he could be anywhere she be public servant try to help he when she be stab in the neck she nearly die do not think it be appropriate that she should continue to live under that fear sadly be come on to another very difficult issue meet my constituent year old sami who be savage by pit bull terrier he go out with his football to play in his front garden and the pit bull terrier which live two door down come out and stick its tooth into his arm and would not let go sami be lucky to be alive if it have be his baby brother who be small than the dog do not think he would have survive sami mother and friend come out but they could not get the dog off he sami have to wait hour in walsall manor hospital to get any treatment his mother say he can not sleep at night it be really difficult sami be extremely extremely brave want to add my voice and ask the minister to raise with the home secretary consider ban dog that be breed to attack and dog that have attack human whether child or adult it be not sufficient just to muzzle the dog because attack can take place in the home these dog be incredibly frightening so that be my ask sami be make recovery he go to reedswood academy know he would be very pleased if the whole house join in wish he speedy recovery finally want to mention two public servant glen barnham colleague of mine have sadly die he be councillor and we serve on ealing council together he be remarkable politician he be first elect in and retire in he be chair of social service when be vice chair and the budget be always protect glen have an amazing way with his constituent when go round to anybody

say thank you all very much want to focus on three local concern first there be some good news warmly welcome yesterday announcement of million for new community diagnostic centre at congleton war memorial hospital the security of the hospital future have always be priority for as the local member of parliament not least because know how much it mean to my constituent congleton war memorial hospital be fund by local subscription many people agree to deduction from their pay packet to help with the building of the hospital but its future have not always look secure which be why not only but my predecessor mps have consistently campaign to keep it open and indeed secure its future be delighted that that consistent campaigning have be successful it be in may this year that on the most recent occasion ask the health secretary in the house for the expansion and modernisation of facility be delighted that million of national funding have be provide to ensure that healthcare provision in congleton will remain and that work be plan to start soon and be finish very quickly by autumn next year there be to be new one stop shop offer nhs diagnostic test scan and check close to home east cheshire nhs trust have be award the million by nhs england to re engineer and expand the exist facility own by the trust on the congleton war memorial hospital site the new centre will provide

respiratory physiological testing such as electrocardiography echo cardiogram and other physiological test they will also include some test and study that can be take away and perform from patient home further testing from the site will be develop over time this really be welcome news for the congleton resident who fear for many year that their local hospital be in jeopardy and pay tribute to all the resident who have campaign and raise fund to support the hospital let now turn to less happy local issue which rear its head periodically over the year and which first come to my attention even before be elect in as member of parliament for congleton refer to the threat of the imposition of car parking charge in the town of alsager middlewich sandbach and holmes chapel the argument be put forward by cheshire east council be base on rationalisation but one size do not fit all it be true that there be some place in cheshire east where charge already apply but large town such as macclesfield crewe and even nantwich be completely different from small community such as holmes chapel which be actually village and strongly support resident objection to these proposal we have fight this off before and we can fight it off again therefore urge resident to lodge objection on the consultation section of the cheshire east website which open tomorrow september and close on november as alsager town council have say the negative impact on the economy of impose these charge would far outweigh the revenue anticipate from they small independent shop and cafés would be particularly vulnerable to reduction in people come into these centre and as we know many small business live on the margin the significant loss of community spirit that could ensue have also be highlight by alsager town council so urge all resident concern about this issue to contribute to the consultation to make their voice know and to object shall turn now to happy local issue and take this opportunity to pay tribute to number of resident who have be grant the freedom of their town this month just two day ago at the annual civic service in middlewich hold at st michael and all angels church three resident be grant the freedom of middlewich be not sure whether any of they have any sheep that they can drive down the high street but want to pay tribute to all of they whom know well they be janet chisholm bem who found the middlewich clean team ken kingston who have do so much work with the british legion and david cooke who have help to run the boys brigade in middlewich for many year know at first hand the substantial contribution that all three have make to local community life and by grant they the freedom of middlewich the mayor of middlewich councillor colin coules have recognise their contribution in way that they all very much deserve would also like to pay tribute to ronald tyson who be well know to all of we locally as ron tyson early this month at st mary alsager he be grant the freedom of the town of alsager for service to the community he serve for year on alsager town council and the alsager institute collectively he serve as chairman of the

local community with many strongly committed resident such as those have speak of today will very much miss represent middlewich if be re elect at the next general election madam deputy speaker would like to begin by say how much admire the way in which you so sensitively and generously respond to my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden siobhain mcdonagh when she speak about her campaign on glioblastoma in memory of her sister you really do speak for the whole house and it be greatly appreciate the pleasure of participate in such debate be in the range of topic cover and agree with many of the subject that have be choose the hon member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch speak very well about the badger cull and the importance of science and my hon friend the member for rochdale tony lloyd speak very well about the importance of science in deep sea mining sometimes we need to fact check our speech and take the opportunity to fact check the complaint make by the hon member for harrow east bob blackman about the mayor of london give himself an exemption on his car be reliably inform by the mayor office that this be not the case and that the mayor own car do not have an exemption as we think of sir david who be such part of this particular debate we need to temper our criticism so that people who be as high in public life as the mayor be not unduly target thank my hon friend for correct the record it be so important that parliament above all have correct information we can not let misinformation flourish give how social media go round and round very quickly which can be detrimental to the public discourse challenge the house to fill in the missing word as safe member houses member have say it but for too many people that saying have become rather sick joke today want to share the story of my constituent for whom their house their home have be anything but safe damask court block of flat in my brent north constituency be complete in be first approach by resident in march and they report that their building be sway the floor be move and in high wind the whole building shake be tell that the roof be leak so badly that water pour through the electrical socket and the window have drop by cm in two month as the house could imagine immediately visit the property and take photograph of water stream through the light fitting and dripping on to child bed the same day write to the chief executive and the chair of the board of apna ghar housing association which own the block also write to steve wood the chief executive of the national house building council which have provide the warranty for the development six week later on may nhbc reply state that these structural issue have be report by tenant to the builder parritt bellamy within its two year liability period but that parritt bellamy have go into administration and the original development company asra housing have simply sell up and walk away the nhbc visit the property to assess the structural issue under part of its buildmark warranty and this be where the problem should have stop they do not they be only just begin at the end of november discover that essential support for the core of the building be miss the floor be overstress cause the sway movement when resident walk across they the roof have be incorrectly fit cause the leak the floor throughout the flat be bow and the balcony floor be defective apna ghar the new owner of the development advise resident in december that it have submit claim to the nhbc it also advise that its chief executive be leave the housing association with immediate effect as the problem unfold this become repeat pattern everyone simply walk away except for the tenant of course they be trap trap in an unsafe building in ask the nhbc to clarify when the investigation work would be complete request copy of the full report when it become available and ask for date when the remediation would commence do not receive copy of the report but at the end of july the nhbc say the investigation be complete and that it have offer apna ghar two option to settle the claim at that point apna ghar go incommunicado so in october arrange to meet two representative from the nhbc they be apologetic they fully understand the serious concern raise by resident and they be anxious to do everything possible to resolve the matter they promise to revert to and provide full update feel reassure but be mistaken as never do receive their full report during the general election period in december another tenant contact and she be extremely distressed her letter say that the building be constantly shake my home flood whenever it rain and be unable to sleep for fear of the building fall down and my three child go to bed fully clothe with our shoe on in case we need to leave the building quickly be so concerned that immediately visit her home and it be truly shocking demand meeting with the new chief executive of apna ghar and show he the photographic and video evidence of what have witness and then the country go into complete lockdown continue to write to apna ghar throughout and but receive no response the reason be eventually give be that after our meeting the chief executive have resign and not be replace another person have simply walk away learn from another resident that apna ghar have write to they claim that it be in regular contact with nhbc and that there be no reported structural issue within the building that be lie again demand that apna ghar should provide with copy of the independent report but again there be total failure to respond it would not even provide copy of the first and second stage complaint which would have allow to refer the matter to the ombudsman in march of last year another resident in the block advise that because of the leak and the water damage which have not be repair for seven month her three child be all sleep in one room all these family have be fail at the high level there have be total disregard from apna ghar of its legal obligation under section of the landlord and tenant act and under the environmental protection act and of the duty set out in section of the defective premises act in january of this year when one of my constituent lodge formal complaint she receive response from solicitor employ by apna ghar who acknowledge that she have indeed report that her bathroom floor be damage in december and admit that this have not be fix by september however they claim that because the member of staff who receive the original message no long work there they could not help the same legal team have claim that it be not apna ghar fault because their client acquire the block from another register provider of social housing what my constituent want to know be when apna ghar acquire damask court be it aware of the structural problem that have already be report to the builder and the developer what due diligence be undertake before take ownership of the block do it purchase damask court at discount price because of the problem the same solicitor have now also advise that there be ongoing discussion with the national house building council nhbc regard the defect affect the block that be strange give that have already be tell back in that the nhbc have make an offer to the housing association to pay for the remediation of the whole building four year on the solicitor be apparently instruct that the nhbc claim will need to be resolve that remedy the defect be go to require significant programme of work but that all complaint to date have be handle within reasonable period of time that be nonsense the fact be that nobody not the quantity surveyor the project manager the building control officer the builder or the developer and not the nhbc should ever have sign off that building as fit to live in it never be parritt bellamy the builder walk away asra housing group the developer walk away two chief executive of apna ghar walk away and yesterday receive from resident copy of notice from the act chief executive of apna ghar housing association advise the resident of damask court that your

merchant charter of create closed shop in which only newcastle people could sell certain good and service in newcastle we on the conservative benches be not much in favour of closed shop but give that

still in evidence today for much of the next few hundred year we be the most important town in north staffordshire predate stoke on trent those upstart to our east by some century our location on the

the landscape of newcastle culturally economically and physically with the plentiful reserve of coal and iron in the mine our burgeon industry have the fuel they need to power their mill although mining have take place in newcastle since the roman time it be the industrialisation of mining that lead to the significant growth of the borough refer to that in my maiden speech so will not repeat it today none the less our coal be among the fine in the kingdom which be why stoke on trent and its kiln be where they be that industrial and mining heritage in north staffordshire be proudly remember the last pit to close be silverdale in always know that the work that the miner undertake be hard and dangerous and we do suffer more than most with major disaster at diglake in minnie pit in and holditch in there be frequent memorial where we remember the name of those people who lose their life in those tragedy that be real part of our cultural and emotional heritage in newcastle under lyme notably there be an attempt in this house in to extend stoke on trent by amalgamate it with newcastle under lyme and wolstanton completely against the wish of the people of newcastle this house pass that measure but happily we be save by the lords postcard poll take at the time show that resident oppose that bill by majority of which be pretty good outcome be glad that the lords save we from be swallow up by the people of stoke on trent because otherwise we would not be have these anniversary celebration today traditional industry have decline and that be story that many of we in this house share know that you know about that in doncaster madam deputy speaker but new industry be take their place we have see huge growth in the service sector and in high tech industry in my area of particular note be the spectacular success of the science park at keele where some of the first covid vaccine be manufacture in we start single innovation centre which now have multiple building include management centre keele university have become leader in green energy house smart energy network demonstrator wind turbine and solar farm all contribute to the way in which university and other public building will be able to power themselves in future we still have number of very good engineering firm on our business park particularly in metalwork sadly though the past two decade have see significant decline in town centre across the country and newcastle be no exception that have be something big than politic it be about shopping habit it be about the internet first it be about people shop in supermarket but increasingly it have become about people shop on amazon the stalwart of the high street of the past woolworths debenhams and british homes stores be all go this government be do something about that through the future high street fund and the town deal the borough be due to benefit from more than million of investment from those fund in the come year that work be happen right now we have million to regenerate the town centre million through the future high street fund have already be use to demolish the old civic office which be riddle with asbestos that area will be rebuild soon with residential and commercial premise on the ryecroft which have be leave empty for too long and we will bolster the town shopping and leisure facility with new more modern and more welcoming market some of that investment be already visible an employment training and skill hub have open in lancaster buildings and the subway to get under the ring road which unfortunately do circumscribe the town centre bit have be give spruce up with some fantastic artwork we will also see some major construction project particularly the redevelopment of york place come

because of the enormous and beautiful statue of queen victoria there just opposite my constituency office and in front of the council office we will now have two queen victoria and elizabeth side by side and look forward to the unveiling finally be conscious that have speak for while in go over the history we be still blight by walleys quarry which have mention many time in this house include in previous debate before adjournment the smell be quite lot well though it do still smell on occasion but we now really need to see accountability only last week there be yet another category breach report against the operator of walleys quarry ltd whose parent company be red industries environment agency guidance suggest that prosecution should follow can not pre empt the environment agency investigation but know everyone in newcastle want to see it draw both its regulatory and criminal investigation to conclusion and achieve proper accountability for what people have be through as have tell this house many time the situation have be completely unacceptable and we really need to see some accountability overall remain committed to ensure that the future of our town which be so proud to represent be bright and prosperous will continue to work with the council especially the council leader simon tagg in any way can to bring more investment into newcastle in the year ahead to enable the improvement that we all want to see be pleased to follow my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme aaron bell be glad to hear how progressive historic and industrial his area be and about his work to stop that stink it be huge pleasure to represent the wonderful constituency of dover and deal which have similar mining heritage to the one my hon friend outline however like any community it be not without some challenge so before the come adjournment want to touch on the area of work that have be undertake to bring service improvement and investment to deal walmer and the village an area that make up around half of my constituency with some people first there be the water and sewerage system part of deal have an old style bazalgette system to deal with its water and sewage which have contribute to decade long flooding particularly around the albert road area of deal jointly lead the deal water action taskforce have put that taskforce together with southern water to try to come up with some technical sensible practical solution to the problem we be work to put the situation right with more than worth of flood reduction investment already make in the town and further engineering and nature base investment in our local water and sewerage system to come not only will that investment help with the decade long flooding in albert road but it will make our community an early adopter of the conservative commitment to end sea sewage discharge there be parliamentary showcase upcoming and hope some hon member might be interested in come to learn more about the cutting edge work that we have be do in that vital area perhaps one of the ministers from the department for environment food and rural affairs might attend too secondly come on to law and order while ours be generally an area without the level of crime and disorder see elsewhere which be describe early in this debate there have be specific issue of antisocial behaviour with dangerous motorbiking in nonington and car race around betteshanger while deal have see some frankly unpleasant youth activity in victoria park and the cemetery fly tipping have be on the increase too follow my representation to our conservative police and crime commissioner matthew scott be pleased to confirm that he be implement new community police response support by the extra funding and resource provide by the conservative government the response will see front counter police presence in deal open to local resident be press matthew scott for the recruitment and opening of that initiative to be accelerate it will be significant new one stop shop for local people in the town there will also be new dedicated antisocial behaviour taskforce and boost to very important rural village police many villager often feel overlook by local policing and the police and crime commissioner be work hard to address that the new measure will mean that deal walmer and our local village will benefit from specific police support to tackle important local policing and community issue well healthcare be key issue that be work on for dover and deal as whole later today will present community petition about the closure of phlebotomy service at deal hospital and the move to gp only blood testing service which have not work and be let our community down over the last two year we have have hard fought community campaign to reinstate these vital service with petition candlelight vigil and community consultation that attract the interest of more than resident across deal walmer sholden kingsdown ripple and great mongeham the consultation which lead work with the deal blood action taskforce group find that resident be have to travel four or more hour for blood test and at great cost some resident pay more than to travel to get local blood test say local blood test because the commission condition from local health chief be that after the move from deal hospital to gps every resident would have access to local blood test but that be not happen specific group of people have be particularly affect by the decision to close phlebotomy service at deal hospital include resident with diabetes cancer and long term health condition old resident with mobility or financial challenge and child for whom no provision be make follow the closure and who be miss school and their parent miss work to get their blood test do outside the area blood test be not just nice to have they be fundamental and basic part of our health system not have timely access to local blood service can prevent early diagnosis and intervention and result in patient remain on the wrong medicine harm their health outcome such blood service be important so be pleased to report that the kent and medway integrate care board have now agree that the need of the priority group identify by the deal blood action team must be address the icb say that it will procure blood service again shortly with view to restart they in welcome the long overdue and slow recognition of the immense harm that that decision of nearly two year ago have cause local resident give the seriousness of the issue it be obviously most sensible to reinstate the service at deal hospital without delay that be what my petition will set out from police flooding and pothole to restore high speed rail and protect the important marine habitat of the goodwin sands it be great pleasure to represent deal walmer and our local village be pleased to have update the house on the work to secure improvement for and investment in our lovely corner of east kent it be pleasure to speak in this adjournment debate this government be in part elect on promise to level up to ensure that my constituent in blackpool receive exactly the same life chance as people in every single part of our united kingdom my local authority be statistically the most in need of level up indeed probably represent the most deprived constituency in england and be delighted to say that thank to the unprecedented commitment and support from this government our levelling up progress be go from strength to strength an additional revenue and capital investment of million have fly into blackpool south as consequence of the faith and confidence from this government in the work go on locally it be easy to speak about level up and sometimes political figure from different party will want to see evidence of what be actually happen spade in the ground to address some of the systemic challenge in blackpool and many other leave behind town level up be not four year or five year project it be an intergenerational challenge that will take commitment from both main political party over decade and decade if indeed it be to bear any substantial fruit thankfully the investment we have receive be lead to spade in the ground in blackpool and we be now reap the reward of the confidence the government have show in we could be here until midnight discuss all the different funding pot this government have provide to blackpool south but will take just few moment to give the house flavour of some of the positive initiative take place in my constituency the large town deal in the country with million come into blackpool to deliver plethora of project new sport village at revoe in conjunction with blackpool football club an upgrade to the world famous illuminations help to create thousand of job at the blackpool enterprise zone and new start up hub in the town centre move on there be million for brand new multiversity skill complex from the levelling up fund which will not only change immeasurably very deprived part of blackpool but will lead to breaking down of some of the educational challenge and put stop to the brain drain when our youngster leave key stage there be million from the levelling up budget to convert derelict hotel in the town centre and million from the future high street fund to fund development to the houndshill shopping centre and the abingdon street market both of which be well under way there be an additional million to relocate the court complex allow the large single private sector development project in lancashire to go ahead over the next few year there be also million worth of capital investment come into blackpool to create million of pound of additional consumer spend every single year and thousand of extra job that be all thank to this government commitment to level up blackpool but we will not stop there because the list be endless million extra in education funding because we be an opportunity area help to close the gap that have emerge as consequence of the covid pandemic million new upgrade to our mean the front door of have be completely rejuvenate lead to short waiting time in and help patient move throughout their journey in the hospital million in write off the historical debt to blackpool teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust mean more money can now be free up for the frontline to spend on patient rather than in debt receipt million for new electric bus million from the bus and light rail fun million for project adder to help remove off the street of blackpool some of the drug gang that cause misery to my constituent and in only the last few week we receive multimillion pound funding settlement to help youth offend initiative in blackpool lead by the exemplary dave blacker and the blackpool boy and girl club brilliant initiative that will change the life of people in one of the country most deprive ward in addition to that have nearly finish we have million in flood defence work go on in blackpool which will secure the front of the world famous blackpool seafront over million help to address rough sleeping and homelessness and million from the culture recovery fund be spend by variety of project include the fantastic blackpool theatre group all in all there be million of investment come into blackpool it be easy to reel off list of the different investment come into particular area but can honestly say have see at first hand the change this money be make that it be turn people live around it be help to address the educational challenge and give people who have be out of the job market for year new foothold and commitment to our society to find job and to contribute it be address some of the systemic health inequality that have plague blackpool for decade which mean that in part of my constituency life expectancy be year low than in the most affluent part of our country something that successive government red and blue have tolerate for year but that thank to the commitment from this government we be finally serious about address those be some of the brilliant initiative go on in blackpool but as ever blackpool be blackpool we always want more hope that those on the treasury bench be listen to my final few request for funding in blackpool during this parliament and the difference it will make to our local economy and the life of my constituent the first of those be housing lead regeneration in the bond street waterloo road and revoe area of my constituency which be among the most deprive neighbourhood in the country my right hon friend the member for surrey heath michael gove have be fantastic in his commitment to blackpool and indeed level up more generally over the past few year the million package that he be work on in conjunction with blackpool council will help to change those area forever give they new lease of life and address some of the systemic challenge that resident in those community have face for year hope that work will continue and that we will get commitment from the department for levelling up housing and communities to that funding which be badly require my second request be for commitment to blackpool airport own and run by the labour run council it use to operate successful commercial passenger flight throughout europe but that be no long the case due to lack of interest from the council the government have bring in several change that have revolutionise the landscape of domestic aviation and regional airport not least the cut to air passenger duty but further work be require around public service obligation to ensure that we can maximise the economic potential and job create growth of place such as blackpool airport my final request be on more of national issue but it be worthy of mention consider that not day go by when do not receive several email from constituent about the lack of nhs dentistry have unfortunately speak to some constituent who have tell harrowing story about have to take plier to their child tooth because they can not afford private dentist and there be no long any nhs dental practice in blackpool that be open to new patient it be quite shocking story consider we be in the century the government recent change to the nhs dental contract be welcome but there be far more work to do to address the issue of nhs dentistry particularly in so call dental desert such as blackpool where few dental practitioner want to work the house have indulge for far too long madam deputy speaker may take this opportunity to wish you and member an enjoyable recess be the very proud mp for bury north but be bear and bring up in huddersfield before get into politic two thing strike as the first political question they might not seem to be political question but when we think about it they be one be bradley mills cricket club which be found in in an industrial disadvantaged part of huddersfield it go through two world war the great depression the boer war and everything the world could throw at it over year the local community see it as focal point and an identity it be who they be what they be and what they be about it be place where family go and people meet and it be central to that community in the late the local community give up on it and huge green area field that have be use by child family and people play competitive sport be lose forever could never understand why the community keep that club and what it represent to they go for that whole period of time but in the something happen and it fall apart like many of we spend my youth follow my dad around he play amateur football and the good team in huddersfield be call brackenhall they play football on leeds road playing field not very far away from bradley mills cricket club that team be base in an area of disadvantage but they be team full of local people proud symbol of what brackenhall be about that mean something to people look back at the old photo we can not quantify that now but it mean something in the that be lose why do this matter it go back to what my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme aaron bell be talk about unless we have civic pride unless we have some feeling for the area we be from our area be go to fail we be not simply individual link only by how close we live to each other or who we come into contact with we have to have share collective experience and there must be symbol of those share collective experience that link we and bind we could read out very long list of what have come into bury during my time as member of parliament but just want to make the point that through the effort of the secretary of state for levelling up bury football club be resurrect at gigg lane that be the old sporting stadium in the world but it have be leave abandon by bad management bad regulation and the league and be at real risk of be sell to developer by provide million this government save that stadium and it be now facility that be run by the fan for the people of bury and the local community will use those three example to touch on what we should be talk about in this place we in this place be incredibly bad at talk in any term other than monetary one we talk in monetary term about everything all the time clearly that be incredibly important but we do not often hear speech like that of my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme celebrate and lionise their community and say there be something else within this community that you can be proud of how do politician take advantage of that some people attend the first match at people in one place there be no other facility in the metropolitan borough of bury where people can come together in one place as politician we can say that just the way it be that football it nice pastime or we can say as this government do let work in partnership let take those thing that matter to people and look to invest in that stadium and that community gigg lane proudly sit in an area with wide variety of people from different background how do we ensure that those people have access to the good facility service option and advice that they can get we put they in the football stadium we do not put they in town centre or long way away we bring facility and service in partnership to where people want to be and where they be receptive in life we all need little bit of hope and inspiration when we get out of bed when bury football club disappear from my town little bit of hope disappear in lot of people with that club come back there be hope and certain inspiration to want to play for town that be important what brackenhall and bradley mills lose when they lose their community be very important because nothing replace it at this moment in time we be create society of individual who be link by money and talk to each other on social medium we no long interact as local community politic start when you walk out of your front door when you open that door and you nearly trip over that pavement that need to be fix you see the pothole on the road that need to be sort out you see the lamppost where the light be not work and the bus that be probably go to be late all those thing matter to people and if you see those thing around you do that mean that your community be proud community one that be work at its good for each other no it do not we need the symbol of civic pride madam deputy speaker you be from the great city of doncaster we be from nearly the same part of the world the north of england these be the great industrial centre of the north of england when say to people that be bear in huddersfield they often say you not bear in bury how can you understand what it like to be from bury of course you can people in these industrial centre of the north be all link by the same thing in their heart the same passion for where they be from in the first world war we see the accrington pals and other like they go to war together but we do not do thing as community any more and we never talk about community in this place would like to see an understanding of how investment in community which my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme talk about and investment in facility and symbol of civic pride can impact the political process and would like to see that push up the political agenda be proud for many reason to be an mp in this government but level up be political idea of genius because it give money to local people to invest in facility and service that can benefit they if service do not link people in to want to see their area improve it be all complete waste of time but the government have fund numerous project that have give sense of identity pride and passion back to the community we live in which be ignore in the north of england for the to year before that we should invest more in sport invest more in public health and invest more in our culture and then we will have well political system it be pleasure to speak in this debate before the forthcoming adjournment it be also pleasure to follow the absolutely outstanding speech by my hon friend the member for bury north james daly pay tribute to the member for mitcham and morden for her really heartfelt speech it be real honour to be in the chamber to listen to it know little about what she be go through because my father also die of brain tumour like my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch will work with the hon lady if she would like that to bring her plan forward hopefully it will be take up because it be jolly good plan and know what she be go through it be pleasure to speak in this debate because get to talk about peterborough my favourite thing to talk about be go to do that very briefly at the start and then there be several other thing want to mention however before go on to the meat of my remark want to mention little lad call louie clarke whom meet relatively recently he raise considerable amount for little girl who be particularly ill and suffer from rare genetic condition he cycle from one side of the city to the other raise about and contribute it to the fundraising effort overall this little community raise over for that little girl just want to put that on the record before talk about other matter relate to my city be incredibly proud of my home city of peterborough the city grow up in but be not blind to the challenge associate with it we do have challenge and the good people of peterborough expect to come to this place and raise they the issue want to raise relate to st michael gate street in parnwell parnwell be lovely community with street such as keys park and finchfield which be occupy by more elderly resident it also have family home on martinsbridge and whitacre and socially rent home on henshaw and whittington it be community that just kind of work however since august there have be increase concern in my city about st michael gate other local authority be utilise this area to house homeless household to meet their own statutory duty under the housing act these be not peterborough people they be inevitably be ship from london and house in my city on behalf of council that be basically disregard their duty to house their own homeless family the legal constraint regard move household and place they outside the local area be govern by section of the housing act which acknowledge that accommodation should be provide in an authority own district as far as reasonably practical peterborough city council have therefore write to local authority know to place household in this way ask they to be mindful of this legislation because the situation be have serious impact on the community just talk about the short term solution be put upon this community in peterborough be have severe impact on local service local area can not cope there be great local school the lime academy that specialise believe it or not in traveller child the number of child it be be force to accept from outside peterborough be have serious impact on the equilibrium of that school it have huge impact on stars nursery huge impact on the gp surgery which be close at the moment and will come on to that in minute the situation be have huge impact on the whole community and many local resident and business owner have raise concern about antisocial behaviour in the area thank the hon gentleman for his offer of help would love to accept that offer and any help he can give in find cure for glioblastoma appreciate the problem he must have in peterborough and be sure many london council be place homeless family there to put the situation in context the reason for that happening be that there be currently homeless family in london include homeless child one in londoners be homeless and one in child in london be homeless that be one in every class the pressure for all london council be how to meet their legal responsibility and find home for people on temporary basis and his town be feel the impact of that peterborough be not just feel the impact it be feel colossal impact on local service it be also sometimes not fair for the vulnerable people be move from london inevitably to place such as peterborough how particular council in london seek to deal and cope with this problem be also postcode lottery in certain area the council recognise that these placement be have an impact on peterborough and will work with the local authority in peterborough to deal with it but other simply wash their hand of it something have get to give will do what can to prevent peterborough from be place where local council can offload what would say be some of their homeless and what they would consider to be their problem resident it be not the right attitude and we need to do something about it also want to talk quickly about park home resident many of my constituent across peterborough have raise concern over law that allow park home landowner to claim commission on the resale of home there be many park home site across peterborough include fengate mobile home park keys park pioneer in eye and site in werrington that be why feel compel to raise this issue today that commission be wholly unfair on what be typically people from the elderly generation who own their own home some of the impact may be short term but unfortunately all can not make back what they have put in due to this law have see that the park home owners justice campaign have create petition that have gain ten of thousand of signature commend my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley on his support for this cause we must make sure that we protect everyone from exploitation and call out unfairness wherever we see it take off someone home on top of any other taxis they may pay be just wrong just talk about parnwell and the surgery there and put on record my congratulation to my constituent rahul ramechandra who start petition to save that gp surgery or for it to reopen at the very least far too many people be take taxi to ailsworth and the closure be have profound impact on that local parnwell community be sure that those on the front bench would agree that two year or month be long enough to solve this building problem and be concerned that inertia have set in and we will see the situation go on and on want to raise slightly different issue on sunday september just over week ago attend the celebration of gibraltar national day just below the great rock of gibraltar with many other member from this house the first national day be hold in to mark the anniversary of the sovereignty referendum it be now wonderful annual celebration of the national pride of gibraltarians

that the proud people of peterborough stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of gibraltar in thank they for their military service and celebrate their freedom and self determination before finish want to mention two more issue first firework be be set off at all time of the night and at all time of the year it have become serious issue in peterborough these be not one off incident but recur nightmare plague many of my constituent they be not merely an annoyance they cause misery to many the law regard firework be crystal clear however it be evident that substantial number of individual choose to flout the regulation with impunity many of the report receive be about firework occur in the early hour of the morning blatant violation of the law despite bring that to the police attention many time these incident still continue in recent survey that do online more than constituent respond and there be overwhelming support for ban on firework other than on bonfire night and new year day the result be clear we need to look at change in the law to resolve this problem finally want to talk about bipolar disorder friend of mine who work for bipolar uk the bipolar charity ask to support his initiative to bring more attention and awareness of bipolar disorder to parliament it be pleasure to be part of the bipolar uk parliamentary reception host in november last year along with other commissioner we help to launch the bipolar commission with recommendation on diagnosis and care pathway the commission aim be to reduce the risk of suicide and to transform healthcare for people live

condition such as bipolar affect people career their quality of life and their relationship with family and friend we need to ensure that diagnosis be fast and that appropriate support be available

vaz start her remark on the removal of ticket office that be not an england only issue as we discover in westminster hall last week because there be plan to close ticket office in both glasgow and edinburgh hope that the government listen not just to the hon member but to the many government back benchers who contribute to last week debate who make their thought on that topic very clear they also intend to continue to raise the issue because people be concern about whether the consultation be actually consultation at all people have doubt about that when they hear that the worker involve have be give notice of potential redundancy and that some train company be already advertise and investigate let out the space where the current ticket office be hope the minister will give the house an assurance that there be genuine consultation on the proposal believe they should be scrap and think that belief be share by number of member across the house look forward to the minister response to that as someone with trade union background think it be important to visit picket line it be an opportunity for member of the house to hear what constituent have to say about such dispute hope the minister will hear out when say as chair of the pcs parliamentary group and as my party justice spokesperson that be concerned about the dispute in the court of england and wales about security guard and outsource worker they have be give derisory pay offer and hope the minister will be able to tell we what the government be do about that note that even the newspaper be go on strike include those who work for national world which include the scotsman and other paper offer they full solidarity and support it be amazing to see that even the newspaper be go on strike the reason they be be very simple the continuation of the cost of living crisis far too many people across these island be struggle with the cost of food many of they be in work many be receive state support and many see that state support deduct every month in universal credit deduction crazy system yet they also see supermarket post record profit far too many people be struggle to make their mortgage payment yet they see

surely need to be on deal with that imbalance while that imbalance exist more people will suffer unnecessarily as say my hon friend the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn have give the pleasure of be the justice and immigration spokesperson and feel it be necessary to raise the issue of mears the home office provider of asylum seeker accommodation be concerned to hear about the change it be make to how it provide asylum accommodation and more importantly how about it evict people in that situation two thing seem to be go on first when someone receive negative decision it evict they right

leave the property but that constituent have not receive home office decision that constituent be still wait on home office decision yet be give letter from mears ask they to leave the property then there be how mears treat people who have be give refugee status people who have be give the status of sanctuary on these island be now receive court order to the sheriff court to tell they that mear will evict they frankly if we be welcome people to the united kingdom and say to they that they have citizenship and status to remain in this country why be company home office provider take
