physical spiritual and psychological wellbeing have see at first hand the intimate bond and relationship establish between staff volunteer patient and family the hospice be one of the large provider of palliative care education in the world for all those reason we in beckenham and penge all support st christopher hospice which be huge part of our community be fundraise for the hospice long before become an mp and continue to do so people help in lot of different way and want to give special mention to penge fest which be south east london answer to oktoberfest local business such as brewery the three hounds and designer drapes organisation include friend of cator park and penge business improvement district and many more come together with local resident for day of fun and fundraising that include an oompah band the event bring penge high street to standstill last summer we will continue to fundraise for st christopher hospice but we should not have to do so to pay for the basic support our hospice benefit everyone from the nhs to patient and that be why welcome the government announcement just before christmas of an extra million in hospice funding through the extension of child hospice grant that will ease the strain on hospice and benefit patient as well as the wide health and care system however hospice still face pressure include increase demand for service the rise cost of provision and discrepancy in funding across the country which many member have mention this evening that be why as the minister recognise hospice must be key part of the government plan to shift care into the community include through the provision of at home care service that can ease the acute pressure on the nhs invite the minister to visit st christopher to see its fantastic work for himself and to discuss the role of hospice in the government commitment to ensure that every person have access to high quality end of life care thank the hon member for wimbledon again for secure today debate and the government for the vital work that they be undertake on this important issue hospice in devon be already struggle before the government budget last autumn which introduce hike in employer national insurance to talk first about the national picture we have hear that third of funding for hospice tend to come from the state through the nhs however in devon it be less than fifth for hospicare charity base in exeter the figure be while for seton hospice at home and sidmouth hospice at home the figure be they do not receive any funding at all from nhs devon last year get together with ben bradshaw and simon jupp the former mps for exeter and for east devon we put aside our political difference simon jupp and be contest the seat of honiton and sidmouth at the time write to the chair of nhs devon the brilliant sarah wollaston and secure an extra for hospice care in devon none the less the charity hospicare still have deficit of million per year follow the national insurance announcement last autumn the guardian report in mid november that whitehall be consider option to relieve the financial pressure on hospice it suggest that civil servant be weigh up the possibility of offset the ni rise fund hospice nursing staff directly or set up direct funding pot for hospice follow the announcement on december and the christmas gift of capital funding for hospice it seem that the government choose the direct funding pot for hospice the problem with the additional capital funding be that lot of hospice do not have physical building they do not have infrastructure they provide nursing service and hospice at home so they can not simply offset day to day spending with that capital spending they be completely miss out and that be the experience for seaton hospice at home and sidmouth hospice at home service in my east devon constituency in conclusion these charity step in where the nhs do not provide care be central to the government vision of shift treatment from hospital to community yet the current trajectory seem to be force patient back into overstretched acute hospital
