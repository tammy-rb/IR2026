and the hon lady have tell they to lobby the government the department for culture media and sport for that money at the same time the church have already spend million on this project with the aspiration of take it to billion when the charity commission have yet to deliver its verdict on whether that be within the charitable objective allowable how have that be allow to happen these be two separate issue what be go on in relation to funding for project spire be totally separate to any other funding the list place of worship grant scheme be separate scheme the building for mission fund that support our church be totally separate al ahli hospital what information the church hold on the operational situation of the anglican al ahli hospital in gaza the israeli attack on patient and medic at hospital be abhorrent as have say on many occasion the church be in close contact with the diocese of jerusalem which oversee the al ahli hospital in gaza the challenge of operate while under

parish initiative include food bank credit union warm space school club and other form of family support for too long charity faith group and church such as my own st bede have be support people struggle to get by do my hon friend agree that our child poverty taskforce need to seriously consider scrap the awful two child benefit cap because rely on charity to lift child out of poverty be

know that the bishop of derby host baroness sherlock the child poverty unit and colleague for roundtable where many issue be discuss church across the country be do amazing work tackle poverty but they could be do more many of my constituent will be surprised that the church commissioners have already spend million on project spire when it be not within their charitable objective and that they plan to spend million when the charity commission have not sign that off why be the church commissioners do something that be not within their charitable objective no decision have be take on that when the board of governor and the church of commissioners make that decision they will follow the right process to do so business of the house will the leader of the house give the house the forthcoming business the business for the week commence july be as follow monday july second reading of the pension schemes bill tuesday july remain stage of the football governance bill lords

house and all member will want to join in recognise this year as the anniversary of the announcement by the government of national health service by sir henry willink in most of we wish to celebrate an anniversary would probably have bit of party maybe get few friend round order in some pizza and put up decoration only the labour party would seek to celebrate its first year in office with the kind of charlie foxtrot multidimensional legislative omnishamble that we have see in the past few day give their three massive reverse ferret of recent week must say have think that the government have perfect the art of the turn after all they have have turn on winter fuel payment and the two child benefit cap each in its own way little masterpiece of slow motion dithering and indecision but then the other day the government up their game significantly by execute comprehensive turn on their decision to hold statutory inquiry into groom gang have repeatedly say that it be not necessary brilliantly the prime minister manage to turn at the same time on his own speech about the uk be an island of stranger naively believe that that be the state of the art the government have maxe out on turn and nobody could be more bewilderingly incompetent than that how wrong be on tuesday we see something that be almost unheard of in the year of our parliament minister pull out his chainsaw and disembowel his own government flagship welfare bill in mid air on live television from the dispatch box really mr speaker that outstrip my poor power of description we need the pen of shakespeare or thackeray to do it justice it be the quintessence of cock up but actually mr speaker this past week have be much bad even than that just as nick clegg be define by his turn on student fee so the prime minister will be define by this moment new and supposedly reform government with an enormous majority have be unable not to cut but to reduce the rate of increase in public spending on benefit let alone make any serious actual reform to protect people there have be remarkable complacency about this government and this past week have show it up they regard disagreement as something to be ignore or crush they do not answer question at the dispatch box they obfuscate on write question they try to ignore the opposition they dismiss the house of lords and they spurn their own back benchers loyal labour mps concerned about disabled people have be try to get hearing on this issue for month only to be repeatedly reject and this have be the result three thing follow from it first there be the immediate consequence it will be next to impossible now for the government to achieve meaningful reform of the welfare system they have show that they have no ability to make saving taxis will go up while the economy continue to stall little wonder the gilt market explode during prime minister question yesterday secondly the prime minister have open the door to future rebellion indeed he have go far than that he have write the playbook for they doubtless he will have reshuffle sometime soon loyal dissenter will be punish the talented cast out and select committee chairs buy off but that will make no difference there will be other the select committee chairs have show that they be powerful new force in labour politic finally the prime minister have massively damage his own reputation he have endlessly harp on about the need for professional competence and moral seriousness but this have be year in government that start with host of undisclosed personal gift receive and have end with utter political humiliation he have show that he be in office but not in power what be the point of this government no one know not even the prime minister start by send all our condolence to the friend and family of liverpool football club star diogo jota follow the shocking news of his and his brother death in tragic car accident it come only two week after his wedding and after win last

the first female chancellor who have be do very difficult and formidable job hon member hear hear quite honestly she have more class than most opposition member include be sure some on the front bench as the shadow leader of the house have ask to do so may update the house on the universal credit bill as it will soon be rename completely acknowledge that how this business be manage be not the way that it should have be the process do not live up to the standard to which and the government hold ourselves however as say last week we value the contribution of member especially those with particular experience of and interest in these issue critical to any good legislation be that it reflect parliamentary opinion and believe the bill now do that think it be actually good thing that we be prepared to listen and change but member should rest assure that we will take stock and reflect on how we can do thing well go forward the bill as amend and the timms review alongside it now reflect the reform and safeguard that the house want to see and we will consider its remain stage next week the bill title will become the universal credit bill as it will be narrow in scope it will focus on end the perverse incentive in universal credit protect the income of those currently in receipt of the universal credit health element and end the reassessment of those with the most severe condition and clause relate to personal independence payment will be delete any future change to pip will come only follow the timms review co produce with disabled people and the body that represent they we can all agree that the welfare system need reform and need to be sustainable the conservatives should quite frankly be ashamed of their legacy which need address it be legacy of one in working

have receive reply this week which may interest you mr speaker and other the definition of step free access mean lift ramp and level surface so you do have to use stair or escalator and can avoid the

champion of child who live in temporary accommodation and highlight the blight it cast on their life we absolutely have to tackle the very high number of child live in temporary accommodation and she

issue which many of my constituent raise with as well recently do an unannounced visit to one of my sort office to meet staff there and see at first hand that staff morale be low and people feel unable to provide the service that they be there to deliver encourage he to continue to raise that issue directly with royal mail he have other opportunity to raise it in the house perhaps with the

so people can see gp nurse physio care worker and therapist and they can get test scan or treatment for minor injury all under one roof the nhs will be organise around patient rather than patient have to organise their life around the nhs it will be easy and fast to see gp we will train thousand more end the am scramble provide same day consultation and bring back the family doctor if you be someone with multiple condition and complex need the nhs will co create personal care plan so your care be do with you not to you pharmacy will play an expand role in the neighbourhood health service they will manage long term condition treat condition such as obesity and high blood pressure screen for disease and vaccinate against it we will also reform the dental contract to get more dentist do nhs work rebuild nhs dentistry over the course of this plan the majority of the million out patient appointment do each year will be move out of hospital the funding will follow so great share of nhs investment be spend in primary and community care the second shift be from analogue to digital no long will nhs staff have to enter seven password to login to their computer or spend hour write note and enter datum our plan will liberate frontline staff from the part of the job that they hate so they can focus on the job that they love care for patient for the first time ever patient will be give real control over single secure and authoritative account of their datum the single patient record will mean that nhs staff can see medical record and know patient medical history so they can provide they with the good possible care wearable technology will feed in real time health datum so patient health can be monitor while they stay in the comfort of their own home with clinician reach out at the first sign of deterioration the nhs app will become the front door to the health service deliver power to the patient you will be able to book and rearrange appointment for you your child or love one you care for get instant advice from an ai doctor in your pocket leave feedback on your care and see what feedback other patient have leave choose where you be treat book appointment in urgent care so you do not wait for hour and refer yourself to specialist where clinically appropriate of course patient can already do all that but only if they can afford private healthcare with labour plan every patient will receive first class service whatever their background and whatever they earn the third shift be from sickness to prevention work with the food industry we will make the healthy choice the easy choice to cut calorie we will roll out obesity jab on the nhs we will get britain move with our new nhs point scheme and we will update school food standard so that kid be feed healthy nutritious meal we will tackle the mental health crisis with support in every school to catch problem early support with virtual therapist for those with moderate need and dedicated emergency department for patient for when they reach crisis point the science be on our side the revolution in artificial intelligence machine learning and big datum offer golden opportunity to deliver well care at well value new innovator passport and reform of the national institute for health and care excellence and the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency will see medicine and technology rapidly adopt robotic surgery will become the norm in certain procedure so patient recover from surgery at home rather than in hospital bed the nhs will usher in new age of medicine leapfrogging disease so that we be predict and prevent rather than just diagnose and treat it be therefore the ambition of the plan to provide genomic test for every newborn baby by thank to my right hon friend the chancellor this plan be back by an extra billion year by the end of the spending review period as well as the big capital investment in the history of the nhs alongside investment come reform this plan slash unnecessary bureaucracy and devolve power and resource to the frontline it abolish more than body because listen to patient guarantee safety and protect whistleblower be core business for the nhs and should never have be outsource the plan commit to publish league table to rank provider we will intervene to turn around fail provider and we will reinvent the foundation trust model in new system of earn autonomy pay will be tie to performance so that excellence be recognise and failure have consequence tariff will be reduce to boost productivity block contract will end with funding tie to outcome the plan give power to the patient so hospital be financially reward for well service it close health inequality by invest more in working class community and it establish national investigation into maternity and neonatal service to deliver the truth justice and improvement that bereaved family deserve be sometimes tell that nhs staff be resistant to change on the contrary they be cry out for it they suffer the moral injury of see their patient treat in unfit condition they be one drive innovation on the frontline so their fingerprint be all over this plan the public be desperate for change too each of we have our own story about the nhs and the difference it make to our life we also know the consequence of failure to succeed we need to defeat the cynicism that say that nothing ever change we know that the change in our plan be possible because it be already happen we have tour the length and breadth of the country and scout the world for the good example of reform if australia can effectively serve community live in the outback we can surely meet the need of rural england if community health team can go door to door to prevent illness in brazil we can certainly do the same in bradford we know that we can build the neighbourhood health service because team in cornwall camden northumbria and stratford where be with the prime minister and chancellor this morning be already show we how to do it we will take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs we will apply to good example of innovation from around the world to benefit people here at home above all else we will give power to the patient this plan fulfil nye bevan commitment in to put megaphone to the mouth of every patient it will restore the found promise of the nhs to be there for we when we need it of course we know that there be those on the right who be will we to fail they will exploit the crisis in the nhs in order to dismantle it the hon member for clacton nigel farage and his crony argue that universal healthcare could be afford in the century but not in the labour reject their declinist pessimism and so do the public but that be the choice it be change or bust and we choose change we know that the british people be count on we it fall to we to ensure that the nhs not only survive but thrive and we will not let our country down of course if we succeed we will be able to say with pride that will echo down the decade of the century that we be the generation who build an nhs fit for the future and fair britain where everyone live well for long commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for his typical courtesy in provide advance sight not only of his statement but of his plan be grateful and other on the government front bench might learn thing or two from he be pleased to see the plan publish this secretary of state be rare thing these day one whose announcement do tend to survive largely intact for more than week in the case of the plan it be vital that it do stick the secretary of state be not know to be short on ambition and to be fair that be reflect in his plan it be ambitious believe that his long term goal be right and that the reform he have set out build on the reform that the conservatives set out and carry out the desire to shift care from hospital to community to well use technology and to move to prevention be not new at all but it remain vital the nhs undoubtedly need reform not just more cash it be not fiscally sustainable in the long term to have of day to day government spending go on the nhs so we need to focus on outcome not just input but the plan while welcome be still sketchy on some of the detail of delivery and how it will be pay for without the fund that the secretary of state mention be eat by pay rise and by inflation as well as how that shift will be staff great use of the app be right and build on the amazing work do on the app by my right hon friend the member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay when he be secretary of state great use of technology and of genomic be right and the secretary of state big five tech bet be largely right but as he know tech alone will not deliver this people will so workforce plan that be clearly align with his strategy be vital neighbourhood health centre be one of the measure at the heart of the secretary of state plan the concept be an interesting one but it do throw up number of question that hope he can answer in the spirit in which they be ask will the provider of those new centre be nhs public sector organisation private sector organisation or mixture how will the centre fit with gp provision and other service without duplication or fishing in the same pool for staff what assessment have he make of the cost of new building and technology to go in they how many centre do he envisage and by when crucially how will he ensure that public private partnership model will avoid the downside of the brown private finance initiative model ask those question from desire not to see this fail but to succeed because it be in all our interest that the secretary of state do succeed but that will take time give that on page of his plan he talk about the need for immediate opportunity to be seize although there will be other may take the opportunity to suggest just one he should deliver on the pre election commitment for fracture liaison service to be deliver in all community as campaign for by the royal osteoporosis society the mail on sunday the express and many other that policy would deliver saving within the comprehensive spending review period similarly melton mowbray in my constituency have fantastic community hospital there will be many up and down the country and hope that such hospital will be part of deliver more service in the community on maternity care welcome the secretary of state commitment to national investigation into maternity scandal but hope that will not stop he from deliver on the work do by the hon member for canterbury rosie duffield and theo clarke which include measure that can be implement now to help improve maternity safety on system reform may offer the secretary of state couple of word of caution one be on fold the health services safety investigations body into the care quality commission even as discrete entity within it hssib be not regulator and be not design as such and it be important that those distinction be not blur in make that change similarly may urge he to be wary of far move integrate care board to large geography they be at risk of become again the old regional health authority as that will move they far away from the local community they serve and the entity provide social care in those community with whom they must interact that bring finally to significant question hang over the plan unless we move fast to adjust to the challenge of social care and put it on sustainable footing these reform risk fail to seize the genuine opportunity present in the move from cross party talk to an independent commission we risk lose that opportunity crucially ask the secretary of state again to consider bring forward the end date of that commission so that we can go far and fast on social care have often say to the secretary of state that where he be wrong we will rightly hold he to account and challenge he but where he be right we will offer constructive support the plan by and large do say the right thing we must shift to outcome and not focus continually on input and we must do that through real and genuine reform the challenge he face will be in the detail much of which be still to be confirm and crucially for the government in the actual delivery he should not underestimate those challenge will work with he to improve the plan where it need it but will support he where he pledge and bring genuine reform to our healthcare system his plan will have key test will patient see the difference and when will they see the difference in all that we do it be vital as we reform our nhs that patient be at the heart of our deliberation and our plan thank the shadow secretary of state for his constructive approach to what do need to be successful plan for the next decade to get our nhs back on its foot to make it fit for the future and to make sure we improve the health of the nation aside from the line that he be no doubt give to trot out at the beginning he almost say they with conviction we know that we can count on he to be rather more serious and sensible than the display we see from the opposition yesterday turn to the shadow secretary of state point he be right to say that investment need to go alongside reform that be why the spending review only matter of week ago set out the chancellor commitment to the nhs and nhs reform the government be provide billion real term increase billion cash increase in annual nhs day to day spending by that funding will support the first step towards deliver the reform the service improvement and the new technology set out in the plan but investment alone be not enough one of the reason we be pay more and more for bad and poor outcome be that we have the wrong care in the wrong place at the wrong time contrary to what we read in some newspaper column on the radio this morning hear the hon member for clacton once again attack the nhs equitable principle and funding model the problem be not the model of funding it be the model of care that be why the shift to neighbourhood health be essential for deliver well outcome for patient and well value for taxpayer the technology come down the track and indeed the technology we already have will drive the big productivity gain in the system that have elude we in recent year the previous government invest in more staff but they put all those staff in hospital to work in an undercapitalise nhs if there be more input but not the enabler to deliver the service we do not see the respond improvement in output and impact that drive poor productivity poor value for money and poor outcome for patient and that be the approach that we be change if for example we roll out as we will ambient ai to all gps and we make sure that in their interaction with patient we liberate they from be glue to the screen fill out the form and draft the letter because that be all do automatically before the gp spend few moment check over to make sure it be right if we can just save second in every gp appointment we will save the equivalent time of more gps that be how we get more bang for the buck that be how we drive productivity improvement and that be how we deliver well care and well value that be why the previous government workforce plan be not right it assume that the nhs just need growth at the same rate and in the same way as always in fact so implausible be the assumption in that plan that if we have continue with the rate of growth that they have set out by the end of the century of our entire country would be work in the nhs know we love the nhs and we love the people who work in it but do not think that everyone in our country can or should be work in the national health service to reassure the right hon gentleman we will this autumn set out new workforce plan that align with this year plan the shadow secretary of state ask about neighbourhood health centre we aim to go for to new neighbourhood health centre by the end of this plan and to over the course of this parliament they will be nhs provider and we will have combination of new build and the refurbishment and rejuvenation of underutilised exist estate both in the nhs and in the public sector therefore the cost of each neighbourhood health centre will vary from the low million to around million depend on whether it be an upgrade refurb and expansion or new build give the undercapitalisation of the nhs that we inherit even the record investment from public source that the chancellor have provide will not be enough to deal with the capital backlog that be why as set out in the government infrastructure plan with care and caution and keep in mind the mistake that be make by the private finance initiative we be look at alternative private source of investment to make sure that we can go far and fast on capital improvement particularly in the neighbourhood health service the right hon gentleman ask to commit again to fracture liaison service those service have demonstrable impact on keep people well and provide both well outcome for patient and well value for taxpayer that be why we want to see they roll out across the country on maternity welcome his support for the investigation nhs england be in the third year of the three year plan put in place by the previous government and we have seek to support that progress and not to interfere yet as we have see even with the most recent cqc report into the trust in nottingham we have so much more to do and an entire change in approach and culture be need let alone change in practice and behaviour be committed to work with all parliamentary party group across this house and to make sure that the expertise and insight that we have right across these benches on both side of the chamber help we to drive maternity improvement he ask about we roll hssib into the cqc let provide he with this reassurance hssib have be really effective body but we can not justify the duplication of back office function and the inefficiency that come with that however the cqc when we come into office be in such dire state that we have to replace the leadership and we have in place an improvement plan the house therefore have my assurance that we will not roll hssib into the care quality commission until we be assure that the cqc be back to the standard that we expect for it to perform its core duty today let alone the work it will do with hssib house within the cqc on icb will not measure success through the number of body in the nhs think that have lead we to where we be however be committed to make sure that as we devolve more power more responsibility and more resource close to the frontline to system leader and to provider leader we also make sure that we have in place democratic accountability so that members of parliament local council and metro mayor can influence and shape healthcare where they live the right hon gentleman also ask about social care we be not wait for casey the spending review give an additional billion to social care we be deliver the big expansion of carer allowance since the and significant increase in the disabled facility grant the deputy prime minister and will also shortly set out how we will deliver the first every fair pay agreement for the care workforce build real social care progression on neighbourhood health social care have to be part of it in the context of this plan social care feature because it have role to play on admission avoidance and speed up delay discharge however we know that social care be important in its own right and that be why it be important that it have its own commission finally the shadow secretary of state ask about whether people will see and feel these improvement we know on the government benches that we will be judge by result and by whether people can feel the change that we be deliver all would say to people watch our proceeding today be this in our first year we promise million more appointment to cut waiting list we double that we promise to deliver more gps we have almost double that and we promise that people would see the nhs move in the right direction waiting list be at the low point for two year we know that there be more to do but hope that the progress people have see under this labour government reassure they that when it come to our national health service if anything we under promise and over deliver we know that people will see and feel the change say respectfully give the shadow secretary of state constructive tone that that will be the difference between labour government and conservative one call the chair of the health and social care committee as the act chair of the health and social care committee be delighted that the year plan be finally launch today thank the secretary of state for health and social care for present it to the house the plan represent major opportunity for constructive reform of the health and social care system and be delighted that the secretary of state will come to the committee on july to be scrutinise on it many organisation have wait patiently for the year plan to be publish will the secretary of state explain how the plan will help restore the promise of first class service in the nhs thank my hon friend for her question and for the leadership she be show to the select committee while the substantive chair the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran be off on mat leave what delight it be to see the committee chair on the terrace this week with her new baby that be really delightful and we wish she well one of the exciting thing for about today launch be just how widespread the support have be from across range of different organisation that we will need to work with to deliver the plan whether it be the royal college and the trade union the organisation that represent patient the wide range of healthcare charity or crucially frontline staff everyone be up for this change and everyone be desperate for it to succeed we will not get everything right and we will make mistake along the way we will listen and always learn and reflect we know in the government that we can not do this without effective leadership from ministers but nor can government do this alone it be now our responsibility to mobilise the more than million people who work in the nhs the more than million people who work in social care and our whole country behind national mission to get our nhs back on its foot to make sure it be fit for the future and to make sure fundamentally that we attack the injustice that lead to ill health so that we have fairer britain where everyone live well for long call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for early sight of the plan this morning after year of conservative failure plan for the future of the nhs be welcome and liberal democrats support the secretary of state in his vision to shift the nhs to community focused preventive service however seek his reassurance on some question in the page of the year plan there be only pass reference to social care everyone know that we can not fix the nhs without fix social care with so many people unable to return home from hospital to get the care they need solve the crisis in social care be huge part of move care out of hospital and into the community will the secretary of state bring forward the casey review so that it report in full this year and reinstate the cross party talk so that consensus can be reach on the future of care welcome the idea of neighbourhood health centre but how do that interact with the plan for gps the year plan imply that gp contract will encourage they to cover huge geographic area of people in north shropshire that would be two or three market town combine and would span dozen of mile can the secretary of state reassure that there will still be physical health centre accessible to all and that in area with little public transport in particular people will be able to access care when they need it finally the plan hinge on the shift to digital solution and that be not without risk the use of the nhs app be critical to what happen how will the secretary of state ensure that those without smartphone because they can not afford one do not feel confident use one or simply do not have adequate broadband or internet can access the nhs many elderly and disabled people in particular who be digitally exclude will feel worried by today announcement welcome the liberal democrat support for the plan and the constructive way in which liberal democrats have seek to work with we since the general election in pursuit of well health and social care service understand the point the hon member make on social care will not repeat at length the point make to the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar but hope the house be reassure by the action we be already take on social care whether through great funding the expansion of the carer allowance increase the disabled facility grant the fair pay agreement and ensure partnership with social care to deliver well neighbourhood health service give what we have say about the importance of datum digital connection and well system should say that in some part of the country the social care system be ahead of the nhs it make well use of datum and join up system in more effective and efficient way the nhs can learn lot from social care as well as the other way round will take on board the representation of the liberal democrat and conservative front benchers on speed up the casey commission that be duly note absolutely reassure the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan on the point that she raise about neighbourhood health centre one of the reason we want to devolve so much power in the nhs be that genuinely think that the close decision be make to the community they serve the well the outcome and the provision one size fit all approach to neighbourhood care simply will not work my constituency be on the london essex border and there be three hospital within minute drive of where live in many rural town coastal community and village across the country there be not even one hospital within that distance in fact people be drive huge distance across the country to get to hospital on our priority of roll out neighbourhood health centre want to reassure member on both side of the house that we will start with the area of great inequality and need and community where people have to travel far to their near hospital so that people can genuinely receive care close to home and indeed at home technology can play big role in that understand the cynicism about digital roll out government it project do not have great reputation historically let we be clear about that we be learn from past mistake and ensure that we have the right expert in the room to help we so much of that be about the digital clinical leadership help to marry the well scientific and technological mind in our country to the good clinical and scientific experience to ensure that we get this absolutely right we can not afford to fail or be leave behind the tragedy in the country today be that there be so many brilliant innovator in life science and med tech who be design and make thing here in britain but when it come to scale up they be ship out because the nhs have be poor partner and poor customer we will change that we will create more in britain and ensure that it be roll out right across the country staff will be liberate from the drudgery and toil of unnecessary bureaucracy and admin that can be automate and patient will have more ease convenience choice and control at their fingertip this revolution be happen and it be crucial that no one be leave behind take seriously the point the hon member make about the digitally disconnected and there be two response to that first people like who book via the touch of button free up telephone line get out of the way of reception desk and free up more capacity for face to face and telephone appointment believe strongly in horse for course and in patient choice those patient who want to pick up the phone or who want to be see face to face must be give that choice and control and we will give it to they secondly work with the science innovation and technology secretary we will deal with the fundamental problem of digital disconnection in our country knock on the door of one of my party member when be canvass down her street because have hear she be ill she open the door and ask if she be okay and if she need anything from the shop she look up and down as if have just say the most ridiculous thing and say oh no dear thank you very much but do my shopping online with my ipad we should not assume that because people be old they be naturally digitally disconnected they be some of the most tech savvy people and we have to ensure that those skill be enjoy by all in keep with the nhs principle of ensure that healthcare be available universally to everyone regardless of their ability to pay rise order some member wish to participate clearly the statement will likely impact every constituency in the country so understand why so many hon member wish to question the secretary of state it be our intention to try to call everybody but there be important business later that have to be reach may urge brevity on all member and short answer on the secretary of state health committee member jen craft will now set an example thank you mr deputy speaker the heart soul and lifeblood of our nhs be the people who work in it doubt there be anyone in this house who do not owe personal debt of gratitude to health care worker can the secretary of state reassure that the fingerprint of nhs worker be all over this year plan and that it have be design and produce with all their valuable input certainly can give my hon friend that reassurance we launch the big consultation since the nhs begin we have over contribution thousand response and almost million visit to the website so can absolutely give people the assurance that staff and patient fingerprint be all over the plan that be why we have such rich plan in which people can have confidence there be much to welcome in today plan particularly the proposal to bring back family doctor which try to do but frankly do not succeed in do when be secretary of state so we all wish he well with that but do he agree that as we seek to transform out of hospital care it be vital that we do not take our eye off the ball and allow another mid staffs inside hospital do he also agree that it be essential that the cqc give overall rating and call spade spade when it come to the quality of care in hospital so that we know whether the care deliver by hospital in our constituency be outstanding or good and if not if it require improvement or be inadequate that action can be take and life can be save strongly agree with my predecessor on that it be important that the cqc report and judgment can be understand by the public and the people responsible for carry out the improvement that it recommend via the nhs app we will have much more transparency for patient about the range of provider the quality of service and the view of other patient that will give patient the freedom to choose in more data drive way where and when they be treat there be also the importance of data drive face to face inspection by expert we can also have early warning system that would alert people who hold his office and mine that something be go seriously wrong so that we can intervene before more life be lose unnecessarily call select committee member josh fenton glynn the shift announce today from analogue to digital and from hospital to community be exactly the shift that will make the nhs stable for the future will the secretary of state elaborate on the analogue to digital point practice manager in calder valley recently say to it all very well look at artificial intelligence but it take we half an hour to turn on computer what more will he do to ensure that we improve the nhs digital offer for everyone work in the health service thank my hon friend for that question on whether people feel cautious optimism or quiet scepticism base on the experience that he describe have hear the same thing so many time love ai genomic and machine learning yep great but can you just give the basic technology that work well can confirm that in we will make sure that we create single log on for staff be not hold my breath for that to be the front page splash tomorrow but that one thing as well as save load of staff time will give they confidence that genuine change be come as always the secretary of state make good fist of an impossible job but think we all know in our heart of heart that this model which take of public funding be unsustainable in the long term he mention the australian outback have be voice in the wilderness urge he to replicate the excellent australian system which be mix of public and private will not do that again now but may ask he to at least look at australia pharmaceutical benefit scheme which ensure national procurement of medicine so that people who have medical card there get their medicine cheap than people here be always willing to search the world for way to spend taxpayer money more effectively and the right hon gentleman make some good argument on make sure that we get good deal on medicine pricing and on use the real procurement power of the single payer model but therein lie the answer to the other part of his challenge it be the single payer model create in that make the nhs ideally place to get much well value in procurement and to harness and lead the revolution in ai machine learning genomic and big datum in way that many insurance base system struggle with assure he that if there be well way of fund the nhs would have the political courage to make the argument but we look at other system of funding and conclude that that be really not the problem it be not the model of funding it be the model of care and that be what we be go to sort out when knock on door in my gloucester constituency hear time and again about the importance of tackle the am scramble for gp appointment and the difficulty many of my constituent face under the conservative government get the care they need will my right hon friend explain how labour year plan for health will deliver on the government mission to get treatment out of hospital and into the community so that every one of my constituent can get the care they need in the community in which they live be grateful to my hon friend for his question he be such strong voice for the people of gloucester we be already deliver improvement in general practice with more gps employ on the frontline million more for general practice and the first contract agree with gps for quite some year we be work in genuine partnership with gps who will be at the centre of the neighbourhood health service and of neighbourhood health centre be determined to ensure that we do thing with our friend in general practice not to they where thing be work have no interest in go in like bull in china shop and impose top down change unnecessarily we learn that lesson from lord lansley be confident that we have plan that gps will relish and embrace and that they will feel reassure that the future of general practice be bright after year of campaign for government to rebuild general practice they finally have government who be on their side thank the secretary of state for his statement on his plan note the comment on the national institute for health and care excellence and the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency but the scottish medicines consortium be the envy of the other three nation would like to offer he an early win there be drug enhertu for the treatment of woman with secondary breast cancer it prolong life it be available in scotland and in other nation will he review the situation in england under this plan we work closely with nice to make sure that we consider in an evidence base way the case for prescribe new medicine we want patient to have access to the late treatment and technology and we work with the pharmaceutical industry to get as many medicine as possible to patient we definitely need growth in this area have counter offer for the hon gentleman notice that the scottish government be now on their fifth health plan none of the other have work we be always willing to help and will put copy of the plan in the post to my scottish counterpart but will not hold out much hope in england and wales where labour government be in place waiting list be fall in scotland waiting list be rise and we have hear astonishing admission of failure from ministers whose party have be in power for almost year it be very clear scotland need an alternative scotland nhs need an alternative scottish labour welcome my right hon friend statement yesterday be one year to the day since complete my radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer be very lucky my cancer be catch at stage and be treatable but have to ask my gp for the prostate specific antigen test that get my treatment know my right hon friend have that say he want to see national screening programme aim particularly at black man over one in four of whom will get prostate cancer people like who have family history of prostate cancer and man over the age of will he ensure that we have national screening programme as part of the year plan my hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of screening and it be brilliant to see he fight fit that be exactly the sort of outcome that we want from effective diagnosis and treatment he be also right to highlight the racial inequality in this area it can not be right in this decade of the century that black man be twice as likely as white man to die of prostate cancer the national cancer plan will come out later this year and the screening committee be look at the case he make he will find at the centre of the year plan commitment not just to diagnose early and treat fast but to tackle the gross health inequality that blight our society in way that be simply not tolerable in the century do the nhs year plan include an assisted die scheme if the present private member bill run out of time at the end of this parliamentary session and thus fall will the secretary of state reintroduce the legislation as government bill in the next parliamentary session be grateful to the right hon gentleman for that give that the bill be still pass through parliament assist dying be not refer to in this year plan but assure both this house and the other place that regardless of different view among ministers and across the house we will abide by the law of the land we will abide by the will of this house and the other place if the bill time out in the other place have no doubt that someone else will bring it back suspect it will not be government bill it be important that we have the debate and that we scrutinise the legislation well be proud of the way the house have conduct the debate my hon friend the minister for care who be not in his place now along with the minister of state ministry of justice my hon and learn friend the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman have do an exemplary job in support people on both side of the debate to give the bill the detailed scrutiny that it have here and that it will no doubt have in the other place that be credit to this house let say to the secretary of state well do this be really ambitious and excellent programme on the subject of cancer care in the past few year we have both have good experience of the nhs at its good but it be important to improve service by get the nhs to work with university and the voluntary sector in local cancer alliance will he look at what think be an unintended consequence of that if local cancer alliance be fund by an nhs trust its funding continue if it be fund by an icb as the south yorkshire cancer alliance be its funding will be cut in line with the rest of the icb budget that be not fair whether an alliance suffer cut depend on which organisation fund it will he see if he can rectify that be grateful for my hon friend support give his expertise it mean lot be especially grateful to the gps in his constituency with whom he and spend time that experience really have an impact on my thinking about neighbourhood health

but will he agree to meet those of we from the select committee cross party group of people who campaign over many year to bring this body which be still in its infancy into existence before make any further decision on it as my right hon friend say hssib be not regulator and to put it in with regulator will create confusion about what it be if he be secretary of state for transport he would never dream of put the air accident investigation branch into the civil aviation authority because they have completely different and separate function that need to be understand across the health service and it be obviously not well understand at the moment welcome the hon member constructive approach of course we be happy to receive representation on hssib would just like to outline the problem we be try to solve which be that the patient safety landscape be increasingly cluttered we have far too many body try to do the same thing cut across each other and for frontline staff and leader on the

society where everyone receive high quality compassionate care from diagnosis through to end of life palliative and end of life care service will have big role to play in our shift out of hospital and into the community the emphasis on personalisation for patient and their family and the join up between primary and community care service would be delighted to hear more from the commission it be really important that we get this right regardless of where people stand on the debate about assist dying the one thing that unite everyone across the house be belief that palliative care need to be so much well than it be today and that be what we will work on together there be much that unite we in this house about the excellence in this year plan in particular the fact that the nhs need reform

in this place be committed to roll out neighbourhood health across the country and to make sure that we particularly benefit the community with the great need that be the most poorly serve this be in no small part possible thank to the leadership of the chancellor of the exchequer and the wise decision that she have take not only have we deliver investment in the nhs but interest rate have fall

scotland nhs need an alternative that alternative be scottish labour and the leadership of anas sarwar and jackie baillie and it can not come soon enough may thank the secretary of state for answer in excess of question and the shadow secretary of state for be in attendance throughout the entire proceeding british film and high end television culture media and sport committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement on behalf of the culture media and sport committee dame caroline dinenage will speak for up to minute during which time no intervention may be take at the conclusion of her statement shall call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair not the relevant government minister however front benchers may take part in questioning be grateful to the backbench business committee for make time for this statement in april the culture media and sport committee which be very honoured to chair publish its report on british film and high end television and this sector be absolutely thriving we have world class facility at pinewood and leavesden where the inward investment mean film that could be make anywhere be be make here in the uk the development of crown works studios in sunderland ensure not just that film making be happen in london and the south east but that the money be spread out to our region where we have enormous talent on our screen there be fantastic show such as adolescence doctor who and for everybody share british story around the world in cinema british talent and location in movie such as the salt path and the ballad of wallis island which be tell be fantastic be make such an impact however this be fragile industry it have do so much to rebound from the difficulty of the covid pandemic but the us strike in show we just how reliant the uk industry be on inward investment and how vulnerable it be we can not take this success for grant it be hard earn and it must be protect our inquiry be launch in the summer of it come year after the last major committee inquiry report on the state of british film which with the willingness of successive government and huge engagement from the sector have shape policy for the last two decade however it be in need of an update so our select committee hear from film maker cinema industry body and those work on skill in the sector the previous government acknowledge some of the issue we have begin to raise about low budget british film and vfx visual effect tax credit but last year general election leave the inquiry on cliffhanger with many in the industry desperate for sequel we do not want to leave audience disappoint so with new look committee of excellent new member we have bring back the inquiry on the crisis in british high end tv the benefit and challenge of artificial intelligence and the work of the british film institute and the government our report make recommendation to the government and the bfi will not test your patience madam deputy speaker by go through they all but base on evidence from across the industry we propose comprehensive plan to support inward investment champion british content and independent film making drive up skill support people to stay in the sector help our cinema and protect our incredible screen heritage admittedly some of these recommendation be really bold we support the call of eminent creator such as the fantastic producer and director peter kosminsky for levy on streamer subscription to help fund british content other recommendation be comparatively small but important such as invite the government to review the effectiveness of their incentive for the sector or work with the bfi for screen heritage strategy in the meantime the government have publish their creative industry sector plan which happily make film and tv priority as one of their first frontier sector they have give welcome uplift to the uk global screen fund which our committee recommend they have also announce new capital fund for the national film and television school which will contribute some if not all of the skill we need madam deputy speaker if like you have be to the cinema recently you will have see the trailer for the summer blockbuster come up and be bit frustrated that the good bit have all be show in the trailer and that be where we be with the government response the area where the government agree with the committee and have take decisive action be the only new announcement in the sector plan on everything else the creative industries minister who can not be here for this statement be at risk of be the villain he might be call the government very own dr no in the time have leave will go through where we think the government have get it wrong they simply do not share our ambition for this sector and have not acknowledge the real anxiety those in sector have express and the support they have ask for the government agree with our committee that we must ensure the resilience of domestic production and protect our domestic workforce but they do not seem to have the answer on how to do so they have fail to recognise the value of research and development in the creative art and that it should be treat in the same way as for science and technology they have ignore the concern raise by film maker about access to the enterprise investment scheme and the seed enterprise investment scheme they have ignore our proposal for print and advertising tax relief which would drive investment in our cinema and independent film they have refuse to require regional breakdown of production spending which would help the government ensure that the benefit of these tax credit be share right across the uk and we have phenomenal skill and great story to tell around the uk the government welcome extra funding for the uk global screen fund be temper by refusal to engage with industry call to rejoin creative europe on skill they have rule out statutory reporting on spending in the sector despite the unwillingness of some big player in the industry to be open and transparent about what they be give back there be hope that the growth and skill levy will be more suitable for the creative industry the apprenticeship levy currently be not work but there be very little new information and know the sector be concern that the treasury may weaken the proposal for levy that work for the sector the government proposal for freelance champion be good as far as it go but it be very light on detail and long way from the freelancer commissioner that we have repeatedly ask for although the debate on ai and copyright have move on somewhat from our ping pong on the data use and access bill the government have reject or ignore raft of proposal that would have protect the intellectual property and the moral right of our creative artist know minister care deeply about our creative industry and the government have make commitment to they with the sector plan but be concerned that while they call british film and tv frontier sector so many of our recommendation base on really clear and compelling evidence from the sector have just be dismiss or ignore there be question whether the department for culture media and sport think our recommendation be wrong or it just do not have the clout with the treasury to make they happen know the minister can not be here but also know how he love cultural pun so in the hope that he will be watch this back it would be shame not to take this opportunity to say that we have great expectation for the government response but rather than offer we the full monty we be leave brasse off the minister will be before our committee next week for brief encounter to discuss the creative industry sector plan we be not rival we want to work with the government in the line of duty to get the most for this sector there be some time for they to add little sense and sensibility or perhaps some atonement if so rather than be wicked the minister could end up as british film local hero commend this statement to the house thank the hon lady for her statement and her committee for its work on this important area also thank she for mention the crown works studios site which be in my constituency so she will understand why be such proud champion of our regional film and screen industry the select committee inquiry recommend some regional element to tax incentive and understandably think the government response say that those will be consider at fiscal event do she agree that there be very strong case for specific regional element of tax incentive for the film and screen industry give its current concentration in the south east despite the potential for growth in area such as sunderland and the north east the hon gentleman make such an important point we have remarkable skill around the uk but when we go into sixth form in any of our constituency and speak to the young people there we find few who be consider career in film and tv yet if we look at the thing they be study we see that the film and tv industry have demand for all of they carpenter hairdresser accountant technician engineer and computer designer would all have place job in the industry yet the young people may not think of it we need to ensure that the opportunity for british film and high end tv be understand and nurture in every corner of our country because we have the idea the skill and the phenomenal track record and the government must do everything they can to harness those and make sure we be benefit from they congratulate my hon friend on her report and her wonderful statement as well as on all the work that have go into the report behind the scene public service broadcaster be struggle to compete with the massive budget set by streamer so what more can be do to ensure we see high quality british drama and comedy on terrestrial television my hon friend hit the nail on the head this be one of the big question underline our whole inquiry the cost of make content have rise so much it be price so many of our british psb out of the market we hear from peter kosminsky the director of wolf hall that it simply could not be make today and that the mirror and the light be only make because some of the key people on it work for free we can not carry on like that we need our british story to be hear around the world we have see some fantastic streamer make great content such as black doves and one day which do tell british story but our psb do they well than ever and we need to ensure they be get the right funding we have make some quite radical recommendation such as expand access to tax credit and levy on streamer which be particularly contentious we will continue to push for some of those recommendation the minister be appear in front of we next week and we will keep ask he these question because we need to protect our psb and ensure they be tell our great british story for year to come early this year tinsel town be film in knaresborough the benefit of see the film industry come to my constituency be clearly apparent from the get go it have give real buzz and excitement to the local community would like to see more on the regional investment side channel be headquarter in leeds just down the road from harrogate will the hon lady elaborate on how we would be well set to monitor and regulate to see the benefit of tv and film studio in our region one thing we be ask for be for streamer in particular to be feed back on how much of their money they be spend on skill and the regional impact of the investment they be make we know that it can make such difference to local area as the hon gentleman say when something be film in one of his town or city it shin fantastic light and put that place in focus it also tell story that resonate completely with our resident and inspire an entire new generation to work on those story but also to create they in future congratulate my hon friend on her statement and on the report she have produce to succeed great british film also need good audience will my hon friend tell we what she think of the government support for local and regional cinema that be really important question the committee make recommendation base on the conversation we have support by the film distributors association for tax relief for print and advertising of film the government have not respond to that but it be really important if we be to support british film to be make and the government have bring forward tax credit for independent british film with low budget we still need audience to know that they be out there for they to be support to get into our local cinema local cinema have suffer as well particularly during the pandemic we need they to be able to stay open they be vital part of our local community this whole ecosystem depend on have cinema that be flourish and functioning and british story be tell in our cinema help the print and advertising aspect of that story really be very important we be very disappointed that the government do not accept that recommendation congratulate my hon friend on the ingenuity of her statement be tempt to ask she if she be offer prize to the first person to identify all the film title she smuggle into it could she perhaps enlarge bit on one of the more disappointing response as negative as it be from the government to which she refer that be the recommendation that the government should at least conduct research into the possibility of statutory deposit scheme for the move image which assume be bit like have copyright library for film in which every film get deposit although appreciate the limit on capacity of the bfi would research such possible scheme not be positive move to the advantage of posterity my right hon friend represent the new forest which with its great beauty be remarkable setting for so many of our british film and tv show he be absolutely right that the bfi do remarkable job the select committee visit its archive to see the collection of british film and tv content go back decade right from the advent of film production and to see the remarkable skill it have in be able to bring some of that really old film content back into use this be part of our heritage we need to do everything we can to ensure we be protect it and invest in it and ensure that people have the skill to look after our film history in future so we be really disappointed with that particular aspect of the government response to our recommendation thank the hon lady and the select committee very much we be quite excited about what we be do in northern ireland where the assembly be promote the film and tv sector they be all do well with job create and the economy boost on work together we be not in competition with each other we be try to work in partnership have she have the opportunity to speak to the relevant minister and perhaps the sector in northern ireland to ascertain what they be do because always believe that the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland always work well together and that we can do the same in this sector the hon gentleman be absolutely right the northern ireland film and tv sector have be hugely successful notably for game of thrones and think that line of duty be shoot there too it have have phenomenal success again base on remarkable skill have not have the opportunity to speak to the northern ireland government but really would like to because as he say there be plenty of work for everyone we have british story that be there to be tell in every single corner of the british isles we need to make sure we be promote our british film and tv industry so we can keep tell those story thank the chair of the select committee for her statement think she fail to get bend it like beckham into her list and my constituent nick manzi will be very disappointed in she for that backbench business women state pension age financial redress relevant document oral evidence take before the work and pensions committee on january on dwp annual report and accounts hc oral evidence take before the work and pensions committee on january on pensioner poverty challenge and mitigation hc and write evidence from the parliamentary and health service ombudsman to the work and pensions committee on pensioner poverty challenge and mitigation report to the house on february hc beg to move that this house note the parliamentary and health service ombudsman phso report on women state pension age hc publish in march which find that maladministration in the department for work and pensions dwp communication about the pensions act result in complainant lose opportunity to make informed decision about some thing and to do some thing differently and diminish their sense of personal autonomy and financial control further note that there will likely be significant number of woman bear in the who have suffer injustice because of maladministration in dwp communication about the pensions act and also note that give the scale of the impact of dwp maladministration and the urgent need for remedy the phso take the rare but necessary step of ask parliament to intervene lay their report before parliament under section of the parliamentary commissioner act and ask parliament to identify mechanism for provide appropriate remedy for those who have suffer injustice follow last night horrific news just want to send my deep condolence to the family of diogo jota and his brother and to the city of liverpool would like to pay tribute to the thousand of fearless woman who have be campaign relentlessly to secure justice on this matter for decade now and to remember all those woman who have die wait for justice my personal thank go to the campaign group who have provide briefing to the all party parliamentary group on state pension inequality for woman include caspi waspi waspi cedawinlaw pension partners justice pension united waspi scotland and woman of wales as well as many individual who have be in touch my thank also go to the backbench business committee for allow this debate and to numerous colleague across the house who have be instrumental in campaign for the woman and in securing today debate as lord bryn davies co chair of the appg and pension expert state the uk pension system be design for man by man it systematically favour man with the result that they receive high state pension and even high private pension hence the gender pension gap the only feature that favour woman be that the national insurance pension be pay to woman from aged whereas it be pay to man from aged but in that single advantage be take away without consultation and without regard to the other factor that mean woman of that era be bad off financially and end up with bad pension that be bad enough what be bad though be that they be not even tell about it many woman be leave destitute some even lose their home these woman be already disadvantaged and discriminate against they begin work in an era when it be legal to pay female worker less than man and often step out of the workforce to raise family or look after love one because there be no wraparound care lose out on not only pay stamp but pay into private pension overnight these disgraceful change be dump on they without their knowledge many have already hand in their notice at work and in many case they be force to exist on meagre welfare benefit that leave they live hand to mouth existence hundred of woman begin to raise the alarm when the previous government fail to take action they escalate their complaint to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman which begin lengthy investigation span year although it choose to focus on sample of only six case its report publish in march last year uncover internal department for work and pensions memo from show that official know that considerable number of woman be unaware of the plan change while many woman feel that the report do not go far enough on suggest redress and that it be too limited in the case that it assess it confirm what the woman already know that they have suffer injustice that the dwp be guilty of maladministration in fail to properly communicate change and that redress be duly owe when the secretary of state for work and pensions respond to the report in december there be genuine hope that the scandal would finally end it be there in black and white sadly it do not and woman be leave shocked and angry while the government agree with the finding of maladministration and apologise no redress would be forthcoming far contrary to the ombudsman they actually feel that the majority of woman do know about change to their pension age base on department for work and pensions research and that send the woman letter would not have be effective which be sure most people would agree be bizarre it be pretty effective when people receive bill address to they through their door or letter about hospital appointment it be also pretty effective on the very rare but joyous occasion that his majesty revenue and customs give people tax rebate cheque so honestly why would bear woman have actively refuse to open letter with their name on from the dwp it make no sense the hon lady be make powerful speech what she say reflect some of the conversation have have with waspi woman in my constituency about not only the distress this have cause they but how so many of they simply do not receive the correspondence that they have be tell they do receive over the year about the financial situation that be come down the track the hon lady point out that the phso report find maladministration and that despite promise to address it in all their communication before the general election the government say that it be too burdensome to compensate on flat scale when that announcement be make ask the secretary of state what else could be do to support these woman many of whom have really struggle as result of this decision do not receive particularly forthcoming response so wonder whether the hon lady have have any more joy in find out what the government be go to do to support these woman if they can not bring forward the financial support on which so many of they have miss out the hon lady have be formidable campaigner for these woman in answer to her question no have not have any joyous information from the government as of yet which be why we be here today will outline why think the government statement and response to the ombudsman report be misinformed while understand the financial difficulty the government face option be available and cost should never be barrier to address injustice many of the campaign group be clear that the statistic use by government to justify no redress be misquote and misinformed paint picture that be completely at odd with the experience of thousand of impact woman as the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage have outline the ombudsman finding and the result of independent research research by the department for work and pensions in show that only of all woman affect by the change know that their state pension age be change the research itself even comment that this low figure provide cause for concern and show that information about the increase in spa be not reach the group of individual who arguably have the great need to be inform independent research include focus group study by age uk from as late as have also find that many woman believe that they be still go to retire with state pension at far the ombudsman report also focus on the continue failure of the dwp to recognise and respond to this research and feedback indeed this point be flag by the work and pensions committee in and the national audit office in but the dwp still fail to take any meaningful action pay tribute to the hon lady for her leadership of this campaign the situation be bad still than she paint it to be for the ombudsman make clear that the dwp have clearly indicate that it will refuse to comply with the ombudsman recommendation invite parliament to step in to resolve the matter this be officialdom closing rank be it not the right hon gentleman have be formidable campaigner for the woman affect and an ally in the campaign in this house he be correct will explain in moment how unprecedented it be for government to reject the ombudsman recommendation in this way and how dangerous it be in fact for our democracy and for citizen ability to hold their government to account will turn back to the statistic that the government rely on in their response to the ombudsman report instead of the clear finding that have outline the government rely on abstract figure from research carry out in and by the department for work and pensions which suggest that and respectively of woman bear in the know that their own state pension age be increase but that be not correct must flag this with the minister for clarity the question ask in the survey be crucial it be do you know that the broad state pension age be due to increase at some point in the future it be not do you know that your own state pension age be go to increase it be wrong in my view to make the assertion that and of woman know that their state pension age be change because the fact prove that they simply do not next when an ombudsman make recommendation to government as the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes have allude to the usual course of action be for the government to accept they far on this occasion the ombudsman make the incredibly rare decision to lodge its report before parliament not before the department for work and pensions which it do because base on its dealing with the dwp it already fear and know that the report would be ignore it be clear that the ombudsman realise this be an important issue and that it want government to listen there have be only eight other occasion where the ombudsman have feel the need to put down special report in this way the first be in all result in the full implementation of the recommendation save one the earl report in that case the environment agency still comply with three out of the four recommendation and on the fourth implement an alternative compensation offer can not stress enough that the decision to reject the ombudsman recommendation in full be unprecedented and be in fact dangerous as it set precedent that regardless of what an independent adjudicator recommend concern state level injustice the government can now ignore they it strip away one of the only lever that citizen have to hold the government of the time to account all the amazing campaign group that we in this house work with be clear this have be state injustice it have cause significant harm to these woman and while welcome limited government apology be without any material redress not acceptable for grave injustice that have drive so many into debt or poverty thank the hon lady for give way and congratulate she on secure this debate today she have be very powerful advocate for the waspi campaigner not just in england and wales but in scotland too and that be recognise by they do she agree that over recent week we have see that where there be will there be way if her colleague on the labour benches be to use their new find power perhaps we could find way of get the government to right this historic and grievous wrong thank the hon member for his suggestion he be fantastic campaigner for woman in scotland and have do an enormous amount of work in this house to support their cause as say early we all recognise the difficulty that the government face they inherit difficult financial situation but that be no excuse to deny these woman justice financial option be available some of which shall outline and some of which my colleague will outline too as well as refute the finding of the ombudsman the government cite cost and administrative burden as barrier but it be important to stress that there have be other large scale compensation scheme create in response to dwp maladministration the equitable life compensation scheme be key example congratulate the hon lady profoundly on secure this much need debate do she agree that it be shameful that labour make personal pledge to waspi woman over social medium as vehicle to get elect but then toss aside those promise and turn its back on more than woman include gill in tiverton and helen in bampton in my constituency as well as those across the length and breadth of the country do she recognise as do that of the british public support fair compensation for waspi woman the hon lady have be fantastic campaigner for her constituent during her time in this house say in response that this issue unite the house we be all angry about the injustice that these woman have face and we want the government to take action span various government and various administration these woman have have to fight relentlessly just for what they be owe and that be not acceptable have no doubt that there be numerous colleague at cabinet level who agree with the woman cause they may be struggle to find option and answer and that be what we be here today to provide hope that they be listen to and act on because injustice be injustice if we be say that victim of one injustice can be compensate by the government but that victim of another be not so deserving we be travel down very dangerous path there be option to cover the cost and ensure that there be no heavy administrative burden and will give few of they the ombudsman guidance on financial remedy set out its suggestion at level four on the severity of injustice scale and it estimate that such remedy would involve public spending of between billion and billion campaigner have suggest that an early stage level five be under consideration and that would cost between billion and billion in both case as lord bryn davies of brixton have highlight that recommendation and indeed any other scheme would not preclude taper the amount pay which would bring down cost considerably waspi and its sister campaign suggest bell curve model they have highlight the fact that other large compensation scheme for dwp maladministration have be viable and propose that any financial remedy could allocate the most compensation to those who have have the short notice of the long delay to their state pension age in other word support those most heavily impact in bell curve model they state that redress must be speedy simple and sensitive and they want to avoid legal action they have ask the government to enter into talk to address this very issue the waspi group propose that this remedy could take the form of one off payment that fairly take that into account but that level four should not be ceiling give that not all circumstance be identical to the six sample claimant waspi scotland have also highlight how scheme could be operate relatively easily use dwp record of date of birth or national insurance prefix on either an opt in or an opt out basis that information be readily available and would not require complex application system or the processing of such application the hon lady be make an extremely powerful case about this long stand injustice as she have point out the waspi campaigner be make really constructive suggestion to resolve the matter offer to reach out and sit around the table with the government do she share my frustration that the government be refuse to do so effectively force court process which be just lead to long and long delay when there be such clear injustice and an unprecedented rejection of the phso recommendation the hon lady be right she too be fantastic advocate for the woman in her constituency these woman should not be force to go through lengthy court battle and the government must recognise the cost of have to undertake those court battle versus the amount that they would actually pay through redress scheme ultimately the court be likely to find in favour of these woman base on the fact that we have be present with as parliamentarian indeed cedawinlaw and woman of wales both strongly support mediation route towards redress via an early neutral evaluation of group ask towards mediation with the secretary of state for work and pensions via mediator more broadly they raise concern that discrimination need to be factor into any redress mechanism state that the roll out of state pension age potentially conflict with the un convention on the elimination of all form of discrimination against woman cedaw treaty which the uk sign in as such the government should implement temporary special measure to guarantee an adequate non discriminatory pension one of the first constituent who come to eight year ago be waspi woman do the hon lady agree that after so many year so much compromise and so much willingness to talk to the government one of the thing that matter most to these woman be not so much the amount of money but the actuality and significance of be compensate the hon lady be spot on the woman have suffer an injustice and they have be ignore they should not have have to fight for so long the sad fact be that already so many woman have die wait to see justice what will it take to fix this will it take an itv drama to shine light on what have happen before everybody get angry enough to do something about it do not know the answer to that but what do know be that the fact be clear even the ombudsman report set that out and the government need to act urgently the hon lady have be fantastic campaigner in this house over the year and be sure the woman be truly thankful for her support the woman of wales propose in line with cedawinlaw that redress could be an initial lump sum to allow swift financial relief with additional payment over five year period even the previous chair of the work and pensions committee suggest scheme he write to the then secretary of state for work and pensions to suggest that rule base scheme be consider the letter describe system where payment be adjust within range base on the ombudsman severity of injustice scale to reflect the extent of change in the individual state pension age and the notice of the change the individual receive it would be quick to administer he say and inexpensive compare with more bespoke scheme he far suggest that there should also be flexibility for individual to make case for additional compensation for direct loss and that select committee chair be now minister in the department for work and pensions who know perhaps the minister could sit down and have cup of tea with himself to discuss the plan he have before he enter office any scheme must be responsible and financially sustainable so let we have look at some option on that too rise order before mr shannon intervene may respectfully ask the hon lady to consider truncate her speech little as number of colleague will want to speak this afternoon there be waspi woman in northern ireland of they in strangford do the hon lady appreciate their palpable anger about how they have be mistreat and about the injustice that they wish to see address on behalf of those constituent of mine seek the same thing as the hon lady and all of we in this chamber today the hon gentleman be powerful advocate for woman in northern ireland he be right what have happen be wrong plain and simple we need to see action today promise be come to the end madam deputy speaker do not want to try your patience there be option to make sure that scheme be financially sustainable waspi have calculate that hm treasury have save whopping billion by increase the state pension age alone other option include apply to wealth tax on asset over million which would raise up to billion year or equalise capital gain tax with income tax rate which would raise billion year apply national insurance to investment income would raise billion year end stealth subsidy on bank could raise up to billion over the next five year something even gordon brown have advocate cost do not need to be and should not be barrier to justice in january the deputy ombudsman tell the work and pensions committee that the dwp at the time know that the woman do not know and that they fail to act he say if you accept this maladministration and you accept people be affect by that maladministration there be conversation about how you factor cost into the need to do justice the trauma hardship poverty and sheer stress that these woman have be put through for decade must make justice for they matter of urgency have lot of time for the minister call on he to get round the table with these woman and to listen to they ask he to listen to the evidence put consideration of financial redress for bear woman who have suffer back on the table and allow full and adequate parliamentary scrutiny for any proposal as the ombudsman intend it be pleasure to be call to speak so early in the debate congratulate the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey on secure this debate there be not much more that can be say as she have put the case so eloquently but there be one key point want to get on the record broadly speak as the hon lady eloquently say this issue cross the house and there be broad understanding that there have be an injustice for this be about fairness and what will happen go forward if people lose faith in organisation such as the parliamentary and health service ombudsman congratulate the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey on secure this debate and thank she for her work do my hon friend agree that this be about trust in government and betrayal of trust for all of we who stand there with placard say support the waspi woman they should be follow that up completely agree with my hon friend at time when trust in government and politician be so low it be imperative that we do all we can in this place to right that wrong to get an idea of the level of support across the house would like to see vote in parliament about whether we should have fair compensation scheme whenever speak to waspi woman in my constituency or elsewhere the main thing they want be to be listen to the key thread that resonate with all these woman be that they feel completely sideline and ignore my hon friend the member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour make the point early that party of all persuasion have hold placard and make promise and pledge and the liberal democrats know all too well about the danger of make promise that can not be deliver on would like all party and all politician to be hold accountable for the promise that they fail to deliver on represent place that be broadly characterise as fairly affluent and wealthy but there be real issue with poverty in harrogate and knaresborough though it be often hide the hon member for salford eloquently make the point that when waspi woman be grow up and work they be already disadvantaged and this be further disadvantage it be incumbent on we all to right that wrong do my hon friend agree that this be an issue not only of justice but of equality between man and woman if this government be serious about tackle inequality at all level they must surely listen to the woman in all our constituency on this issue have be inundate with correspondence from constituent about this and the government must tackle it completely agree do not intend to speak for much long so will wrap up for this represent fundamental flaw in the system it be complete failure of the ombudsman if after there have be maladministration it can not get we in this place to push for the change that it have outline that maladministration be not up for debate it be finding of the report we hear harrowing story from woman who have lose house end up in debt and face horrendous situation as result of something that they do not know about this be about fix that problem and right that wrong first thank the many woman across falkirk who have take the time to campaign on this issue and to discuss the injustice do to woman affect by state pension age change and the lack of notification about those change be here on their behalf both the ombudsman and the secretary of state in her statement back in december be clear that there be an injustice in the way that woman impact by state pension age change be notify invite waspi woman in falkirk to meet in december after the secretary of state statement and what take from that meeting be that if we in this place believe that there be no injustice compensation would never have be pay regardless of fiscal circumstance if we recognise that there have be an injustice as the secretary of state and the ombudsman do we be justify in expect that we will deliver in some form the redress recommend in the ombudsman finding on behalf of the waspi woman in falkirk who raise and continue to raise these question with will use this opportunity to ask again some of the question have previously raise with the minister would welcome he address they when he sum up why can the government choose when to implement ombudsman recommendation and when not to be the awareness figure use by the government derive from study specific to woman who have be impact by the pension age change and be the decision base on cost or genuine disagreement with the finding of the ombudsman it be often say in time of financial crisis that some institution be too big to fail unfortunately in this case it be question of some campaign be see as be too big to succeed be quite sure that the real reason why the department for work and pensions be so resistant to this cause be not that it do not recognise the justice of the waspi woman cause so eloquently set out by the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey who have give excellent leadership on this cause through the all party parliamentary group rather behind the scene do not know this but be sure that be right it be put forward argument along these line there be so many of they the bill will simply be too great what more they only go to get between and each which will be anything like full financial compensation so what the point in give in to this demand be quite sure that if the number be few and the overall bill be not so significant we would not see this resistance to an obviously valid and viable cause do the right hon member agree that we can not put price on justice do indeed of course in any event the woman realise that they will not get anything like full compensation but they want the symbolic acceptance and acknowledgement of the injustice that they have receive as we have hear from those on both side of the house this resistance put at stake the credibility of the ombudsman system itself undermine that will have knock on effect in many future case the bill for implement an ombudsman recommendation and finding will not be anything like as large but people and institution will be embolden to defy the ombudsman one of the good short summary of the case be put forward in previous labour manifesto which say generation of woman bear in the have have their pension age change without fair notification this betrayal leave million of woman with no time to make alternative plan with sometimes devastating personal consequence labour recognise this injustice and will work with these woman to design system of recompense for the loss and insecurity they have suffer admittedly that be the manifesto and labour at that time be lead by the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn but that do not mean that the manifesto be wrong in what it say it be absolutely right in its summary and its recognition that something must be do indeed when the secretary of state for work and pensions be in opposition in the last parliament she be cautious in what she say about the ombudsman report but she do acknowledge the follow we will take time to give the report proper consideration too and continue to listen respectfully to those involve as we have do from the start she add we will be able to right every wrong overnight that would have be the basis for at least an attempt to give the symbolic redress and acknowledgement that think most fair minded people agree be due if the government have come back and say we can implement the ombudsman recommendation in full at the moment but we shall try and do it in stage or over period or will at least go some way towards symbolic acceptance of the wrong that have be do think most reasonable people would have understand the situation and have be willing to at least consider some sort of compromise do the right hon member agree that this be an issue of not just policy but dignity these woman voice must be hear and the government have responsibility to honour commitment make to give fair treatment and to ensure that something be do yes in way the government have fall between two stool the report as we have hear anticipate that the government would be reluctant to the right the wrong do to so many people at once but nevertheless the parliamentary and health service ombudsman feel that justice require compensation to be pay it know that there would be this government resistance so it must have mean lot to the ombudsman to still go down this highly unusual route of try to present its report directly to parliament because it feel it would not get far by deal with the government directly one might have expect the government to offer scheme that fall some way short of the ombudsman recommendation but their outright rejection of any restitution at all be rather insulting to the woman whose complaint be uphold by the ombudsman as we have hear despite the dwp claim to accept the finding and even apologise for its maladministration it be not offer penny in restitution and be rely in its response on deeply unconvincing polling exercise that supposedly find that nine out of of the affected woman know in advance that their state pension age be go to change if that be the case why do so many of they carry on as if nothing be go to change at all few moment ago the hon member for falkirk euan stainbank ask about the nature of the sampling that be do only some woman bear in the be include in the sample of nearly people survey which lead to that misleading result know the minister have great deal of expertise and strong track record on issue of this sort from his former career before he come to this house therefore appeal to he to at least reach out the hand of negotiation and discussion to accept the offer that reasonable people be make to the government and to sit down and talk to they and not to let the whole thing go through the court which would lead to an adversarial deepening of hostility and inevitably less desirable outcome for everyone concern with an immediate four minute time limit call brian leishman thank my hon friend the member for salford rebecca long bailey for bring forward this debate and for her contribution which be excellent as usual it be quite the sight yesterday to see female parliamentarian don green white and purple sash in commemoration of year since woman win the vote it seem unthinkable that woman be deny political representation but then again woman have be the victim of inequality for century the pension inequality that woman bear in the suffer from show that the political battle may have somewhat change but prejudice and unfairness still exist some colleague may feel somewhat uncomfortable with what be about to say but believe that it need to be say someone who support campaign on waspi nuclear test victim or the hillsborough law while in opposition should when they find themselves in bench role in government do everything they can to deliver justice as they say they would while hold placard or banner support and solidarity for people like the waspi woman be not transactional solidarity be not campaign tool have campaign for justice for waspi woman and that be why co sponsor the ten minute rule bill for compensation in january for year government have refuse to deliver justice to waspi woman that be wrong not deliver that justice seem like one of those tough decision that politician have to take but the truth be that this be choice and it always seem to be work class people who be on the wrong end of these choice labour government should make different choice as highlight by my hon friend the member for salford like many believe that the labour party be the vehicle for social political and economic change year ago tomorrow people vote for change change from austerity and its social consequence and from government who deny fairness to victim of many scandal and injustice want to mention the lady from the falkirk waspi branch we meet in my constituency office we sit they speak and listen to their legitimate anger about the secretary of state announcement last december their hurt today be as palpable as it be when we meet in the new year urge the government to do the right thing it be pleasure to follow the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman begin by congratulate the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey on secure this debate and on be such champion of this cause for many year indeed we have have to debate this injustice in this house for too many year whether on these green benches or in other chambers on the estate it be point of great sorrow for personally that one of my first speech as member of parliament back in be on this injustice and little could have imagine back then that would be little old three election down and still have to debate the injustice that have befall so many bear woman the hon lady cover the entire injustice so eloquently that only want to emphasise few point first we be talk of generation of woman that highly admire they be woman who suffer injustice and great disadvantage throughout their work life they be often not pay in line with their male colleague they be not entitle to the same opportunity when it come to private pension for example that injustice itself be important to highlight because it bear relevance on what we be talk about we be of course aware of the challenge initiate by the two pension act that cause the change in the state pension age for bear woman after this injustice be bring to we members of parliament from across the island of great britain and northern ireland ask many woman in our constituency to organise and to campaign we ask they to diligently undertake the various process that be available to they to right this wrong and it all culminate in the ombudsman process the ombudsman as we have hear find that there have be maladministration and an injustice and that far too many bear woman have suffer as consequence it be therefore absolutely outrageous that we have government not only disregard the recommendation in part or try to water they down but dismiss they outright as other hon and right hon member have eloquently say this go to the heart of our democracy and indeed faith in the administration and institution of the state to right these terrible wrong understand from representation make by the campaign group in my constituency both waspi and the woman of wales that they be keen to seek this resolution to ensure some justice for they and their fellow bear woman they be be very pragmatic they be willing to speak with and discuss the matter with the government plead the minister today to reconsider the opportunity that have be present by these group to discuss other way of bring resolution forward so that bear woman can at long last have some justice we should not force they to go through the judicial review process and drag they through the court far too many year have already be spend try to right this wrong we can not delay any far because estimate suggest that over bear woman have already pass away since this injustice come to light that be equivalent to one bear woman die every minute there be an opportunity here to get back round the table and urge the minister and the government to do so want to put on the record my thank to my hon friend the member for salford rebecca long bailey for this campaign reference have be make to the manifesto in she and write that section we work with waspi and all the campaign and with lord bryn davies we in the modern language co produce scheme at that point we look at how much these woman have lose how much they have be rob which be about million and they ask for back just quarter it be expensive of course it be but there be window of opportunity because we say that we would borrow that and pay it out over five year period at that point in time interest rate be so low and in fact some go into negative interest rate that we could afford it we have lose that window of opportunity and be angry that that happen be angry because do not know any mp exactly as have be say who be not photograph behind poster support the campaign pay tribute to the campaign lot of those lady have be patronise over the year it be terrific campaign in fact it be so terrific that under this government it would most probably be proscribe but there we be we all recognise now that there be an injustice we all accept that we all know that the dwp operate essentially sexist policy it admit that now the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis say it be matter of principle do not think it be matter of principle it be matter of hard cash as well because large number of people be still suffer poverty as result of what have go on all want be fair settlement and that be all they be ask for they be not go away well some of they have because they have die and this campaign be not go away we will not let it go away until we get justice for these woman what the ombudsperson have do be put the matter back to this house we in this house should be demand that this house determine the scheme itself and be allow to vote on that scheme budget be come up in november number of we will not support that budget unless there be something in it for these woman why should we why should we let this go on for another year while people suffer and the injustice go unremedied be angry about this all the promise give over the year have be renege on and dishonour that be not the way we should act as representative of our community want to be able to go back and say at least now the government be go to offer you negotiation then they will report to the house and let the house determine the nature of the scheme want that do within month not allow to drag on for year while people suffer in poverty or lose their life or their hope of compensation let we make this commitment today to be honest do not expect the minister to say much today other than what have be regurgitate year after year but let we as an assembly make that commitment today let we say that we will keep come back over the come month until we secure that commitment from the government would like it to be cross party commitment which all the front benchers sign up to so that we can have some confidence that it will be deliver like the waspi woman have have enough enough of these debate enough of promise not deliver enough of watch the suffering that woman in all our community have have to endure because of this injustice and inequity congratulate the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey on secure this debate and on her tremendously eloquent speech which remove much of what have to say in all honesty though eloquent speech be just not go to cut it they simply will not do the trick we need action note with the exception of those present the absence of so many labour mp who as other have say stand hold placard in support of the waspi case where be they today do they not understand the sense of betrayal the sense of breach of promise and the breakdown of trust that be problem that many of they will face in due course the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon speak of accountability well there be accountability and it will come at the next election when people have chance to pass their verdict will not repeat many of the thing the right hon lady say but do want to highlight couple of point the phso say some woman lose opportunity to make informed decision about their finance the ombudsman also say that parliament should identify mechanism for provide appropriate remedy for those who have suffer injustice when the budget be announce there be great expectation that there would be something in it for the waspi woman there be nothing nothing even though the dwp accept the phso finding and apologise not once but twice if someone take my wallet and discover that and come to they do anyone think an apology will suffice no want my wallet back that be the point an apology just will not cut it great number of woman affect by this mal administration be my constituent and there be many thousand across scotland participate in the debate on march in fact mention the waspi woman case in my maiden speech believe the hon member for salford speak straight after and that the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis be also present many other have much long record than do of campaign on this issue do not want to go on too long because many of the point have already be make but want to highlight one last thing the most distasteful aspect of this profound failure of the uk government be the photograph of the current secretary of state for work and pensions pose with waspi campaigner smile and hold sign pledge will work with waspi to identify and deliver fair solution for all woman affect that is frankly shameful there be one get out in fact there be number of way in which this can be redress but here be one my right hon friend the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn will tomorrow re present his women state pension age ombudsman report and compensation scheme bill if member have not sign that bill in support of it they have an opportunity tomorrow we in the snp understand the issue that be involve here we will continue to support and speak out against this injustice thank member for listen to thank my hon friend the member for salford rebecca long bailey for secure this debate from the backbench business committee of which be member and for her eloquent and informative speech financial security be something we endeavour to secure for our family and for ourselves many bear woman work their whole life with the goal of financial security in their mind eye only for it to be affect through no fault of their own will not rehearse the ombudsman judgment which stand as clear as day we have hear those word time and again specifically because this have not be appropriately remedied what never fail to shock be the live experience the testimony of bear woman be so important because the impact of their story never diminish this be about real woman my constituent ann be just one of the many bear woman who will not accept that find remedy to the dwp maladministration be neither fair nor feasible and would not represent good value for taxpayer when ann be she apply for pension forecast upon receive it ann discover that her retirement age be rather than not long before that shocking news she go from work five day week to three how be she to know that she have to work and plan for retirement over further six year she be never inform because she be now work part time it be not possible for she to substantially increase her pension contribution in at the age of ann be make redundant she have to make her small redundancy payment last she until she retire three year later life have be tough for these woman event like the pandemic when ann lose her job shake we all but event where the state have make people live more difficult just because of the day they be bear have particular degree of unfairness to they give the ombudsman significant concern that the dwp would fail to remedy the injustice it deliberately lay its report before parliament when the government announce their position in relation to the finding incredibly without recourse to parliament this reaffirm the ombudsman concern and set worrying precedent for the future we have high hope for our pensions minister his past life dedicate to improve living standard make he well suit to the role he now hold truly hope that he will re examine the government position on an issue that be so important to so many woman who continue to fight for justice the purpose of this place be of course to make law to amend they and sometimes if we be in opposition to stop law be make but it have another purpose to hold those with power to account we do that as individual constituency mps all the time take up case on behalf of constituent but this case not only affect the waspi woman in my constituency take it up for all the waspi woman inspire by the leadership of my friend the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey and other across the house it be unusual in this place for government members of parliament and the official opposition labour mps and conservatives the liberal democrats the snp the dup and plaid cymru to all come together in common cause that speak volume it say that we recognise that these woman be unjustly treat but it be not just our recognition that count the ombudsman too recognise exactly that when an ombudsman state that maladministration in dwp communication about the pensions act result in the complainant lose opportunity to make informed decision about some thing and to do some thing differently and that that diminish their sense of personal autonomy and financial control and that be just one of its finding maladministration inappropriate communication and the failure to deal with complaint punctuate the ombudsman finding for government not to respond to the ombudsman be frankly unacceptable do the right hon gentleman agree that take this step to ignore the finding of an ombudsman set really dangerous precedent that could be exploit by private company and by departments do agree with that it be case powerfully make by the hon member for salford that this case be very much about the relationship between the ombudsman and government and between this house and government that connection between independent scrutiny by the ombudsman and our ability as house to hold the government to account lie at the heart of this issue and that be exactly what be about to say this question be about the waspi woman but it be also about something still more profound hope the minister will recognise that in the decision he take he will set an important precedent precedent that will affect exactly those kind of relationship will reveal to the house what the minister already know when this matter be consider by ministers submission would have come forward from official have no doubt at all that it would have offer several option option might have be to satisfy the waspi woman in full option might have be to come to partial settlement which they perhaps would have accept option would have be to do nothing the government choose despite all the pledge in opposition by the deputy prime minister the work and pensions secretary and the prime minister himself to take that final option of do nothing find that very surprising know how reasonable the campaigner be suspect that have partial settlement be offer they might well have meet the government halfway they might have understand that the cost be substantial and that they have to compromise to some degree although let we just explode one myth that all these woman be privileged and advantaged many be not many when they face long period before they could retire be in ill health many have caring responsibility many be hard up in campaign for those woman mindful of those disadvantage we be speak for people who otherwise would be powerless minister it be not too late to get this right for the waspi woman have just cause and surely in the name of decency as well as in the name of good democracy justice must be do fully understand that the government decision announce in december last year be not about the change to state pension age from onwards but rather about how decision make by the department between and lead to month delay in send out letter to people affect by those change in march the phso stage and report find clear maladministration in the way the dwp communicate state pension age change that fact can not be dispute as direct result many woman bear in the be leave with little or no time to make alternative plan and therefore suffer injustice again that be clear and obvious would suggest to all figure from age scotland suggest that around woman be impact in scotland and over of those be in my west dumbartonshire constituency my waspi woman include elizabeth daly elaine newfeld and maureen mcgrath could list hundred who have contact to share their personal story to help understand that this be not just about figure or statistic they include liz who care for her desperately ill husband her retirement plan wreck and their life destroy by year of suffering and maureen penalise because she retire at the age of to care for her elderly mother who lose out on access full state retirement pension all my waspi woman tell that at this stage it be not about the level of need or the amount of compensation but about justice the uk government be right to recognise the injustice suffer by waspi woman in the statement to the house on december and to apologise for the maladministration that affect woman across the uk of course the step set out by the government to ensure this do not happen again be welcome but we must learn the lesson and always set clear timetable for notice of any future state pension age change however an apology be not enough urge my government colleague to look again at the ombudsman report and all its recommendation ignore key element of the report by refuse to comply with its instruction and refuse to set up compensation scheme for maladministration not only undermine its role and function but be unprecedented and set we on very dangerous path for any government to reject the recommendation of the parliamentary and health service ombudsman be extremely rare between and the phso make total of compensation recommendation only one be not comply with and be accept therefore this be highly unusual and in my opinion corrosive to conclude suggest that we should avoid unnecessary court action let we get around the table with the waspi woman and avoid year of court battle similar to other scandal over the past few decade let we urgently review and explore what scheme this government can consider and offer financial redress to the woman who deserve justice and to be properly compensate for past government maladministration rise to speak on behalf of the woman in my constituency of eastleigh who be impact by state pension age inequality and the thousand of woman across the country who be victim of department for work and pensions maladministration as say in the debate in westminster hall in march we know that the government be face incredibly difficult challenge but ignore the voice of thousand of woman be huge mistake this issue be not go to go away official report march vol my constituent chrissy receive her state pension six year later than she be expect she tell those lose year be just number they be year of struggle uncertainty and hardship the silence from the government be cruel erasure of our life the government say it too expensive to compensate we but it be never too expensive for we yet we have to live with the cost and the hardship every single day many of the woman in my constituency who be impact be leave with very little to live on blindside by the sudden loss of income they be force to return to work in low pay job to get by and in some case have to use food bank the toll on their life and those of their family should not be underestimate these woman spend decade work raise family and often take on unpaid care give role many continue to shoulder caring responsibility today the way that they have be treat by successive government be nothing short of disgraceful my constituent story be echo across the country the waspi campaign estimate that million woman have be affect woman who have be treat appallingly and feel that they do not matter and be invisible urge the government to stop gaslighte they and start listen really listen to the pain injustice and betrayal they have endure the refusal to provide compensation not only be morally indefensible but set dangerous precedent as the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey say if departments can accept maladministration yet ignore the ombudsman remedy the entire purpose of independent oversight collapse today call again on the government to do the right thing and compensate the woman who be unfairly impact by the change to the state pension age because it be the right thing to do how much long do these woman have to wait for the government to turn on state pension age inequality and give they the compensation that they deserve thank the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey for champion the cause of waspi woman who have be utterly fail by successive government will not repeat what other have say but it be clear that the government should act on the ombudsman report after the maladministration of the dwp have speak to woman in my constituency waspi scotland and across the uk these be woman who historically have face systemic inequality low wage and difficulty access the same work opportunity as man they have disproportionately shoulder care responsibility as primary carer for child and later they frequently care for elderly relative and love one with disability they continue to give their unpaid labour without acknowledgment which significantly reduce pressure and cost on our nhs and social care service be one of those woman myself after family illness my life change in an instant have to stop work and become carer and have to be at home if be not fortunate enough to still have my health and strength to become councillor later in life when my caring responsibility allow and now an mp would have be reliant on my state pension and very small private pension due to circumstance totally outwith my control the reality be that be far from be alone in find myself with caring responsibility or ill health and many of my counterpart be not in my fortunate position waspi woman like myself work hard pay into the system and look forward to their retirement base on their understanding of the system at the time at time when other be plan their pension these woman be in low pay job that be flexible enough to allow they to continue with family commitment when it become clear that corrective action be necessary the government first exploit the plight of these woman for political gain once they be in power they then ignore the promise they have make to win their seat most troubling be the government continue refusal to act despite the ombudsman extraordinary call for parliamentary intervention rather than provide decisive leadership and deliver justice the government have delay deflect and evade accountability if the government be sincere about fairness integrity and honour their commitment to support work people they must go beyond expression of sympathy concrete step must be take to deliver the ombudsman recommendation recognise both the scale of the injustice and the dignity of those involve these woman deserve well they have spend their life work and contribute to our society prevent cost for the nhs we must value their contribution and thank they implement the advice of the ombudsman be the least that the government can do for those woman who like be fortunate to have high income after reach state pension age his majesty revenue and customs and the tax system will effectively claw back large proportion of any redress and return it to the treasury stand here in support of the waspi woman in my constituency and every single waspi woman across the uk congratulate the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey on secure this crucial debate also thank she for her powerful and compelling speech which clearly present the case and evidence as well as the injustice that these woman have suffer and the clear need to address it through the payment of compensation by implement the recommendation of the ombudsman without want to repeat any of the point that have be make will read out some specific comment from my constituent in dewsbury and batley virginia constituent of mine write to just after be elect be absolutely devastate and feel betrayed for year senior labour representative and even the prime minister himself pledge to deliver fair compensation to those impact they have now make political choice to break that promise and to ignore the finding of an independent watchdog the dwp get it wrong and they can not simply adopt pick and mix approach to which element of an independent ombudsman conclusion they find convenient she go on to say furthermore in recent month all pensioner lose their winter fuel allowance have be write to directly why do the government not feel this would have make difference for waspi woman another constituent ann write need to vent my frustration and anger at the government announcement yesterday that they will not accept the ombudsman recommendation to pay waspi woman some compensation for maladministration they be in support of this whilst they be in opposition this decision be complete betrayal and breach of trust between this place and the people we represent and it must be reverse ann go on to say the people make these decision be in fortunate position themselves but be rely on their understanding and compassion for other who be less able to make up the which reckon to have lose paula write to as you know thousand of woman live in dewsbury be impact many include be leave with little time to make alternative plan for their retirement and have be affect by this lack of notice ever since she raise critical point which be that she have no notification from the dwp at all until she write to it in ask for clarification when it reply to say that she would be able to retire at that come as shock in when an extra year be add the dwp do not communicate that to she either in conclusion as the hon member for salford have clearly explain the government justification for not pay compensation be absolutely flawed the argument that it be too costly or complex to provide compensation be untrue as the ombudsman write in its finding finite resource should not be use as an excuse to avoid fair remedy as such repeat the call of members from across the house for the government to reverse their decision bring vote on compensation to this house and engage in out of court talk with waspi woman thank the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey for secure this debate she speak superbly and with great passion on the subject december last year mark shameful day for this government when million of woman bear in the woman who have give lifetime of service hard work and care to their family community and country be utterly betray as ever the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes give superb speech but take slight issue with one thing he say which be that the government do nothing if only they have do nothing we would be in well situation instead despite the clear evidence from the parliamentary ombudsman of maladministration by the department for work and pensions the government decide that there would be no financial compensation no justice only betrayal that be choice that the government make on behalf of these woman woman who face significant hardship because they be not properly inform about change to the state pension age an apology while necessary be simply not enough government can not apologise for maladministration and then refuse to put thing right it be disgraceful to acknowledge an injustice but refuse to fix it these woman deserve fairness they deserve dignity and they deserve compensation as other hon member have mention we know exactly why the government will not act it come down to money for year the liberal democrats have champion the cause of waspi woman among other we have consistently call for fair and proper compensation in line with the ombudsman recommendation in my constituency have see at first hand how deeply this injustice have affect woman life they have work hard plan carefully and trust this government to keep their promise only to be badly let down will quickly share the story of my constituent helen from seaford who be part of my local waspi group she be shocked to hear about the change in in letter inform she that the age at which she be due to retire would rise from to unbelievably that be only two and half year before she be due to retire and it mean she have to work an extra six year to be able to support her daughter properly helen spend year pay national insurance as single parent and she tell she be so angry that what she have work for have be take away from she be sure the house would agree that helen resilience and determination be inspire but she should never have be place in that position this government make cynical calculation that these woman can be ignore and that they would not fight back and would not keep push but they underestimate the strength and determination of woman across this country include in my constituency who have stand up and demand fairness this decision can not and must not stand it be bitter irony that the government be now fight in court the very people they say they would stand up and fight for urge the government to reconsider their position to listen to reason and finally do the right thing and compensate these woman now it be real pleasure to speak in this debate first thank the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey for set the scene so incredibly well and all the hon and right hon member who have contribute fantastically put across the demand of their constituent this be not new issue and we know that do not think have miss waspi debate indeed do not think the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes have miss one either in the time have be here this week in this house have give hope that perhaps the government can acknowledge when we be move in the wrong direction the government need to correct the wrong step take and follow through on the recommendation in the ombudsman report northern ireland have some waspi woman of whom be my constituent do not know all personally have not do that roll call but those who have come to have tell their story in many case they be lady who have clean floor or clean office or be classroom assistant or teacher age catch up with we all and it catch up with too it catch up with they and their knee be not as strong as they use to be they plan their pension in accordance with the timescale and then it be take away from they that be the concern have they have plan for their life and then they be deprive of that the report rightly find that some waspi woman be not inform about the change to their pension and have make long term financial plan base on the assumption that they would receive their state pension at all their financial planning be in place and then it be just take away that mean that when the waspi woman lose their pension they lose all source of income and meet unexpected financial insecurity the insufficient information be not only negligent but deeply unjust and the government have acknowledge that to be the case so there be precedent the hon member for lewes james maccleary be right to say that the process be back away from woman who spend decade raise family pay taxis and contribute to the economy be leave without recognition for their hard work many waspi woman be force back into the workforce often with disability and often into low pay job or have no choice but to apply for benefit those woman should never have have to do that after lifetime contribute to the system number of these woman call they the silent generation still face significant outstanding debt and loan that they will struggle to pay off for the rest of their life due to the inability to manage their income appropriately when they realise that they could not access their pension their ability to go back to full time hour be not simple and the emotional toll have be significant too many waspi woman now experience stress and depression bring about by financial uncertainty it be only fair that the hard and consistent work do by these lady be financially recognise say this with respect to the minister but one of the first step that this government take be to sort out the back pay of union worker be not say they should not have do that but if there be to be fairness in this system can not for the life of understand how they can do that in one breath and then in the next apologise to the waspi woman but not do right by they the silent generation be determined to be silent no long applaud they for go against the grain as we often say at home by continue to complain applaud they for continue to speak when many of they have be tell to be quiet and give it up applaud they for continue to hold government this one and the last one to account applaud they for stand beside the weary and the worn and for demand compensation for all affect apologising be not enough as the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan say it be not about word any more it be about action and now be the time refuse to believe that age be catch up with the hon gentleman call the liberal democrat spokesperson too congratulate the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey on secure the debate on campaign on this issue and on make sure that this debate come to the main chamber thank all hon member for their contribution this afternoon as well as hear the very strong and powerful case around this particular issue we have hear personal example whether it be gill from tiverton ann from newcastle helen from seaford or paula from dewsbury we have hear that many woman rightly feel sense of raw injustice and the government must act have meet waspi woman many time in parliament but have also meet they in my constituency couple of year before be elect meet group of waspi woman regret that can not recall the name of the woman whose case remember but her circumstance stick with she be quietly speak and could tell that she have real rage and fury inside she but she be not prepared to show it she just say ve spend my entire life work ve raise family ve watch the penny and be proud to stand on my own two foot but at the end of my work life feel rob of my money and rob of my dignity even though know this situation be not of my making and not my fault feel tremendous sense of shame that really stick with some million woman be affect by this issue and many of they feel sense of shame they should not but they do it be really frustrating that the government notwithstanding the terrible inheritance that they receive have choose to do nothing and there be two problem face they the first be that an obvious injustice have be leave unaddresse the second be that as so many member from across the house have say it set very dangerous precedent for some woman an offer of an apology or payment might be symbolic but it be far more than that for many of they it be about survival and it would help they to get out of the struggle that they be now in on behalf of my party urge the government please to reflect after this debate and to go back to the drawing board and think about what can be do at the very least they should think of something to help those woman who be struggle the most do nothing be really not an option if the rebellion early this week be for any reason at all it be to send message to this government that their own party this house and the british public want government who will stand up for the underdog those who be hard do by in life by the government and by circumstance out of their control hope the government listen today and act because to govern be to choose the government must know that it be not too late to make different choice call the shadow minister let start by give credit to the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey for her very powerful speech and for all the work that she have do on this campaign over the year and to many other labour members who have speak so well today particularly the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell who always listen to with respect on this topic and indeed on some other it have be good to hear from member particularly welcome the contribution of the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman who be great new addition to this place we see here the true voice of the labour party it be the labour movement at its good and pay tribute to labour members for their campaigning on this topic they be the hero of the movement we also have the hero of the conservative party behind my good friend the knight of the shire whom it be an honour to listen to it be like listen to edmund burke when my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes speak about duty and responsibility congratulate the hon member for salford and my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deeping on their work together on this campaign which few month ago secure the very significant westminster hall debate that have be mention on that day as if the product of their work out pop fresh and pink the new minister who be appoint to his role on that day as if for the very purpose of answer the question of what should be do for the waspi woman there be hope of great thing from he but be afraid to say that we be disappoint on that day he could offer no hope at all yet since then we have see whole series of turn they have become fashionable on the government front bench and who know what we may hear the from minister today recognise and be sure the minister will stress how difficult it be to address the very complicated circumstance of the very many woman catch up in the pension age change as be sure he will say the ombudsman have recognise that there be no direct impact on pensioner income from the maladministration and the miscommunication of which the dwp be guilty in the however as member have say particularly recognise the point make by the hon member for strangford jim shannon woman make decision about their future and about their life in ignorance of their true circumstance the failure by the dwp to successfully and appropriately communicate with the woman cause they to make decision that directly disadvantage they it be simply not credible and hope the minister will not advance this argument to say that correspondence from the government be essentially pointless and have no value that would be to suggest that there be no point in any government communication by post of course woman be not advise of the change in the circumstance and that be the fault of the government of the day as many member have say and acknowledge the powerful point make by the hon member for st albans daisy cooper woman deserve so much more as she say our constituent feel that they have be rob not just of their money but of their dignity as consequence of these decision what be to be do there have be series of suggestion about how we might go forward on point of process do not agree with the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon and be concerned that my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings seem to agree with he that the ombudsman report should in effect be bind on the government do not think that be appropriate because these be sovereign decision that the government accountable to parliament should be make however agree with the hon member and other that these report should be respect by the government and feel that simply do not happen in this case it be become habit of mine to intervene on the hon member he say that the report should be respect but should not be bind so what do he have in mind and how would it look it be absolutely essential that the point make in the ombudsman report be fully acknowledge by the government and it be necessary as will explain that some meaningful redress be make to the victim of the dwp maladministration the hon member for salford suggest that there could be another review of the system by the minister for social security and disability but do not think that the magic word timms review will get the government out of this hole he have enough on his hand sort out the mess they have make on benefit so this be job for this minister who be very clever man and have great confidence in he the suggestion make by some member of mediation may be usefully take forward however as my right hon friend and constituency neighbour the member for new forest east sir julian lewis say it be simply insulting of the government to make absolutely no redress and no acknowledgement of the injustice that the waspi woman have endure and it be appropriate for some meaningful acknowledgement to be make it be not for to rescue the government from the consequence of their own incontinence their fiscal folly which have get they into the mess they be in but they have make several discretionary payment since they come to power there be the salary increase for train driver without any improvement in productivity the creation of multibillion pound energy company that make no energy our pay another country billion of pound to take over sovereign territory belong to the uk and of course all the turn that have impose significant new cost on the taxpayer include those cost billion this week alone obviously government can make discretionary payment if they want to these be sovereign decision that they can make crucially any such decision must be fund we see this week that the government essentially fall apart as consequence of whole series of bad decision make in the treasury parliament rise up against the treasury and demand change the decision make at the heart of the government have be woeful for the past year since labour have come to office pay tribute to the parliamentarian who resist that this week this be new opportunity for the government to put right mistake and look forward to hear how the minister propose to do that thank all hon member who have speak powerfully today and in particular my hon friend the member for salford rebecca long bailey for lead today debate on behalf of the backbench business committee this be an important topic that she and have discuss several time both in public and in private look forward to her closing remark when we retire the question of how comfortable we will be in retirement and in the year lead up to it ot least give the growth in pre retirement poverty partly due to ill health as the hon member for mid dunbarton shire susan murray set out be crucial to all of we we ask that question of ourselves and of those we care about as the debate have show many hon member rightly ask that about the country as whole we should expect people to have strong view on the state pension age we all know woman affect by the change make since in particular that affect that age group constituent friend and family have declare family interest on this front before alongside my professional one too have many constituent who be affect and have hold up the banner say stand with waspi woman my hon friend the member for salford rebecca long bailey lay out where we can find the money surely we can promise to revisit this when the public purse allow rather than let down these woman who have be let down over and over again justice delay be justice deny always thank my hon friend for her contribution she make powerful case will come on to the reason why we do not agree with that case but understand her point this be cohort of woman who have too often face discrimination in the world of work with lasting effect on the value of their workplace pension they have bear the brunt of unequal caring responsibility and as my hon friend the member for salford set out historically the gender have have very unequal state pension that at least have be address but the workplace pension divide remain as big as ever should declare that my mum be waspi woman she would be disappoint if be not here today and there be nothing bad than your mum be disappoint in you also represent other waspi woman in my constituency just wonder if the minister really understand the discrimination face by woman include sexism and lot of discrimination in the workplace they just feel let down do the minister realise that and that they absolutely deserve justice thank my hon friend for his question know without have meet she that his mum will not be disappoint in he obviously the point he make be absolutely right it be the point that be just make think we be all aware of the experience that this generation of woman have have to face not just in the labour market but much more broadly he make powerful case as always now there be broad political consensus that it be right to equalise the state pension age for man and woman but the acceleration of the state pension age increase by the conservative and liberal democrat coalition be more politically controversial be not go to mention it but will gently remind liberal democrat members who have speak today the hon member for eastleigh liz jarvis and for lewes james maccleary use particularly strong language on this point that it be the choice make by their party not to mention that acceleration at if member be go to use strong language about difficult choice then they need to reflect on the choice that lead to that point my party oppose those choice at the time however neither the acceleration nor the long plan increase to the spa legislate for since be matter the ombudsman investigate this matter give that it be the desirability of the original policy decision make by previous government that be most frequently refer to by campaigner and by hon member include the hon member for strangford jim shannon today who focus on the increase to the state pension age in contrast the ombudsman focus be on how those change be communicate by the department for work and pensions as the hon member for mid dunbartonshire very clearly point out as all hon member know we carefully consider the ombudsman finding we always will give its important role which be set out by the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes today and in several debate that have take part in with he in recent month the minister be right to say that no party indeed no previous government can be excuse in this respect because this matter cover the time in office of several government the difference be that member of his party in opposition say this injustice can go on have be longstanding supporter of the waspi campaign and that labour will compensate the waspi woman as it be their money that be say by the current work and pensions secretary and the current deputy prime minister the right hon gentleman have be member of this house for much long than so he know how this work party set out their manifesto and be sure that if he look at the labour party manifesto he will find there different word from the one he have just share with the house the government agree that letter should have be send soon we have apologise and we will learn the lesson from that however as hon member and campaigner on this issue be well aware we do not agree with the ombudsman approach to injustice or to remedy and neither read carefully between the line of the speech from the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger do the opposition the hon gentleman speak very eloquently as always let we look at what the ombudsman say when it make its decision to lay the report before parliament it be not look ahead to what future government might do it know that the then conservative government would have come to similar conclusion hon member should remember that the long debate over those year between the government and the ombudsman be hold in private so the ombudsman be aware of the approach of the government to whom it be talk in way that those of we outside government at the time could not have know the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon and the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis ask about the decision not to accept an ombudsman finding they be right to say that it be unusual but it be definitely not unprecedented should spell out that the government have accept other ombudsman finding since so it be not right to say that this be some kind of fundamental break in the approach by government early the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell warn we that we might simply see the government front bencher regurgitation the government view today can the minister clarify whether he have be send here to defend the indefensible or will he give we something new today the hon gentleman be welcome to choose his tone will continue to the end of my comment my job be to come and explain the government decision and to be hold accountable for it that be what be do today and what will continue to do over the course of my remark it be right that the government be then ask question about their decision that be the nature of this democracy as the hon member for east wiltshire say an important consideration in the government make this decision be that evidence show that send people unsolicited letter be unlikely to affect what they know that be why letter be send only as part of wide communication campaign this evidence be not properly consider by the ombudsman another consideration be that the great majority of bear woman be aware of the state pension age change if not of change in their specific state pension age as several hon member have point out my hon friend the member for salford mention the statistic of refer to the rather than survey however as she will know that refer to all woman include some woman as young as if we look at the cohort of woman bear in the the figure be far far high on those and other ground we reject the ombudsman approach to injustice and report september vol correction members will be aware that litigation be live so will not go into lot more detail on the research evidence which be the core of that litigation will just say two thing first our decision be base on publish research report which be robust and meet professional standard secondly the same awareness research which the right hon member for new forest east disparage be use by the ombudsman will the minister explain to the house why not one single speech in this debate until his have take the line that he be take everyone who have speak in this debate believe that some compensation at least symbolically should be pay thank the right hon member for his intervention be liberal man people will come to different view on the evidence there be many member in the house who have campaign powerfully on this issue over many year and respect the work they have do on that be set out different view from the one that the right hon member have take that be the nature of policy choice the nature of accountability and the nature of this debate the ombudsman be clear that redress and compensation should normally reflect individual impact as it do in the case of the equitable life compensation scheme that an hon member mention and they spell out the challenge of assess the individual circumstance of million woman not least give that it take the ombudsman nearly six year to look at just six case the reality be that assess they would take thousand of staff very many year we give detailed thought to whether we could design fair and feasible compensation scheme however most of the scheme that be suggest would not focus on woman who lose opportunity as result of the delay in send letter rule base scheme such as that suggest by the work and pensions committee would make payment on the basis of the like of age rather than injustice simply play flat rate to all million woman bear in the irrespective of any injustice be also hard to justify fundamentally though our decision be not only drive by cost to answer directly the question of the hon member for falkirk euan stainbank but by the fact that we do not agree with the ombudsman approach to injustice or remedy for the reason that have set out indeed our commitment to pensioner can be see in the significant fiscal investment that we be make in our priority for pensioner include raise the state pension and rescue the nhs have an awful lot of affection for the hon member be there any difference between this speech and the one that be make in westminster hall as it do not look as though there be he might as well just send we the tape of the last one well the right hon member have demonstrate more affection on previous occasion be what would gently say to that if he be ask whether the government position have change be afraid that the answer from his perspective be no few moment ago the minister say that the government have conclude that it would not be appropriate to apply flat rate to all million woman have the government do any modelling on pay flat rate to any other small cohort within that million woman for example woman on pension credit or under certain level of income or saving thank the hon lady for her question think we have discuss version of this question before yes there have be model that may have focus on subset of woman for example those on pension credit but that still come up against the fundamental challenge of payment base on some other qualifying condition which in this case be income and not the injustice that have be suffer the ombudsman set out that compensation be due for the injustice not just the virtue of be woman bear in the rise will give way but then will wrap up before madam deputy speaker lose her patience be grateful to the minister for give way again he will be aware that in other compensation scheme there be often wave of compensation the first wave of compensation can be on one indicator with second wave look at other complicate factor have the government look at that model refer the hon lady to our very detailed response which be publish in december it run over number of page so will send she the relevant extract on the conclusion that we have consider interruption will have to conclude now because be test the patience of madam deputy speaker recognise that none of what have say today be likely to change the mind of many member here as the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis have kindly point out to know that not least because see many familiar face from similar debate in westminster hall as the even more friendly right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell have tell the campaigner too be unlikely to be satisfied their tenacity have be clear for all to see and have be attest to sufficiently today they be right to continue to point to the wide context which be that society have be far from universally kind to woman bear in the as they have wrestle with discrimination in the labour market and beyond which be what the hon member for ceredigion preseli ben lake set out early nothing regard the case have set out today diminish any of that however the government have make their decision and we owe it to everybody to be clear about it it be right that hon member hold we to account for it as the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger have set out that have happen today and in other debate in the house include westminster hall as have say before there be lesson for the department to learn and learn they we will we will also continue to support woman bear in the and pensioner generally not least by raise the state pension and turn around our nhs know that they and hon member will expect nothing less want to thank the whole range of colleague who have speak today it have be fantastic collegiate debate that have show the house at its good for those outside of the chamber who be watch the campaign continue it be campaign that bring so many of we together and there be so many formidable campaigner in this chamber who need to be celebrate know that the minister be in difficult position and have lot of time for he as say know that he be bind by the government current position on this issue but want to pick up on some of the information he give in his speech he say that refer to piece of research from but it be actually from and it be research that the ombudsman itself rely on in say that of woman do not know that the state pension age be increase the minister again make the point about letter be ineffective but he must understand that to people watch this debate that be an absurd thing to say know that he say that dwp research state that but the research be absurd and do not really have any basis in reality do not want the minister to go down in history as the man who deny justice for the bear woman honestly do not want to see action on this and want he to go down as the person who finally manage to award these woman justice he have to understand that the argument be put forward by the government be absurd to say the least in fact in deny the ombudsman report the argument be akin to argue that the world be flat it be certainly not an argument that the resolution foundation would have put forward when the minister be director of it the right hon gentleman be right it be not that be why place so much hope in the minister to take action on this to conclude there be two statement make by colleague that stand out for the first be from the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes who say that in the name of decency justice must be do the minister must recognise that so urge he to get round the table with the woman and present package before parliament that we can all support and celebrate as the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell say we be not go to give up until justice be do and neither be the woman question put and agree to resolve that this house note the parliamentary and health service ombudsman phso report on women state pension age hc publish in march which find that maladministration in the department for work and pensions dwp communication about the pensions act result in complainant lose opportunity to make informed decision about some thing and to do some thing differently and diminish their sense of personal autonomy and financial control further note that there will likely be significant number of woman bear in the who have suffer injustice because of maladministration in dwp communication about the pensions act and also note that give the scale of the impact of dwp maladministration and the urgent need for remedy the phso take the rare but necessary step of ask parliament to intervene lay their report before parliament under section of the parliamentary commissioner act and ask parliament to identify mechanism for provide appropriate remedy for those who have suffer injustice phone theft beg to move that this house have consider the matter of mobile phone theft thank the backbench business committee for ensure that we could have this important debate today know that there be many mp who would have love to be here today and who have suffer mobile phone theft ten year ago my bag be steal when be at conference in westminster hotel use geo tracking and see it move slowly over the bridge call the police but they be not interested as say it be year ago somebody at the conference have car and in true starsky and hutch style we use it to chase down the thief we notice as we be travel alongside they that we be probably go to make they very suspicious so we go ahead of they and stop this be probably lot of detail but we then pretend to kiss as the thief walk towards we call the police again to tell they that we be about to apprehend the thief and retrieve my phone the police then arrive and when they jump out of the van we jump out of the car the thief have about mobile phone on they recover my bag and although they have dump my stuff along the way get all my stuff back but the thing be that be year ago and thing have move on people understand that there be find my phone as do the police so we know that we can recover steal phone so now be the time to prioritise this type of theft which be make our street less safe tourist be be target know that the home secretary have have roundtable with mobile phone company and with the mayor of london but if the company will not take this problem as seriously as they should we need to force they to do that by law go to good briefing on the metropolitan police operation reckoning which show its determination this be vital way of achieve the government safe street mission in westminster mobile phone be steal every six minute commend the hon lady on bring forward the debate she be absolutely right but it be about even more than mobile phone be not technically minded own up to that be of different generation but today young person carry on their mobile phone bank detail family thing and personal thing that allow access to account and whatever else sometimes in the back of their phone they have their debit card and their drive licence so when someone get their phone they get almost their whole life as the minister acknowledge in previous debate perhaps today young person need to understand that if they lose that they lose almost everything financially thank the hon member for that important intervention he be absolutely right mobile phone be not just for make phone call anymore it be an integral part of most people life it hold datum on it as well as picture that its owner will never be able to take again it hold voicemail from love one my friend who have her phone snatch in egypt have voicemail from her late mother on her phone mobile phone hold so much information that when someone snatch one they be snatch part of that person life far to the intervention from the hon member for strangford jim shannon do my hon friend agree that public awareness be not where it should be it worry to see people with their phone stick out of their back pocket or people stand and take photograph around westminster know how high the incidence of theft be somehow the public need to be more aware and more careful with these precious thing that hold so much of their life on they thank my hon friend for that important intervention that be the thing until we ensure that our street be safe we must ensure that people be acutely aware of what be happen find myself sometimes tap people on the shoulder and say excuse can you move your phone from your back pocket you might get pickpockete feel that the manufacturer use this as part of their business model they know that once phone get steal its owner will go and buy another phone and phone currently operate on monopoly do not know if anybody have ever try to switch from an iphone to samsung as do oh my goodness it be like they do not want you to switch over even from android to android it be difficult to move over the datum mobile phone company know exactly what they be do thank god for usb cs because iphone charger use to change with every upgrade so people end up fork out more and more money we need to hold the manufacturer to account because they make enough money and enough profit we have to get to stage where we be put people and the safety of our citizen first london be one of the great city on earth and we want tories to come not tories but tourist laughter tory be obviously welcome too even though they be not here today we want tourist to come to london to sample the art the culture and the inclusion we do not want to go around warn they about their mobile phone over phone be also steal from departments so the government should have vested interest in this because it will cost taxpayer money to replace those phone we can redesign mobile phone so that nobody want to steal they do not know if people be old enough to remember although there be few in the chamber today when car radio use to be steal out of car we combat and stop that crime by build the radio into the car so they could not easily be snatch out just want to throw something else at the debate around the insurance issue many say you should be cover by insurance my phone be steal last november it be classic get bump into in big crowd and do not realise then recognise the theft and do find my phone it be in north london so contact the police but they do not investigate after an hour because they say it be go say have the personal number of the whole of the cabinet there so that might cause bit of problem then claim on the household insurance and be cover but then the insurance company would not renew my cover that just add to the problem all the way through everyone seem to be make profit out of it apart from we be impressed that my right hon friend have the all the cabinet phone number he be absolutely right the knock on effect of this crime be huge whether it be the house insurance the personal stuff or the global crime syndicate it be huge watch documentary by dave fishwick know through bank of dave he speak to one of the gang leader and they talk about shoulder surfing where they like to watch people and get the detail of their phone they like to get phone when they be already open so that they can then scrape all the datum and bank detail within that hour as my right hon friend say they could empty out someone bank account around people be also victim of identity theft in this country every single day this crime therefore be not simply about nick somebody phone it go lot deep than that one hundred million second hand phone go to china and some go to algeria too apple and google say that they will reconnect phone that have be report steal we should say to they that that admission in itself be unacceptable china have become an illegal electronic recycling hub where if they can not get into phone they dismantle it and build new phone use various part from steal one those who do not disconnect their id straightaway be send threaten message that talk about kill and rap family member with some even send video of gun that say they be come to kill they that be terribly frightening and also why we need to stop this global crime now there be link between neighbourhood crime and organised criminality criminal think that the police do not care about mobile phone theft because it be just mobile phone and people can claim it back be glad that the met police be take this seriously unlike year ago doubt that many head of criminal organisation will be watch this debate but note that people be arrest in january through operation reckoning on average people be get sentence of four to five year which think be right because this be not crime without consequence the government have huge role to play in make sure that we say to these criminal that we be serious about hold they to account however we must also say to the manufacture company that if they will not provide kill switch for steal mobile phone we will force they to do it by law rise order plan to start the wind up at around pm congratulate and thank the hon member for brent east dawn butler for bring this important debate rise to support she and to bring urgent attention to an issue that continue to disrupt life not just across the uk but in my constituency the rise tide of mobile phone theft this be not petty crime or just about the loss of device this be about identity theft financial vulnerability and in many case the complete disconnection of some of the most vulnerable people in our community from the service they rely on every day the number for the last two year speak volume between december and november west yorkshire police record over mobile phone theft in dewsbury and batley in and the following year on average more than people in my constituency fall victim to this specific crime every single month and that be just what be record we know full well the real figure be likely high many do not report these crime believe that the police have more serious matter to attend to or that nothing can be do as the hon member say mobile phone theft be serious these be not just communication tool they be bank medical record job application childcare arrangement emergency lifeline and priceless memory read about constituent single mother in dewsbury moor whose phone be steal while shop it be not just the phone she lose she miss three job interview could not access her new universal credit account and have her personal photo and private medical record compromise that be not an isolated story mobile phone theft be systemic threat to digital safety and personal dignity nationally hundred of thousand of mobile phone be steal annually and many of those device end up in highly organise criminal supply chain some be export other be wipe and sell locally in some case victim be follow or even assault for their device what be bad be that recovery and prosecution rate remain disturbingly low across many police force less than of mobile phone theft result in charge what must we do first we need to treat mobile phone theft as organised crime not petty theft the link between phone theft fraud and even violent crime be well establish police force must be resource and mandate to treat it with the seriousness it deserve secondly we need strong action from telecom provider and tech company why be some phone still so easy to wipe clean and resell on that very topic the science innovation and technology committee have an inquiry where we put this to apple and google it turn out that phone that be report steal in this country go on something call the gsma blacklist which stop the hardware from work and the phone can not be reuse in this country the police say that most steal phone go abroad to network that do not use that blacklist put it to apple and google that they could use this blacklist they say yes they could but no they do not want to do the hon member agree that these company should enable that blacklist which would in my humble opinion effectively stop the theft of phone on the street of london thank the hon member for his informed contribution to the debate agree with he and the hon member for brent east who indicate that company be not do enough it should be easy to disable phone so they be beyond use both in this country and abroad and so the only value they have would be in the spare part they contain we need strong action from telecom provider and tech company they must put the protection of their customer datum above profit from their customer have to buy the same or similar replacement why be some phone easy to wipe and resell why be track system so easy to disable the government must act to force company to make tracking system strong and less easy to disable thirdly we must support local policing in dewsbury and batley neighbourhood police team be overstretch try to deal with phone snatching shoplifting and antisocial behaviour with limited boot on the ground they deserve the tool the people and the political will behind they to make our street safe finally we must support victim many can not afford to replace their phone or reclaim their digital identity without support let we explore emergency tech fund or digital safety grant for vulnerable individual and family we live in digital world in which steal someone phone be tantamount to steal their identity their access to society and for some their only link to help we must not stand by while our constituent be target their privacy violate and their future interrupt let we act not just with concern but with conviction thank my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler for secure this important and timely debate seventeen year ago be young hutch to her starsky as parliamentary staffer in the then constituency of brent central so it be nice to speak in her debate today those of we who have have our mobile phone steal know how hopeless you can feel and how intrusive it can be we know it be not victimless crime have have my phone steal as have my husband it can happen in second leave you suddenly vulnerable as you go about your daily life for woman walk alone late at night

whatsapp we might not want to be see in this day and age have your phone steal feel like your whole life be suddenly at risk of be crack open and violate know that horrible feeling and so do my constituent thomas who contact after he see bbc article in which discuss my own experience thomas do not just have his phone steal thief gain access to his wallet and online banking and take out huge loan in his name which cause he massive anxiety over christmas despite clear evidence of fraud it be only when intervene as his member of parliament that his bank allow he to recover his money thomas

westfield each week stratford have become phone theft hotspot cynthia and andrew write to deeply concerned about the rise in bike enable phone snatch and the anxiety this have cause in their neighbourhood bike be key enabler of mobile phone theft this week we hold asb forum in redbridge and waltham forest we hear about the great work be do by councillor jo blackman to address the problem of illegally adapt bike simple measure we could implement such as end the off road sale loophole would have real impact on our constituent affect by phone theft and other crime do my hon friend agree that we must look at the regulation and enforcement around bike which can be adapt to go at dangerously fast speed and so enable this sort of crime agree with my hon and gallant friend he make an important point and be sure the minister will respond to it want to mention few other constituent experience jade contact to share her shock at witness mother have her phone snatch while she be try to buy shoe for her son matthew tell his partner be leave feel unsafe walk their dog at night after be accost by thief on his way home those be not isolate incident they be part of wide and troubling trend we in this chamber know that it be happen across our constituency and it be one that leave people feel fearful in their own neighbourhood as they go about their daily life make no mistake conservative members who be not here in great number today should look seriously at their record in the final year of the previous government street crime rise by over and mobile phone theft soar it do not have to be this way with properly fund and resource police and community service we can fight back mention the footfall at stratford station have see at first hand what be be do to tackle this issue there police taskforce launch target operation with officer disrupt theft and arrest phone snatcher british transport police recently have similar operation this labour government be take action crack down on the thief and thug and take back control of our high street town centre and shopping centre we be back up police with strong power to tackle mobile phone theft in the crime and policing bill and we be call on tech company to design out the ability of thief to re sell steal phone crucially we be strengthen neighbourhood police to restore public confidence that if person report their phone as steal someone will actually do something about it in london we be work with mayor sadiq khan who know be personally commit to drive down these figure phone theft be not petty crime and it be not victimless crime it can happen in second but the impact be long lasting it can rob people of cherish memory store on their phone it can drain bank account in second as my constituent matthew put it what way be that to live afraid to walk your dog in your own neighbourhood we owe it to he and everyone affect to make our street safe will join members here today in do all we can to root it out but we must also compel phone manufacturer to remove the incentive because we can not arrest our way out of this problem every layer of this chain must take it seriously call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the hon member for brent east dawn butler for secure this debate and the backbench business committee for grant it along with the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed and for stratford and bow uma kumaran she speak eloquently of the emotional impact of steal phone still have nokia but that be another issue phone be far more than just something we can send text message on or make call it be where we store our memory where many people find romance and where we access critical service as the hon member for dewsbury and batley say it be so much more and that be why the impact of steal phone be very significant and far more disruptive than it would have be year ago member have highlight the important role that tech company and phone company need to play in prevent and mitigate phone theft they also highlight how the lack of police resource can sometimes mean lack of immediate police interest or need to improve police process we must make sure that our police be support so that they can help people who be victim of this crime any form of crime can leave we feel vulnerable be once burgle very little be take but nevertheless the sense of worry and the fact that it could happen again stay with we and prey on the mind particularly when by oneself late in the evening that manifest itself here as well as anywhere else the hon member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey make an important point about the role that illegal bike play in this crime commend to member recent report by the all party parliamentary group for cycling and walk about the issue of illegal bike which outline number of step that could be take to well regulate they and deal with that problem government policy be that police will be able to search property without warrant for steal phone or other electronically geotagge item under measure in the crime and policing bill clearly as we have hear this afternoon more need to be do to stop the tidal wave of mobile phone theft it be right that the government be take step in that direction but if they be really serious about stop mobile phone theft they must also restore proper community policing where officer have the time and resource to focus on their local neighbourhood everyone deserve to feel safe in their own home and walk down their own street but for too many people in the uk today that be simply not the reality the conservatives unnecessary cut have leave our police force overstretch under resource and unable to focus on the crime that affect our community the most every be sure the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy know how to make an intervention if he would like to do so rather than speak from sedentary position he have be in the house some time every day case be close by the police across england and wales without suspect even be identify and just of crime be report to the police and result in suspect be charge that be partly because the conservatives slash the number of police community support officer by more than after when they be in government by themselves and with decisive majority in most instance there be significant public concern about the prevalence of mobile phone theft particularly snatch theft as we have hear in this debate where perpetrator on bike and moped steal mobile phone from people hand often in busy urban area the exact offence link to the theft of phone will depend upon the particular circumstance of the case such as where the phone be take on the street or from inside someone home and whether force be use but we know from the crime survey for england and wales that an estimate people have phone or bag snatch from they on the street in the year end march that be equivalent to snatch theft day and be increase on the number of incident in the year end march london be regard as the epicentre of phone theft with million worth of phone report steal in london in the national crime agency say that steal phone be dispose of overseas in china dubai algeria and many other country and suggest that some offender will access datum contain within app on steal mobile phone in order to commit additional offence such as theft from bank account report publish by the mail online and the times state that organise crime group pay people up to per phone that they steal show the complexity of the crime we be try to tackle and its link to other form of crime those organise crime group ship steal phone overseas where they be sell on or break down into part that can be sell or use for repair it have be suggest that china be the preferred destination for steal handset since china unlike the uk the european union and many other country be not member of the central equipment identity register global database that mobile network use to block steal device the government be take some welcome step on this issue as part of their safe street mission they be work to crack down on theft and other crime that make people feel unsafe in our community include strengthen neighbourhood policing and restore public confidence the safe street mission include neighbourhood policing guarantee each neighbourhood will have name contactable officer to tackle the issue face their community include dedicated team who will spend their time on the beat with guarantee police patrol in town centre and other hotspot area at peak time central to that guarantee be the government commitment to put additional police officer pcso and special constable into neighbourhood policing role the government aim to have the additional in place by in february the home secretary host mobile phone theft summit to drive new action to tackle mobile phone theft and secure collective effort to grip this criminality the summit attend by police leader the national crime agency the mayor of london and tech company discuss way to break the business model of mobile thief the home secretary urge all in attendance to join force to help to design out and disincentivise phone theft by make phone effectively worthless to criminal it be agree that the mobile phone theft summit would reconvene in three month time but we have not yet see any public record of the summit meeting again as hon member have say there be an important role here for the tech industry while some company such as apple and google offer tool to lock locate and wipe device remotely and require identity verification there be lot more that they must do to ensure that this crime be deal with in conclusion lose phone be more than just lose bit of technology our phone have now become intrinsic to most of our life and many people be unable to pay for thing without their phone that be why it be important that we have debate this issue and that the government continue with their effort to tackle it look forward to hear from the minister it should go without say that law and order be the bedrock of healthy society but law that we make in this house be only worth anything if they be enforce in britain today this be all too often the story widen gulf between our law and how they be actually apply can think of few well example than mobile phone theft there be temptation to think of phone theft as an example of petty crime but it sound as though we in this house all agree that there be nothing petty about it mobile phone be link to our friend and family and for many people they be necessary tool for work study and day to day life they often hold sensitive information both personal and financial to say nothing of the intimidation and violence experience by victim and the corrosive impact that rampant phone theft have on our public realm so when we think about phone theft we should not just be think about the inconvenience of miss phone we should be think about the distress to victim and the creep sense that increasingly we be no long safe in public to capture the scale of the problem it be useful to reflect on the datum accord to last year crime survey for england and wales snatch theft of mobile phone and bag rise by last year reach year high overall theft stand at the high rate for decade accord to the office for national statistics at the epicentre of this crime wave be london where theft have more than double over the past five year three quarter of phone theft take place there with phone steal last year alone those device have street value of more than million phone theft often contribute to other form of crime accord to commander james conway of the metropolitan police about of london knife crime be link to theft mean that the increase in phone theft be likely to be contribute to the city rampant knife crime epidemic cyber security expert have also warn that phone steal in london be be ship off to country like china where they be often use in international organise crime perhaps that should not come as surprise give the approach take by sadiq khan london labour mayor he be focus on crack down on stop and search which be clearly prove to cut crime while his police and crime plan barely mention phone theft focus on introduce new regulation for phone company instead of stop actual crime of course technology company should do their bit where they reasonably can but our focus should be on catch and imprison criminal in the vast majority of the case the report crime be not solve the phone be not retrieve and the offender be not arrest leave they to walk free to commit more crime that be simply not acceptable and we should not accept it all the while police force across the country spend an estimate hour per year on non crime hate incident collect and store datum on speech that might be perceive to be offensive be it any wonder that many people be begin to describe the state of modern britain as anarcho tyranny more rule apply more strictly for the law abide majority while actual criminal walk free while many police officer work hard and genuinely wish to make our country safe place the system and incentive that govern their activity be totally broken it be simply wrong that resource be spend on police speech while prolific thief run rampant through our street phone theft be not the only crime like that for too many people in britain particularly in our large city low level disorder be now the unpleasant mood music of their day to day life we all feel the decline in our public realm and it make our country bad place to live speak to any member of the british public and they will be able to tell we exactly what to do spend less time on police speech and more time on catch thief give police force the tool they need to tackle these crime and when we catch career criminal ensure they serve proper prison sentence in short enforce the law congratulate my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler on secure the debate and thank the backbench business committee for allocate the time be very grateful to my hon friend for share her experience particularly the starsky and hutch approach that she take to try to recover her mobile phone when it be steal year ago be grateful to all member of the house who have make contribution in the limited time that we have have available we have have an important discussion span many different area both geographically and topically the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed speak about the experience in west yorkshire my hon friend the member for stratford and bow uma kumaran talk about the interchange at stratford station and along with my hon and gallant friend the member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey talk about the problem with bike as enablers of mobile phone theft want to be very clear this government be absolutely determined to address the menace of mobile phone theft say to the shadow minister the hon member for weald of kent katie lam that the unfortunate truth be that by the time this government take office this type of criminality have become so common that it be essentially feature of daily life in some area and the statistic bear that out she talk about the policing of speech and lock criminal up but she need to reflect on the record of the conservative government they introduce the non crime hate incident guidance under the previous policing minister the right hon member for croydon south chris philp who be now the shadow home secretary and fail the prison system by not build enough prison place this government be have to deal with that will the minister give way no time be very short the hon gentleman record when he be special advisor in the home office really be nothing to be proud of will talk about the statistic street theft increase by more than in the last year of the previous government drive largely by soar rate of snatch theft involve mobile phone while we be start to see some promising reduction include decrease in the number of mobile phone theft by force or threat of force in the capital level of mobile phone theft sadly remain intolerably high which be totally unacceptable we recognise that the impact of this criminality go beyond the loss of mobile phone costly and stressful though that undoubtedly be it undermine people sense of personal safety and security in the most insidious way it snatch part of people life as my hon friend the member for brent east say include bank detail personal record and precious memory store on phone decent law abide people deserve much much well which be why the prime minister have place safe street at the heart of his plan for change through that mission we be take decisive action to restore law and order to our town centre and high street and the scourge of mobile phone theft be very much in our sight it may be helpful if set out for the house some of the key step we be take to combat this crime it have be clear throughout the debate that we accept that if we be to drive the real change we need to see we need to work effectively with tech company the police and other in civil society both to prevent theft from happen and to well detect the perpetrator when theft occur in that spirit the home secretary chair very productive summit in february bring together representative from the police include the metropolitan police the national crime agency the mayor of london local government leader lead technology company and other sector to push for much strong collaboration in this space have be work closely with stakeholder from industry and law enforcement on this important topic so be pleased to see the summit result in clear commitment from attendee to work in partnership and to significantly boost the sharing of datum and intelligence on mobile phone theft so that we can build comprehensive picture of the problem and well understand the role of organise criminal network ultimately our aim be to disrupt design out and disincentivise mobile phone theft official be work closely with law enforcement partner tech company and other industry representative to deliver practical and effective measure so that we can crack down on these crime my hon friend the member for brent east talk particularly about mobile phone theft in london which be particular hotspot that be why the metropolitan police be an important partner in the collective effort to tackle this form of crime we welcome the two recent period of intensification of activity by the metropolitan police which together result in more than arrest link to mobile phone theft we will hold second summit in the next few week to reflect on the progress make and to galvanise cross sector agreement on the ambitious outcome that we all want there remain long road ahead but be really hopeful that the tech company and the wide stakeholder will come to the table with bold proposal to be very clear the government will not hesitate to take more decisive action if the summit do not result in clear commitment to tackle this issue include consider further legislation and regulation to radically reduce this and related criminality draw member attention to the fact that the crime and policing bill introduce new power to help police recover steal mobile phone more quickly it allow officer to enter and search premise to which steal device have be electronically track in situation in which it be not practicable to obtain warrant this will allow the police to act swiftly and will increase the likelihood that criminal will be catch and punish we welcome the innovative step already take by tech company to tackle mobile phone theft it be crucial that we now deepen collaboration between those company and law enforcement that be how we will ensure that anti theft feature can not be bypass by criminal and that the technology support police investigation and the recovery of steal phone while anti theft feature be vital to ensure the safety of mobile phone we acknowledge that some technology can be misuse by bad actor particularly in case of domestic abuse that be why we be work with tech company to ensure that new solution be safe and proportionate and do not inadvertently put victim at risk this be about make steal phone worthless without create new vulnerability during this debate several proposal have be put forward for how we might strengthen our collective response to mobile phone theft have hear they all and be grateful for all of they while we will of course keep our approach under review we be focus on deliver our plan to reduce mobile phone theft in partnership with law enforcement technology company and service provider the government be work with those tech company to ensure that people phone be protect through work group establish by the home office and attend by technology company and police partner we aim to ensure that everything possible be do to disincentivise phone theft by make steal phone effectively worthless to criminal conclude by again offer my thank to my hon friend the member for brent east for secure this debate and to all the member who have contribute hope that in the limited time available have address some of the point discuss this afternoon in essence this issue be as much about people as it be about policy and power we must always remember that behind the statistic be thousand and thousand of real victim who have suffer the shock and distress as well as the inconvenience and disruption of have their device snatch our high street and town centre be fill with people go about their everyday life as they make their way from place to place there should be no question but that they be safe and that their belonging be secure the notion that they might be pounce upon by thief at any moment be simply unacceptable and this government will not tolerate it our message be clear britain street belong to the law abide majority not to thief and mugger and we will do whatever it take to protect the public from those callous and harmful crime be in the middle of writing we all know what the issue and problem be and then the shadow minister the hon member for weald of kent katie lam start speak thank the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed for his contribution include his mention of universal credit we have start encourage people to do everything online so when their phone get take away all of that also get take away also thank my partner in crime my hon friend the member for stratford and bow uma kumaran will not tell you about any of the adventure we have be on madam deputy speaker stratford be very busy centre and attract lot of crime so it be important that we get this right she also mention our mayor of london sadiq khan and all the work he be do on this issue thank my hon friend the member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey for the intervention he make on the issue of bike that have be illegally hack so that they go fast generally there be two rider on the back one steer they in and the other take the phone this be problem that we have to get to grip with as my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend mary glindon and the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell say at the end of the day we need to get to the bottom of this because it be not petty crime but huge crime that affect our street the shadow minister completely miss the point but as she speak about free speech let say this when the police arrest the last person who call the word and other racist slur they thank for take far right extremist off the street because that person be not on their radar and the police be shake the shadow minister may want to hold protective shield over those who be racist sexist misogynistic and homophobic but we do not all can say be thank goodness the conservatives be no long in power question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the matter of mobile phone theft gravesham river crossings motion make and question propose that this house do now mather thank you madam deputy speaker for this opportunity to come to the house to discuss the importance of river crossing in my constituency of gravesham be grateful to the minister for give up his time today to respond to the debate wish to cover two crossing one old and closed which be the gravesend to tilbury ferry and one planned and very expensive which be the low thames crossing for those who do not know gravesham constituency be river community we be bind by the river thames with all its history just as we member be here in the house and we be only mile apart for much of the history of the borough there have be river crossing certainly since roman time accord to one esteemed local historian christoph bull the right of long ferry be exclusively give to gravesend waterman to provide river service to and from london this be bit of history lesson but that be confirm by the king in in charter the aim be to help rebuild the town after fire in since then there have be river crossing in place between the constituency of my hon friend the member for thurrock jen craft and mine it have connect the two ancient kingdom of kent and essex for eon enable travel for trade leisure and tourism today the port of london authority which control all travel of boat up and down the thames be base in my constituency and pay tribute to it the royal national lifeboat institution have base on the river in gravesend and know that the house would want to extend our thank to it for the work it do across the country the people of gravesham and of my hon friend constituency of thurrock be river people many family include mine have link to the river my late father in law trevor mochrie be gravesend tug seaman who work on the river early in his career before work on the high sea as the river be the main artery to and from london gravesham be and be strong on industry and it be source of employment in tourism and leisure in particular we have our gravesend regatta which be celebrate year it be run before that but it be make official year ago by the council because of some very unparliamentary dispute that take place about who win race place on record my tribute to the committee its chair shane cleaver and all the volunteer for keep this tradition go in sportsmanlike fashion and there have be no further dispute of that kind give that extensive local history and heritage it be to our dismay and that of resident business and visitor from thurrock and gravesend that thurrock council and kent county council cease fund the gravesend tilbury ferry service last year since the ending of that service local business have suffer significantly they have tell that it have impact on people ability to get to and from work and that they have lose many people who can not bear the thought of take the dartford crossing in order to get to work on our high street one particular business marie tea room which use to cater for the pass trade from the large cruise ship that use to dock at tilbury have be impact to the point that it can no long employ member of staff these thing have impact and be sure it be the same across our high street have be run petition as have my hon friend the member for thurrock and there have be other our petition have garner thousand of signature motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now mather our petition which have garner thousand of signature call for the return of the ferry service it be clear that business and resident want their ferry back at present there be desire for people to travel by public transport which support people should leave their car at home but they need option previously the option be minute jump across the water now the option be train into london and back out again or multiple bus to get through the dartford crossing all this be cost we precious time if we as society want to support public transport relieve congestion on the road should be at the heart of everything we do take the example of the woolwich ferry which by parliamentary statute must be run and be not able to charge be not ask tempt as it be for that to be the case for the gravesend tilbury ferry but be ask the local authority to protect these valuable transport route in the last year we have see two new public transport option that my constituent in bexleyheath and crayford benefit from when cross the river the dockland light railway in woolwich and the elizabeth line into abbey wood but as my hon friend have say there be no public transport option from woolwich to the kent coast that she and my constituent can benefit from will she join in welcome some exploration of river and other public transport option through south east london and into kent absolutely agree the thames clipper be remarkable service that be support by transport for london but it need to be subsidise it be look at expand into the estuary take on board the desire of my hon friend constituent and mine to be able to travel via the river think that be very good proposal that we in this place should get behind know from my past role as councillor on gravesham borough council that operator be very interested in introduce ferry service in fact gravesend pier be sell to thames clipper in order to make way for the exciting development of the new public transport route to london and beyond however gravesham borough council be not local highway authority so it have neither the status nor the money to develop this kind of public transport and hold the contract give the local government reorganisation that be come the council be prepared to do it but it can not be leave with no money because that would be poor financial management the ferry service could be public private partnership if business be listen perhaps we can come together with the government and fund it through money that go down to local authority will speak briefly about the low thames crossing which may not be the solution or the silver bullet it sit within gravesham and go through the constituency of my hon friend the member for thurrock it be fair to say that we have be vocally opposed to it since the outset particularly because of its significant impact on gravesham quite rightly labour have promise that local resident will see the benefit of major infrastructure project and it be in this vein that will ask the minister some question which hope he will be able to follow up would welcome private meeting if need to go through this issue with his department for transport colleague the low thames crossing will have an impact on gravesham option be choose nearly decade ago under the tories it be the most expensive option compare with another bridge at dartford do regret the loss of ancient woodland the impact on air quality and the congestion of our local road the conservatives take dither and delay approach therefore while new bridge could have already be build have it be fund we be still wait resident of northfleet gravesend and the village along the in my constituency already suffer with congestion and gridlock when the dartford crossing go down or when the which be huge arterial road into london have problem gravesham and gravesend will be cut in half yet sandwich between the dartford crossing and the propose low thames crossing the modelling datum from national highways show that congestion level will be back to what they be now within four year of the opening of the low thames crossing resident be worried about get to dare not valley hospital for urgent care when these problem occur on our road at peak time or sadly when there be accident give people choice of reliable public transport option would ease that congestion if there be reliable public transport option bus river boat river ferry to take car off the road there would be great capacity on the road for when such unfortunate congestion event occur the wide impact of the tunnel need to be consider currently we fear that the will be use as rat run to access the when the original plan for the low thames crossing be think of there be go to be an upgrade at bluebell hill sadly under the conservatives that be cut back and then cut back far unless that junction be improve sadly the village in my constituency will be bear the brunt of the hugely increase number of vehicle travel to the would like some assurance about the low thames crossing and have some question to which would like answer in the day to come how will national highways ensure that the year of construction and of delay will minimally impact gravesham resident how will the traffic get to and from the low thames crossing without impact local road indeed there be talk of use the river for bring in equipment and material what power exist to ensure that local road be not use as rat run and who will be hold accountable for that our local infrastructure such as housing will be impact by the influx of worker we would like halt on people work on the low thames crossing move into the area because we already face significant housing crisis in the area other thing that could be affect include leisure and health service so will such wide infrastructure project be increase in the future what accountability be there for the modelling datum as have say four year on and the congestion will be at the same level which will have wide impact local resident have raise that concern with but who can hold accountable we be all local mp and it be right that we ask the tough question and make request for our constituency so kindly request the minister to look at restore the gravesend to tilbury ferry and sustainably maintain in perpetuity as decent public transport option and it could be subsidise and promote from small proportion of the toll on the low thames crossing we want guarantee with accountability that gravesend business and resident be at the front and centre of the new job we have deprive ward in gravesham which be among the top most deprive area and we want those people to have access to such skill hope member understand that gravesham and thurrock will be most impact by this programme it be only right that those resident see some of the benefit especially as at the moment local be consider to be local resident or local person who be employ within mile radius now that be half of london ask that we capture that information from five mile radius be not say all of it should be local but we need to ensure that local people and business be encourage to apply and take up those job on the mitigation and accountability for the rat running that will ensue on the base on the wide road modelling there be the issue of propose toll we be directly opposite the large unitary authority of thurrock the resident of thurrock enjoy resident discount scheme in gravesham however such scheme have not be promote yet very many of my resident use the dartford crossing on regular basis especially now that the tilbury crossing be down therefore ask the minister if gravesham could be include in the dartford crossing scheme while the low thames crossing be be build and thereafter in perpetuity want to raise mitigation for the environmental impact we know the terrible air quality in dartford and we do not want that in gravesham how can we improve both place and protect gravesham resident finally on housing vast array of our land that could have be develop for housing be now no long available in conclusion thank the minister in advance for his upcoming reply and to you madam deputy speaker for this adjournment debate most of all would like to thank the resident business and visitor of gravesham gravesham have long history on the river and we would really like to see the return of the gravesend tilbury ferry crossing thank my hon friend the member for gravesham dr sullivan for secure this debate we call each other our sister across the river as we be separate by small stretch of the river thames want to very briefly add my contribution on the importance of the tilbury ferry as we call it on my side of the river my hon friend have speak at length about the history of the tilbury ferry and it do have long and proud history we always refer to it as have be grant to we by henry viii it run continuously for the good part of year until bankruptcy by tory council in thurrock take it out be really determined to see its return the ferry be personal and special for have many childhood memory of take the tilbury ferry across the river to gravesend to spend delightful day on my hon friend side of the river go to the cafe and there be lovely shop that sell boardgame in case hon member can not tell have penchant for geekery and boardgame be very much up my alley there be lovely pub call the three daws where have spend many happy time sadly we be no long able to visit because it would mean minute to an hour trip over the dartford crossing and around indeed there be congestion daily on the dartford crossing when there be more severe issue as there be today my husband ring to say he have to get my daughter from school as her bus can not pick she up due to traffic backing up right into my constituency it be huge issue for we many of my constituent will tonight be sit about minute from their house unable to get there because of the issue with congestion clearly that need to be address my hon friend speak eloquently about why we do not feel that the low thames crossing be necessarily the way to answer the problem of congestion but would like to add my voice to say that the tilbury ferry provide public transport alternative to use the road that be the direction of travel we should be look at make public transport open accessible and easy to use when the minister rise he may say that the government be not in the habit of funding boat and river service my answer would be that we should perhaps explore the art of the possible and look at what it be possible to do and how we can restore this service the ferry be not only something wonderful cultural and historic it be actually key part of public transport infrastructure in my part of the world we share lot of health service so people would take the ferry over the river for that use to see my orthodontist in gravesend when be teenager which be something look forward to less than day trip out and visit the cafés shall we say however it be important some of my constituent commute over to go to the grammar school in kent we also have quite lot of people who take the river to travel to work understand that the port of london actually put on small boat for their staff who live either side of the river indeed my brother live for time over the river just short hop on the ferry away again that be no long possible it be really quite upsetting and sad for lot of we within about week of start petition to try to bring back the tilbury ferry have receive signature it now stand at little over thousand we ask people to share their memory and share why they want to bring the ferry back if we be look at someone come on board potential private partner we want to show that there be an appetite for the ferry and that it will be use because it be always use there be never an empty ferry when it be run it be always busy throughout the day any day of the week that it be run people have share thing like want to go on the ferry one more time before they die thing that be really quite move they have share memory of take their grandchild and great grandchild on it and go on day trip out as well as travel for work someone say we do have lot of nice thing in our part of the world the thing that we do have we want to keep and the thing that we do have we want back it be absolutely delightful coincidentally the tilbury ferry be exactly the right amount of time that any child can spend on boat before go mad and get bored five minute they see the boat get on the boat and be excited then they want to leave the boat but by then the boat be at gravesend brilliant it be fantastic day out my plea to the minister be to consider what my hon friend the member for gravesham have say particularly in relation to use some of the money that will be generate by the low thames crossing minuscule proportion could fund the running of this service in perpetuity it would alleviate that congestion the congestion that will still exist after about five year of the low thames crossing operation in the meantime the government should look at other way to support the return of this absolutely vital crucial service for my constituent and those of my hon friend thank my hon friend the member for gravesham dr sullivan for secure this important adjournment debate on the impact of river crossing on her gravesham constituency she say that the charter for the river and her town be from think it be henry iv have take over from richard ii the whole shakespeare play be about rebellion and feel rebellion on the back benches at the moment because of how important this subject be to both my hon friend the members for gravesham and for thurrock jen craft my hon friend the member for gravesham have be true champion in this field she have make number of representation to as she have mention and to other ministerial colleague call for the reinstatement of the gravesend tilbury ferry service which end in march due to lack of funding appreciate the effort and passion that my hon friend and her sister across the river my hon friend the member for thurrock fearsome sister would say have display in support these service which can provide quick link between kent and essex across the thames estuary in particular provide an alternative when there be problem on the dartford crossing as have be point out recognise that the ferry provide useful link across the estuary and be very popular with regular user it be particularly useful to those travel to their respective workplace and provide an alternative to car journey via dartford as my hon friend well know there be number of key industry and employment site in north kent and south essex that play an important role in both regional and national economy we know that the thames gateway be go to be massive driver for economic growth in the uk with both the amazon plant and cldn there we have other ambition for the estuary in term of become clean energy superpower and drive growth in the maritime sector thank my hon friend for their work with the maritime sector as it affect their constituency be sure that they will acknowledge that ferry service run on private sector basis to meet commercial demand any decision to provide funding for local ferry service be ultimately matter for local partner where local ferry service form part of local transport option it be for the local transport authority to consider such decision in line with devolution it be for local authority to decide their transport priority and where to allocate budget there have be successful example of ferry service receive local funding include mersey ferries in liverpool and woolwich ferry in london which be both fund and operate by the local transport authority to support local transport authority the government have be clear on their transport priority with capital funding to support local bus service improvement to active travel and the maintenance of local road on that specific point my hon friend and have ask in the past whether it would be possible to use some of the bus funding which have receive an uplift to fund the tilbury ferry the answer have be that it would not be possible because it be not bus it be fairly obvious that it be not bus will the minister perhaps consider reclassify the tilbury ferry as river bus no we can not use those money in that way but that do not stop we talk in the future with department official and the private sector about the river to see what be the art of the possible let we hold that in abeyance and will say little more about that at the end of my speech the government be explore all viable funding option for the low thames crossing that include private finance option which would use public seed funding to unlock investment road user charge will help finance the low thames crossing and reduce the burden on the public purse for major infrastructure project the road user charge regime for the low thames crossing have not be set so urge my hon friend to make their representation to the secretary of state the roads minister and on this matter as it pertain to their local constituency when we consider the private company and contractor that may come forward the ask here be whether we could extract social value social good from the funding for the tilbury gravesend crossing recently meet the chief executive of thames clippers which think own the pier and that model have be pursue in other part of the country so again it be worthy of exploration with and my official across the financial period the department have allocate kent county council nearly million to support its local highway network over million to support the improvement of bus service and million to support active travel improvement that be significant uplift under this government in the same financial period the department have allocate thurrock council nearly million to support its local highway network million to support the improvement of bus service and over to support active travel improvement in addition the chancellor recently confirm in the spending review that the bus fare cap which be expect to finish at the end of the year will be extend until at least march benefit both local authority however there be limited revenue funding for the local authority and it will be for they to decide which service to prioritise urge all partner in the region and the members of parliament who have speak eloquently here today to work together constructively to find appropriate local transport solution include river service have ask my official at the department for transport to work closely with local partner to identify any funding opportunity that could become available to help support local plan say to my hon friend the member for thurrock that hope one day she will be able to visit the three daws public house once again thank my hon friend the member for gravesham for secure this adjournment debate and for be doughty champion on this matter in her constituency question put and agree to house adjourn
