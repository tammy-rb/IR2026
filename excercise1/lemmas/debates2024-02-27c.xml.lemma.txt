speaker statement before we begin today proceeding should like to express my sadness on behalf of the house at the death of two former member ronnie campbell serve as member for blyth valley from to he be kind and generous man well like in all part of the house and powerful advocate for his constituent and his principle there be also the tragic news of the death of lord cormack who be member of this house for year from to he be an eminent historian of parliament as well as editor and then president of the house magazine they be two very different character who be unite by strong duty to their constituent and firm commitment to their principle they each make their mark on this house in their own way and we will miss they very much be sure the thought of the whole house be with their family and friend oral answers to questions energy security and net zero the secretary of state be ask social energy tariff what recent assessment her department have make of the potential merit of introduce social energy tariff what recent assessment her department have make of the potential merit of introduce social energy tariff energy price be now at their low level for two year with typical bill set to drop by by april our cost of live package total over billion or per household on average over to we be support those most in need with million of vulnerable household receive up to in cost of living payment some of we believe in preventative spending house of commons library briefing last year estimate that the annual cost to the national health service of treat illness associate with live in cold or damp housing be billion when wide societal cost be consider that figure rise to billion will the secretary of state confirm whether the introduction of social energy tariff would cost less than billion social tariff mean lot of thing to different people but we be support vulnerable people with the cost of their energy bill we support they last winter pay on average half of everybody energy bill and we have make additional payment of to support people since we have increase the proportion of home that be energy efficient and insulate to up from call chris law not here on energy tariff what assessment have the secretary of state make of the merit of provide resident who be local to energy and nuclear plant with discount on their energy bill thank my hon friend for her doughty campaigning for nuclear she be our very own atomic kitten we be very positive about nuclear and have set out plan for the large expansion of nuclear for year overall that will be good thing for people energy bill and the energy security of this country fuel poverty what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter what step she be take to support household in fuel poverty during winter what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter what estimate she have make of the number of household in fuel poverty in winter fuel poverty be devolved matter the late figure publish on february show that million household be in fuel poverty in the government continue to deliver financial support to low income home and vulnerable household through the warm home discount scheme and cost of living payment as be sure you be aware mr speaker the cost of living crisis be far from over for constituent in our area the government late energy efficiency policy the great british insulation scheme be suppose to insulate home year but so far just family have be help in eight month include only home in lancashire and just six in blackburn will the minister explain why currently it will take year to meet their three year target energy efficiency be incredibly important to this government and we have many scheme available the great british insulation scheme alone have commit million hear what the minister say about the great british insulation scheme it come after the green deal and the green home grant but frankly it look like another failure there be million people live in south yorkshire but just of their home have be upgrade under the gbis my constituent want their bill cut emission reduce and their home insulate but government incompetence be stand in the way when will the minister get grip we be spend billion in this parliament and furth billion up to to make building include private rent property clean and warm that be in addition to the estimate billion that will be deliver for the energy company obligation and the great british insulation scheme up to march over the past two year my constituent in motherwell and wishaw as well as the disability group that engage with have tell harrowing tale of dire fuel poverty and energy debt while the energy giant post record profit even with the new price cap national energy action estimate that there will be million uk household in fuel poverty with energy debt sit at billion after april the only support available will be the warm home discount which have barely be increase in decade when will the government take meaningful action and finally consult on an energy social tariff last winter this government deliver billion for household and business we also have the warm home discount the winter fuel payment and the disability cost of live payment we be committed to ensure that affordability be top of our list in relation to energy security we have have year of fiasco after fiasco with energy save scheme from this government frankly my constituent be feed up with it in gateshead just seven home have be upgrade under the government late energy efficiency scheme can the minister say why this be such disaster and why progress be so slow we continue to drive energy efficiency improvement for low income and fuel poor household through scheme include the energy company obligation the social housing decarbonisation scheme and the home upgrade grant recent report from the energy and climate intelligence unit expose the government record on insulation and say that the government false claim about their success mostly involve take credit for scheme that be legacy of the last labour government record low of around measure be instal in total under the government programme in be not the truth that this government be fail million of people in fuel poverty this government have provide unprecedented support for people in this country have regular meeting with stakeholder charity and different organisation undoubtedly we be make sure that people have support through as have mention the warm home discount the energy price cap and lot of other payment such as the cost of live payment of per annum talk of fuel poverty the boiler tax result in consumer pay an extra when they purchase new boiler do the minister agree that it be now time to ditch these unworkable and unaffordable net zero policy and let the british people decide how to heat their home and what car to drive so that they can keep more of their own money no decision have yet be take on that but we have commitment to ensure that we get the very good deal for all our constituent call the shadow minister year ago the then energy secretary say that if supplier have wrongly instal prepayment meter in any home they would have to recompense their customer for the way they have behave one year later can the minister tell the house how many individual who have prepayment meter wrongly instal have have compensation how many be yet to receive it and of those still wait when they will get the compensation one thing on which we can all agree across the house be that it be absolutely abhorrent that people have prepayment meter force on they we be work our way through the compensation but can assure members that we be do everything we can to ensure that when prepayment meter be instal we be do exactly the right thing to make sure that everybody be keep safe ask the minister three question but do not get an answer to any of they perhaps she can put the figure in the house of commons library because she clearly do not have clue what they be more than million household be in debt to their energy supplier and almost million household be live in cold damp and poorly insulate home the great british insulation scheme be prove to be great tory insulation fiasco will the minister tell why the insulation scheme be prove to be such disaster we have take great step to support people for example last winter we give unprecedented support to household and business of course debt be major concern and have regular meeting with stakeholder to ensure that we be do the very good not only to get people out of debt but to prevent they get into debt in the first place new nuclear what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on deliver new nuclear power station what step she be take to increase nuclear energy capacity what step she be take to increase nuclear energy capacity what step she be take to increase nuclear energy capacity the civil nuclear road map reconfirm the government ambition to deploy up to gw of nuclear power by it set out plan to make investment decision about gw to gw every five year between and thank the minister for his answer new nuclear hold the key not only to ensure energy security but to create thousand of high skilled well pay job in the area where it be locate but too often the planning process can take year even on site where there be long establish nuclear use have he discuss with ministerial colleague what can be do to shorten that process significantly can confirm that have have those conversation and the government be explore the potential for reduce regulatory burden for the consenting and licensing of new nuclear power station without impact safety security or environmental protection we be also look to introduce range of other streamline measure include the action plan for reform which set out reform to the nationally significant infrastructure project regime will the minister confirm that nuclear decommissioning authority own land adjacent to sellafield will be make available for new nuclear more specifically will enough land be make available to accommodate two mw rolls royce power station and their ancillary building and space can confirm that moorside be indeed candidate for new nuclear and it be one of number of potential site for host civil nuclear project great british nuclear be currently run competitive process to select those small modular reactor technology well able to facilitate operational project in the that say the project need to run its course and know my hon friend will understand that no decision on site have yet be make the uk first nuclear fusion power plant be due to be build short minute drive from lincoln it will increase energy generation and hopefully limit the amount of agricultural land be use to house solar farm will my hon friend update the house on the role that institution such as the university of lincoln will have in provide research and training for these type of power plant and their associate advanced job of the future it be indeed very exciting time for fusion in this country our fusion futures programme will provide up to million over five year to train more than people help meet the demand of our grow fusion sector that will expand our exist fusion training programme through work with university such as the university of lincoln college and employer and provide pipeline of highly skilled scientist engineer and technician at all career level from apprentice to post doctoral fellow berkeley have secure incredibly exciting investment in nuclear innovation with consortium involve rolls royce and the university of bristol low carbon energy park with international status at berkeley and oldbury next door go hand in hand as the severn edge project the government have good opportunity to meet their energy security ambition and lead the way will my hon friend provide assurance that he will work with western gateway on severn edge hear he say that the competition have to run its course but will the course be run ahead of the summer recess my hon friend be tempt oldbury be candidate for new nuclear and one of number of potential site that could host civil nuclear project it be exciting and encouraging to see the number of site and project come forward for investment as say the competition have to run its course and no decision on site have be make but it be very encouraging to see such interest across the country in our great nuclear future nuclear power plant come with huge up front capital cost even small modular reactor have considerable price tag so it be important that the government get their procurement right for once do the minister agree that smr offer possibility for economy of scale large number could be commission at once give potential saving to the taxpayer while deliver reliable baseload supply to the national grid yes of course agree that be one of the huge benefit along with many other of small modular reactor which be why we be run our down selection programme and support export from this country to across the world so that other country can join we on our nuclear journey invest in small modular advanced modular and gigawatt scale project over the next few year the delivery of nuclear power station for northern ireland be something that would welcome but other party in northern ireland might have concern about it the one thing that we in northern ireland can all agree on be that as part of this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we must be part of the manufacture base and procurement process can the minister confirm that the people of northern ireland will have that opportunity not only can confirm that but put on record my support to all the company in northern ireland that be already integral to the supply chain for our nuclear sector our nuclear revival not only will deliver more secure robust and clean energy baseload but have the potential to create thousand of new manufacturing and supply chain job across the country and want that to impact positively on every corner of our united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland call the shadow minister contrary to propaganda from the conservative side the last labour government hand over detailed nuclear development plan that run up to with site identify for nuclear development early discussion with nuclear developer and plan for deep and secure nuclear repository since then over year not one electron of new nuclear power have be produce hinkley be now at risk of further delay and no progress at all have be make on the establishment of secure storage site for nuclear waste what assurance can the minister give that lesson have be learn from that frankly fairly lamentable stewardship of the previous plan and that the late plan be set up to deliver have never be accuse of propagandise before it be matter of pride on the conservative benches that every single nuclear project that have ever be complete in this country have be complete under conservative government it do not look as though that be likely to change any time soon despite the protestation and near damascene conversion of labour front benchers on nuclear over the past few year we be carry on with our nuclear revival we have set out our nuclear road map and we be encouraging enthuse and invest in our civil nuclear sector be very excited about the progress that we have make and what will take place in the sector over the next few year use of agricultural land for solar what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help ensure that land use for food production be not use for solar installation the planning policy priority be the effective use of land by direct solar project to locate on previously develop low grade land and it be design to avoid mitigate and where necessary compensate for impact on the good agricultural land the prime minister be very clear that vast swathe of agricultural land would not be lose to solar on his watch yet be see thousand of acre across my constituency be build out or propose for solar from kimble wick to dinton ford to beachampton and more include the late acre abomination in the claydon know as rosefield good agricultural land that regularly produce wheat harvest of tonne per hectare for example be often falsely grade as because the reading be take from the headland not the field when will my hon friend ensure that energy policy do not trump food security and stop the mass proliferation of agricultural land be use for inefficient solar understand the concern and frustration of my hon friend and his constituent that particular project be at the pre application planning stage the application be expect to be submit to the planning inspectorate between january and march however as know he understand owe to the quasi judicial role of ministers in determine application it would not be appropriate for to comment on any specific matter in relation to that project but can reassure he that all application be judge on their individual merit and encourage he and all his affected constituent to engage with the planning process at every stage as it continue with all due respect to conservative members who always represent the farming industry as do we in the liberal democrats farmer be not stupid they will not take high quality agricultural land out of production and that be not happen so really worry about the argument be make here we be far behind our renewable target for solar so what incentive can the government provide to get more not less uk solar off the ground can reassure the hon lady that the solar taskforce will publish its recommendation imminently and we have an ambitious target of deploy gw of solar across the uk by resident in staffordshire moorlands be very concerned about number of planning application for solar farm and battery storage plant on farmland they have number of question so can my hon friend ensure that small district council have the appropriate expertise to look at those application can he make sure that proximity to the national grid be take into consideration and that when there be number of application relate to adjoining piece of land those application be consider as whole rather than look at individually thank my right hon friend for her question and reassure she that we take all those concern incredibly seriously be very happy to meet she and any other member of parliament who have concern about the plan be put forward in their constituency as have say it be really important that everybody from member of parliament through to those in the community who be affect by or have concern about plan can engage with the planning process at every stage we will do what we can to address those concern while meet our ambitious target of deploy gw of solar by be delighted to see you in your place mr speaker some people have short memory bear in mind the difficulty that farmer be face particularly those with rocky or infertile land will the minister have discussion with his colleague in the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs to ensure that some of that land be use in way that maximise the benefit to the farming community as well as contribute to net zero thank the hon member for his question can assure he that we be already engage with the national farmers union indeed it have be work with the solar taskforce to enable we to work with farmer and understand their concern be very happy to meet farming representative from all part of the united kingdom to determine how we can well support they and reach our net zero objective by the date we have set ourselves one of the argument put forward for large solar farm on agricultural land in my constituency be that there be limited point of interconnection with the national grid for large solar farm developer wish to contract with it could my hon friend the minister advise on whether that be the case and if it be could he follow up on that and advise all member of parliament on where those limitation exist thank my hon friend for his question obviously do not know the detail of the case he raise but be very happy to meet he follow question to look at it in more detail despite what say about the quasi judicial role of ministers in planning application it be really important that all concern be address and look at and that the planning application system be thorough robust and transparent on land use for food production and achieve net zero have the minister do an impact assessment of the rise carbon emission from the uk government carry on with their agricultural policy which be reduce incentive for farmer to produce food as consequence we will import more food as thing stand we produce only of the food we eat import more and more food will surely increase carbon emission have the minister look into that and do an impact assessment of it at the national farmers union conference just last week the prime minister reiterate this government commitment to support british farmer in their primary role of deliver food for the nation it would be good to see the liberal democrats give their support to british farmer in so forceful manner we be absolutely determined to do what we can to support british farmer in continue to deliver that food and indeed to support the technology that we need to reach our net zero commitment which be lead to believe the liberal democrats still support energy standing charges whether she have have discussion with energy provider on reduce energy standing charge for charity and business the setting of tariff include stand charge in the non domestic market be commercial matter for supplier the secretary of state and have meet supplier and ofgem multiple time over the past year to urge they to support business and keep bill down and ofgem have recently call for input and view on stand charge mr speaker associate myself with your early remark about the sad passing of my dear friend ronnie campbell and indeed lord cormack for month now east durham trust in my constituency have be in dispute with its supplier totalenergies after totalenergies raise its standing charge from day to day an increase of over remarkably after make complaint to the department ofgem northern powergrid and totalenergies find out just yesterday that totalenergies have agree to remotely reconfigure the meter in question can the minister explain why energy company and distributor do not seek to address customer issue soon and do she agree that we have fail regulator and an energy system that seek to maximise profit be pleased to hear from the hon gentleman that the situation have be resolve and suggest that exactly the right recourse be to contact the relevant party we be now launch the ability of the ombudsman to help small business as well which reassure that such case will be see to more quickly and resolve soon call the snp spokesperson in the uk electricity standing charge will balloon by mean that people in scotland who be pay year in will soon need to find year increase under this tory government that remove the incentive to curb excessive use and present disincentive to economise on energy usage if cost and charge be redistribute to the unit price consumer would be empower to pursue reduced usage know that that would translate into low bill what assessment have the minister make of the saving that would be make in term of both carbon emission and the need for vast piece of new energy infrastructure if the standing charge be roll into unit price standing charge as mention be matter for ofgem however ofgem have listen to public sentiment and it have recently launch call for input on standing charge my understanding be that to date it have have over response the call for input close on january and ofgem paper aim to ensure great understanding of how standing charge be apply to energy bill and what alternative should be consider green technologies private investment what step she be take to help increase private sector investment in green technology what step she be take to help increase private sector investment in green technology the uk have already make tremendous progress in secure investment in green technology recent figure indicate that there be billion of investment in the uk in mean that since the uk have have billion of public and private investment in low carbon sector since take office in september we have put in place new policy and sign deal with different country and the investment have continue to flow with plan for around billion of new investment in low carbon sector announce by the private sector thank my right hon friend for that answer harmony energy base in knaresborough open europe large battery farm in yorkshire in it have raise the issue of connectivity challenge be blockage to investment so welcome the connection action plan which aim to cut connection time by up to battery farm be critical for energy retention and storage and be particularly helpful for renewable so may ask my right hon friend for an update on how the plan be be implement we have set out the most radical reform to the grid since the as the action plan set out we be take action with ofgem and network company to accelerate those really important network connection network company be offer early connection to battery storage and generation project for example gw of battery storage project be already be offer connection date to the transmission network that be on average four year early than be originally agree the uk ceramic sector have invest heavily in energy efficiency technology and it be commit to go far but many of the alternative green technology be not yet viable and there be serious risk that too stringent net zero target will result in carbon leakage and in offshore an industry and skilled job to country that have far bad environmental record will my right hon friend look seriously at exempt the ceramics sector from the emission trading scheme to give the sector the breathing space that it need to invest commend my hon friend unwavering commitment to advocate for the ceramics sector in his constituency the uk government remain steadfast in safeguard sector deem at risk of carbon leakage and strongly encourage the ceramics sector in his constituency to actively participate in the consultation on free allocation policy which be open new report from the green finance institute and the institute for public policy research note that lack of public investment and strategy be hold back progress on unlock private investment and that the chopping and changing of policy pathway have damage investor confidence the secretary of state like to say that she have clear strategy so will she tell investor what it be will she call on the chancellor to deliver the scale of public investment that we so urgently need to restore investor confidence and lift the uk off the bottom of the league table for private investment where we currently languish thank the hon lady for that question but be surprised that she do not welcome the recent news that the uk be the first country in the to halve its emission since the as know that subject be dear to her heart as have say in the uk see around billion of low carbon private and public investment we get that extraordinary success by encourage private investment whether through the contract for difference scheme our new policy on capital allowance or the effect of the green industry growth accelerator on the supply chain the uk be do everything it can to attract investment and that be exactly why we have make those achievement last week the scottish government announce million of public investment in new cable factory which will attract furth million of inward investment do the secretary of state agree that the good way to increase private investment be for the government to increase public investment to signal that the uk be open to green investment should not the uk government therefore invest at least billion year so that we can maximise private investment and so that economic growth from the green transition be also maximise as say our record on net zero investment be incredibly strong in fact believe the cbi have report out this morning show that our net zero sector have be grow by in the last year we have set out plan for further investment whether that be in grid connection supply chain investment through our gigafund or reform capital allowance all those thing and not public sector investment alone attract private investment to this country call the shadow minister this government be lock in doom loop of inertia and everyone be talk about it just this week the national infrastructure commission say that the government be take too long need to move fast and that great urgency be require the cbi report that the secretary of state mention say that strong future growth from green business be be put at risk labour national wealth fund will crowd in private investment and create thousand of good job for plumber engineer electrician and welder be blow our advantage and lose the race for the industry of the future part of the government plan or do they just not have one thank the hon lady for have the chutzpah to attempt that question if she would like to talk about uncertainty on investment plan she need only look at those on the benches behind she who have perform the most extraordinary flip flop on that we have deliver the second high cumulative amount of record low carbon investment across europe over the past five year high carbon advertising if she will meet representative of adfree cities to discuss high carbon advertising the advertising standards authority be responsible for regulate advertising in the uk across traditional form of medium and it take environmental issue seriously encourage the hon gentleman to approach the asa directly with that request as it operate independently of government call barry sheerman thank you for wake up mr speaker the adfree cities campaign be very significant most of we have see flash coloured screen proliferate in our town and city and much more densely in other country such as france and germany not only do these screen use lot of energy and electricity but they be very invasive of people dwelling can we be very careful about the proliferation of those screen as say the asa would be the key people to go to company in the sector be and should be mindful of their net zero obligation they be look into make commitment to source all their electricity from renewable source which be solid thing to do as well as use digital technology to minimise energy usage the net zero council be produce road map for all industry sector across the economy to encourage business to do everything they can to minimise their environmental impact petrol price what step she be take to help reduce the price of fuel at petrol station last week we launch consultation close on march on require petrol station to report change in price within minute pumpwatch will enable driver to make informed decision on where to buy fuel and will reignite competition thank the minister for her answer but my constituent in stafford remain concerned about the price of fuel particularly give the pressure on their household budget welcome the fact that the price of tank of fuel be low than it be when price be at their peak but what be she do to ensure that my constituent get the good price for their fuel we be committed to make sure that consumer get fair deal that be why fuel retailer must remain transparent and not overcharge driver the pumpwatch consultation will require all petrol station to report price within minute of their change that will enable tech company to develop new way for uk driver to search for the cheap fuel in rural community across devon people feel the pressure of high fuel cost the cost of fuel in town such as honiton be almost litre high than at petrol station just mile away what step will the government take to ensure fairness and to introduce rural fuel duty relief of the sort that we already have in some part of north devon pumpwatch will help with those thing but it be unacceptable for any fuel retailer to overcharge driver that be why the secretary of state hold roundtable in december with fuel retailer to make it clear that we expect they to pass on saving to consumer when price fall home energy efficiency what recent step she have take to help improve the energy efficiency of home pay tribute to the hon member for her committed work to support her constituent live in rural area we have proud record of energy efficiency we be encouraging rather than force people to make the right choice and we push back the ban on gas boiler while increase the boiler upgrade scheme to which be one of the most generous grant in europe there be list property in north shropshire accord to the listed property owners club and conservation area across our historical market town and village that mean that there be large number of building that owner find it difficult to upgrade to make they energy efficient what conversation have the minister have with her colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities and the department for culture media and sport on enable people to bring those home into the century and make they energy efficient the hon member make good point we have those consultation across departments and local authority in rural area in england be eligible for grant can give my assurance that we have those cross government meeting many off grid home across cornwall can not convert to energy efficient heating scheme without incur huge cost one option for they be to use hydro treat vegetable oil can the minister lie out what plan the government have to support those use renewable liquid heating fuel and will she back the campaign by our excellent candidate for camborne and redruth connor donnithorne to axe the tax on hvo thank my hon friend for raise that point we have begin develop consultation on the role of renewable liquid fuel in heat we expect department for energy security and net zero ministers to receive detailed information on the shape of the consultation in the come week and aim to publish in the summer of electricity market review when she plan to publish the second consultation on the review of electricity market arrangement the government plan to publish the second consultation imminently it will set out clear direction on how the gb electricity market arrangement will evolve to keep electricity bill as low as possible for consumer of all type there be two question that my constituent ask most frequently when will we see cheap electricity from renewable and when people in area such as mine which host lot of renewable production benefit from cheap price as result of host that infrastructure the government be move on from our appalling inheritance in of less than of our electricity come from renewable with that figure today up to well over every day we add to that we displace gas and other fossil fuel and low bill for people and we plan to keep that go we already have solar onshore wind and other developer provide benefit to consumer and we will come forward with plan for those host order call sir george howarth people who be consider change their boiler struggle to find accurate information about the benefit and the cost will the minister consider issue new guidance that make clear both the cost and the benefit of switch to heat pump it can be complex matter that be why the government have commit to look at rebalance the system cost across electricity and gas as well as to ensure that people can benefit as do from heat pump which provide warm home and low bill energy cost what step her department be take to help reduce energy cost for household what step she be take to provide support with energy bill ofgem new price cap mean that from april the average bill be set to drop by this show that our plan be work we have halve inflation and energy price be at their low level in two year alongside that we have take the number of home that be well insulate up from in to now we have recently set out plan to help more customer access smart energy tariff which could save they up to year be grateful for the answer but one thing my constituent in stirling do not understand be electricity standing charge as we have hear accord to ofgem figure they have rocket by from in to in ofgem have issue call for evidence which be to be welcome but ofgem be clearly not fit for purpose on this do the secretary of state agree that it be high time the uk government step in the hon gentleman be right that ofgem regulate stand charge and have issue call for evidence think about people have give input and we look forward to see the result however if he be really worried about the cost of live for family in the country the snp would not have take taxis in scotland to the high level in the uk the fall in the energy price cap be certainly welcome by carshalton and wallington resident as be the support for household but many small and medium sized business in my constituency be still struggle to absorb high cost will the secretary of state outline in bit more detail the support that those business can access to help with energy bill thank my hon friend for recently welcome to carshalton and wallington wholesale energy price have fall significantly since last winter but we be commit to support business with their energy bill last winter alone we deliver about billion to support business cover nearly half of many business wholesale energy cost we be continue the energy bill discount scheme to support eligible business with high energy cost until they can take advantage of low wholesale price topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility lot have happen since be last at the dispatch box not only have energy bill fall to their low level in two year welcome news for family up and down the country but britain have become the first major economy to halve our emission which be huge milestone on our journey to net zero our offshore petroleum licensing bill have complete its commons stage and we be support the north sea by protect job and use our own gas to heat our home have sign new partnership with canada on fusion energy which be technology that could give we limitless energy and one on which britain be lead the world we have confirm the uk departure from the energy charter treaty which be hold back our transition to clean cheap energy we have launch consultation on smart energy tariff which could see take off people bill and today we host our hydrogen investor forum announce eight successful project to make low carbon hydrogen with over million of government support resident in esclusham in my constituency be alarm by innova plan for the uk large lithium ion battery storage facility near bersham can my right hon friend give any reassurance about the safety of this technology to my constituent who be concerned about the danger of pollution give the noise emit by such equipment and by report of similar facility elsewhere explode catch fire and emit toxic fume electricity storage allow we to use energy more flexibly and to minimise energy bill grid scale lithium ion battery energy storage system be cover by robust regulatory framework that be principally see by the health and safety executive plan guidance encourage developer and local authority to consult relevant fire and rescue service on aspect such as location ahead of any planning decision be make call the snp spokesperson some of household in scotland be live in extreme fuel poverty energy debt across the united kingdom have reach billion age uk estimate that have the uk government implement social tariff this winter million household would have be lift out of poverty the late cost of unpayable energy debt have once again be heap on to ordinary taxpayer by ofgem through the unit rate what assessment have the secretary of state make of how much energy debt could be reduce by through the introduction of social tariff to mitigate totally unaffordable energy bill the fact that energy price be at the low level in two year be good news for family up and down the country we have put in place support include package of more than billion to support family that be per household on average as part of that we have make cost of live payment to help people in the last year energy be vital purchase for the hospitality sector and can make up large part of the overall cost what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that the energy cost face by pub hotel and food business do not put they out of business thank my hon friend for that important question wholesale energy price have fall compare with last year the government have be support eligible business lock into high contract through the energy bill discount scheme until they can take advantage of low fix price rate my hon friend will be interested to hear that the government deliver more than billion to non domestic energy user last winter cover around half of many business energy bill call the shadow secretary of state last september the energy secretary claim she be lift the onshore wind ban but in the whole of and so far in there have be zero application for new onshore wind farm design for domestic electricity supply in england she say that her decision would speed up the delivery of project why do she think it have not work let be clear about our record on onshore wind energy production have quadruple since when we have gw of onshore wind to gw in we have connect the second high amount of renewable anywhere in europe whereas the right hon gentleman plan have be widely discredit by industry and would deter billion of pound of investment in clean energy the right hon lady do not answer the question will tell she why it have not work because she have leave uniquely restrictive planning regime in place for onshore wind her failure be cost family across this country year on their bill we know that her policy have fail she could dump the ban at the stroke of pen if she be vaguely serious about clean energy why do she not face down the headbanger on her back benches and lift the ban as say we have connect the second high amount of renewable electricity anywhere in europe since our record on renewable energy be clear this be the most extraordinary deflection that have see in recent week the right hon gentleman leader have shred his policy platform on energy to be honest feel quite sorry for he because thank to the action of his leader and his shadow chancellor he have be hide away his policy have be rip up and it be now obvious to everyone that labour have no plan for energy far to the question by my hon friend the member for south west bedfordshire andrew selous about the review of

than they charge customer just few mile up the road in sheffield it be clear that the government approach be not work when write to the major supermarket they admit that they charge chesterfield

question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make statement on international supply of military equipment and ammunition to ukraine the uk have be lead international support for the armed force of ukraine for year since russia first invade crimea in train more than new recruit since and commit almost billion in economic humanitarian and military aid since from the uk found uk administer international fund for ukraine which have pledge more than million to spearheading capability coalition our effort have pave the way and make genuine difference our nlaw anti tank missile and our javelins help brave ukrainians to devastate putin menacing mile armoured convoy which be head for kyiv we be the first to send main battle tank with our challenger squadron plus armoured vehicle and anti armour weapon last week the defence secretary announce to this house new package of brimstone anti tank missile plus million for artillery munition the uk will also co lead an international capability coalition alongside latvia to supply cutting edge drone to ukraine in addition to the uk co leadership of the international maritime capability coalition the defence secretary have urge partner and ally to commit to long term support for ukraine at the nato defence ministers meeting on february the defence secretary and his counterpart from nato ally and sweden sign an agreement on two new multinational procurement initiative focus on munition and missile spearhead by the uk these initiative aim to increase defence industrial capacity across the euro atlantic area replenish stockpile at pace and continue support to ukraine commend the government for their impressive record but do the minister accept that the equipment pledge by nato nation be not reach ukraine in anything like the amount promise do he accept for example that less than third of the million shell promise by eu nation have arrive that more than artillery barrel will reach the end of their productive life this year that very few pilot be be train and that the ukrainians be perilously short of air defence this be at time when the russians be on war footing with of all their government spending gear towards the destruction of the ukrainian state specifically may ask whether defence intelligence and the government reckon that the ukrainians will be able to hold their current position and if so for how long when will artillery stock run even lower and fall off cliff edge will the minister confirm that we have deliver on all our pledge be in east ukraine last week do he understand that after the obliteration of the frontline town of avdiivka the ukrainians be now ask which of their town will be the next to be destroy by russian artillery while ukrainian soldier die because they lack kit finally do he accept that the situation be become acutely dangerous for everybody with the force of fascism begin to overpower free state and their nato ally where do he believe we might be with security throughout europe in the next few month be extremely grateful to my hon friend and pay tribute to he and all parliamentarian who have visit ukraine and show our solidarity and support for our ally know that he have background as an officer in the intelligence corps so he speak not only with the passion we all share but with significant expertise on these matter he will therefore be aware that there be limit to what can say on the operational situation and be draw into try to estimate the level of supply these be all sensitive and important point think we can all agree that what my hon friend say about air support and training be important be at raf valley recently and as understand it we be provide ukrainians with elementary fly training we be fly the and we have typhoon while other country will be provide the actual platform he be absolutely right to say that air defence be critical part of the conflict and we need to supply more we have provide over air defence system but we want to do more on the overall position as have say we can not provide running commentary on the exact operational situation but we provide regular tweet share what intelligence we can fundamentally my hon friend be right to warn all of we and indeed our ally of the risk be the situation to be reverse we can say with some certainty that when the war start we would all have be surprised to be in this situation with ukraine have win back so much territory and frankly remain in the fight that be thank in huge part to the role of the united kingdom and we should be proud of that as the secretary of state confirm in his recent oral statement we provide nlaw before russia invade and have be train ukrainians since in total but know there be more to do my hon friend have very good understanding of these matter these capability coalition one on drone and the other on maritime be good way to turn the support that have be provide into targeted and effective capability on the frontline we be clear that we need to do more and our ally need to stay with we in the fight call the shadow minister as we mark two year since vladimir putin brutal illegal invasion begin it should be source of pride to all in this house that the uk remain totally united and commit to support ukraine we must continue to stand with the ukrainian people for as long as it take for they to win on military help for ukraine and on reinforce our nato ally the uk government have have and will continue to have labour full support at yesterday opening of the paris summit to shore up support for ukraine western leader rightly make it clear that russia be far from spend force and that putin will not stop at ukraine if he win as russia step up its war effort we must step up our support and so must ukraine other ally labour welcome the extra brimstone anti tank missile and the million artillery munition package for ukraine which the government announce this weekend minister favour ad hoc announcement over full military aid plan for ukraine but how can industry invest and mobilise with confidence without long term plan to work against on step up western support for ukraine how be we co ordinating with our nato ally to ensure that our munition support provide ukraine with the urgent and sustained help it need of the billion announce for can the minister confirm how much be be spend on ukraine and how much be be spend on uk operational cost at nato basis give the importance of the paris summit for ukraine why be the prime minister unable to attend the event unlike other key western leader there could be change in government this year but there will be no change in britain resolve to stand with ukraine to confront russian aggression and to pursue putin for his war crime be very grateful to the hon gentleman for continue to show solidarity for the consensus that exist across the house and in particular for specifically mention the brimstone gift and the million recently announce for artillery munition the hon gentleman talk about our long term plan just to be clear the war be happen today and the key focus of the billion for ukraine this financial year be get support into the country as soon as possible which be when they need it of course we want to have long term plan too be clear that the uk will play very significant role in help ukraine when it be fully free to get back to the level of prosperity it expect for now we have to focus on what be very challenging situation drone be one of the most important capability we have see in ukraine and they have arguably transform the nature of warfare in this conflict last week be pleased to announce our own uncrewed strategy and in do so talk about the malloy drone which have do an incredible job lift blood munition and other key supply to ukrainian marine on the bank of the dnieper we have provide drone to ukraine and we will keep do that we have the million yes it be about shell and munition but we also have to provide way to fight with they we have to assist to ensure that we deliver that capability which be why those coalition be so important be glad that the hon gentleman support we in the round and we be send message that this house be unite in support ukraine call the father of the house the minister say the training start in which be the year after the house take in my view the wrong decision in the syria vote it lead to russia give help to assad the taking of crimea the infiltration of eastern ukraine and various other problem as ukraine security be in effect our security and that of our nato ally will he confirm that we will do all we can to try to make sure that ukraine be safe and that russia at some stage return to be peaceful nation devote to the prosperity of its own people rather than do down other people my hon friend make an excellent point and he be absolutely right to say that their security be our security we need to support ukraine because it be morally the right thing to do to support free country that have be illegally invade we should also be clear that it be in our strategic interest and those of all of our democratic ally to do so because we do not want to see an emboldened russia not least because of the impact that could have on other potential adversary call the scottish national party spokesperson ukraine be on the frontline not only of its own battle but of those of international democracy and law we can not leave the ukrainians without in time of need their fight be our fight so let we look at what the uk government can do we must not allow putin plan to wait until the international community lose interest to succeed will the uk government prepare an international criminal court case against russia for its bombardment of civilian in ukraine what more can the uk government do to ensure the safety of ukrainian sky and to ensure united and collective western effort in continued support of ukraine once again be grateful for the hon gentleman support and that of the snp in ensure that we have this strong consensus across the house in support of the ukrainians as he say their fight be our fight strongly agree he be also right about the icc as for where the ministry of defence be focus he make an important point about the threat in the air as say air defence have be crucial but of course that fight take many form we need to look at not only ground to air system but drone which have proliferate and have an extraordinary impact we know that we can not provide the which be the ukrainians fighter of choice but we have do what we can by provide the elementary fly training and absolutely assure he that we will do everything we can call the chair of the select committee welcome all that the government have be do include on brimstone and the package of million worth of ammunition however may ask specifically about mm shell and the bae systems production line have it now get the order to ensure that it be work at maximum capacity on war footing to produce all it can to support ukraine and indeed in due course our own stockpile it be pleasure to take my first contribution from my right hon friend in the chamber since he become chairman of the select committee look forward to further discussion with he later this afternoon on other matter before the committee he be right to stress the importance of that mm shell be one of the fundamental munition we need to see both replenish for the uk armed force and where possible provide into ukraine along with other key artillery class can confirm that we sign that contract with bae last july and it should lead to an eightfold increase in mm production initially in the washington plant but thereafter in south wales be keen to see that get go as soon as possible the mod have clearly do decent job of support ukraine but still doubt that the government as whole be seize of the urgent critical nature of this crisis return to the question ask the secretary of state last week why when it be clear early in that this be go to be very much an artillery war date back to the last century do it take until to place the order for additional artillery shell the minister should have the answer by now refer to the previous answer give where be clear that we place that order last july as the right hon gentleman rightly say that be for our own armed force and it be an eightfold increase but we have provide artillery shell into ukraine we have procure they sir we have do that not just from this country we have do it through rapid procurement through defence equipment and support all can say be that pay tribute to that effort we all know that we need to go far the other point be that this be not just about what we have procure this country have play lead role in ensure that other nation join we and provide more munition that be as much key part of the role that we have play last week in the nato parliamentary assembly joint session in brussels top military leader describe to we their concern that the eu ethical banking law be go to stop investment in arm company will my hon friend confirm that the uk will always ensure that the money need to invest in make sure that europe can protect itself against russian aggression will be there and that the arm can be manufacture my right hon friend ask about an excellent point both the secretary of state and have comment on that have hold meeting at the treasury and with defence company about the esg environmental social and governance issue as well as with financial institution at rothschild in the city because it be extraordinary that anyone should think we should not invest in core munition when we see now that the cause they support be peace freedom and democracy if we do not fund our defence sector we simply will not be able to defend those fine principle president zelensky say yesterday that without new military aid from the united states ukraine would be unable to defend the black sea shipping corridor which have enable the export of million metric tonne of ukrainian grain that have be enable in part by the supply by the uk of the storm shadow missile and by france supply of the scalp missile what be the government discuss with german counterpart about their potential to supply their equivalent the taurus missile system know that the hon gentleman also serve and speak with expertise on these matter he be right to raise the issue of the strategic importance of the black sea we have have huge progress in that area believe that since we reopen that corridor through the success that the ukrainians have have with our support in push back the russian fleet to the east some million tonne of grain have get through that underline how important that corridor be but he be right to say that we need to look at what more we can do obviously be not go to comment on sensitive matter about individual country capability but he can rest assure that we continue to engage with all our ally on these point the russian invasion of ukraine be direct threat to europe and of course to wide global security as my hon friend will know russia have increase as part of its war mobilisation its production of shell and ammunition by some factor of or it be plan to do so in the next two or three year what conversation have he have across europe and with nato ally about the long term response to this serious challenge my right hon friend recently join the select committee and welcome he to it he make an excellent point first there be lot of speculation about the level of production by the russians they have need to increase that because they have lose huge amount of ordnance and armoured vehicle and tragically large number of personnel on the long term draw his attention to the mpi which be where we be join other nato member for collective order of ordnance the first one we have announce be for missile and for munition that be powerful signal we hope it will send strong demand signal to industry in europe but it also send signal to putin and the world that we be determined to stand together and stand up to putin the uk have great record of support ukraine for example train ukrainian troop be something we can be really proud of but may press the minister on something how much of the billion for be be spend on ukraine and how much be be spend on uk operational cost at nato basis my right hon friend the minister for armed forces answer that in detail at oral question the key point be that we will not do line by line breakdown of every aspect of the billion can assure the hon gentleman that it be an incredibly important step forward in our support to ukraine as he know we have be able to confirm that that include for example million on artillery munition and million on drone those be incredibly important commitment and they go with all the other effort we have make but we know that there be more to do with our ally along with group of colleague go to the us before christmas to try to persuade the republicans there to vote this bill through urgently we have marginal effect on they the thing say to they be you be face an axis of authoritarianism china north korea russia and iran be all in league together and they be win when be in ukraine see the ukrainians take mine out with bayonet and not have the equipment they need do my hon friend agree that this have tell we that none of we be ready for what war be really all about barbed wire minefield and artillery shell do he not agree that we need to do more pay tribute to my right hon friend for his incredibly important effort engage with the us obviously the position the us take and the decision it make on support be matter for the us government and legislature but my right hon friend be right to make the wide strategic point surely we be unite on the need to have deterrent against all the adversary and threat we face around the world sincerely hope it will not be the case but if russia be to make much more progress and succeed it would embolden other adversary he be right about the horror of warfare that be why we need to invest in our own armed force and conventional deterrent but above all to keep support ukraine as much as we possibly can the halo trust estimate that around million landmine have be lay in ukraine mike newton from the halo trust have say ukraine can not be rebuild until the landmine be remove life itself depend on get rid of they what be the minister do to ensure that fund go to the demining of ukraine what more preventive work can we do internationally to persuade those country that be supply landmine to desist from do so and to sign the landmine convention the hon lady excellent point about mine follow on from the point make by my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith be happy to go away and look into that to see what we be able to say about what we be do she will appreciate that there be also the issue of naval mine believe we will be look at that but there be some sensitivity within the maritime capability coalition will look into the issue far can not say that there be button can press to stop those country that be provide those munition but we know putin keep some rather interesting company and that we as democracy need to stand together to ensure we support ukraine in this fight will my hon friend join in pay tribute to the fantastic work be do by defence equipment and support in my constituency in ensure that the overwhelming amount of support and military equipment we have supply arrive on time at the frontline what can we do to speed up the process of collaboration in manufacturing in ukraine between british and ukrainian company that will be huge in the future to ensure that the ukrainians can produce their own kit on the ground and provide deterrent after they have beat the russians my hon friend be sterling in his championing of the ukrainian cause and of the excellent work do by in his constituency have visit abbey wood twice and there be excellent leadership under andy start have be responsible for the procurement of huge amount of munition and material at pace in ukraine but my hon friend be right that we also need to think about the long term and how ukraine can start to build its own industrial base that be why we recently have our first defence trade visit there be keen to see much more of that and please to have his support for that work may take the opportunity to reiterate how proud we be of our armed force personnel who have work around the clock to train and support ukrainian recruit as part of the vital op interflex urge the government to confirm where that programme will be after the summer and to make commitment to it for as long as it take ukraine to win the hon lady make the good point that we should pay tribute to all the personnel involve in operation interflex we have provide huge amount of training go to salisbury plain to meet the irish guards who be train ukrainian civilian of all background who would have but week of training before return to pretty attritional conflict we all need to reflect on that it be an incredible operation that have have international support from many other nation the hon lady be right that we be in it for the long term and we will keep train ukrainians to defend their homeland have just return from ukraine there be absolutely nothing but praise for what britain have do in provide the munition and equipment require and in stand up to putin when so many other blink at that moment it be clear that what be happen in ukraine will move out far putin be now more powerful than stalin and be try to emulate what stalin do in eastern europe can we agree that europe be at war this affect our economy and our security we have show leadership up to now so can we continue by allow frozen asset base in the uk belong to russia to be slide across the table to ukraine as ever my right hon friend make some excellent point pay tribute to he and other colleague who go to ukraine to show that we stand with ukraine and to show our solidarity as parliamentarian with they as free democracy he make an excellent point on frozen russian asset the prime minister be clear that he want to look at how we can do that and make the point that obviously we have to work internationally particularly with the initially we will be look at the interest earn on those asset but we should definitely be focus on this across government will the government retain uk air defence capability support nato ally on the frontline such as poland can further medical unit be dispatch to treat and rehabilitate any ukrainian or brit injure by russian force apologise for miss the first part of the hon gentleman question will write to he on that on the second part within the training figure mention there be significant training for medical personnel be happy to include that in the letter whether it be train medical personnel or frontline soldier the effort we have put in place be huge it be international and we will do everything we can to keep it go the number of nato member country meet the gdp commitment be expect to rise from seven last year to later this year indication from the us suggest that the us government be more likely to release an expect billion worth of commitment to ukraine once republican congressman have have their primary will the minister confirm that the british defence industry at home be now on war footing and that we be well able to spend uor urgent operational requirement money and deliver it to ukraine my hon friend as ever ask an excellent question as he highlight this have to be an international effort there be tendency to overplay the negative voice but my experience from international meeting be of an overwhelming consensus from small nation to large nation and of huge desire to keep support ukraine in every way possible obviously the role of the us be fundamental can give he the assurance that we will work with the british defence industry to ramp up production we will be bring forward munition strategy soon and the goal of always on production will be most in the interest of both the military and our defence sector along with colleague from across the house have just return from sobering visit to ukraine during which we hear about what some refer to as the slow yes from number of our ally on provide military supply that be cost life on the frontline and limit military option will the minister tell we what specific recent effort the government have make to convey real sense of urgency to key ally will he urge his cabinet colleague to redouble their effort in this respect assure the hon lady that at every international meeting and engagement we attend whether multilaterally or bilaterally we do everything possible to encourage our ally to join we in support as say in answer to the previous question although there be tendency to pick out negative voice the overwhelming consensus among our ally be to want to support and do more there will always be debate about how quickly we can get stuff into line we have do everything possible to get our support out as quickly as possible include predate the war itself so we can be proud of our effort be acutely aware that we need to do more particularly in concert with our ally partly as result of the magnificent effort we have make in the past couple of year our stockpile have go and our warehouse be empty very much welcome the government announcement about million for artillery shell describe by the minister but do he agree there have be series of legalistic and bureaucratic delay to the issuing of contract british manufacturer be frustrate because they be unable to crack on with produce the kind of good we need would not say that the cupboard be empty we have to have our own level of holding for our own military but we have gift as much as we can the obvious example be the that we gift we rapidly replace that with the interim artillery solution from sweden the archer gun be pleased to say that early this morning announce the launch of the next stage of the new medium helicopter competition which be an important procurement for the uk military that speak to the fact that we be still carry out core procurement for ourselves in addition to mm shell we have place order for lightweight multirole missile starstreak and whole range of other munition so we can replenish our stock we should not be afraid to say that what we have donate support and procure internationally which be huge part have play massive role that we should be proud of while recognise the need to do as much as we can with our ally go forward be privileged to join colleague on cross party delegation to ukraine this weekend the shortage of equipment ammunition and supply come up time and again how be the uk government monitor and hold accountable those involve in the supply chain to prevent delay misuse or diversion of military equipment that be good question obviously much of this work be happen internationally and in country with ukraine can not go into operational detail but absolutely it be one thing to procure the equipment and capability whether that be buy internationally gift or contribute to international fund as many country do in order that other country may do that but we need to make sure that it all get to the frontline in all the discussion that we have have about military hardware it be easy to forget the human cost of this war not least the child steal by the russians and never return to their family as we say on day one if putin win in ukraine he will not stop there other country will be next that be why it be vital that the uk and ally continue to provide ukraine with the weapon that it need but russia must also pay may ask the government to double down on the work that they be do to use the proceed of frozen russian asset to pay for this war and the reconstruction of ukraine so that russia know that it can not get away with this my right hon friend who speak with great passion be right to talk about the need to hold russia to account we have say that repeatedly we have say that in reference both to the war itself and to specific action such as those involve alexei navalny and so on we be under no illusion about the nature of that regime and what would happen if it be to succeed we have have that view right from the beginning and it be brilliant that so many country have join we in that effort strongly believe that without our effort ukraine would not still be in the fight how do we keep the ukrainians there we must keep provide the munition that we have describe keep train the personnel in interflex and keep ensure that our ally join we in all of those effort the us state department have reportedly calculate that north korea have deliver container of munition to russia for deployment in ukraine what can be do to disrupt the supply chain that be not straightforward question to answer as say right at the beginning about the thing that ultimately come from military intelligence these be sensitive matter but the hon gentleman can rest assure that these be priority that we look at very closely with our international partner too join my hon friend the member for isle of wight bob seely and other colleague in ukraine at the weekend the point about the slow yes to the provision of kit and fund be well make by the hon member for llanelli dame nia griffith as well as conventional warfare the russians be increasingly use cyber warfare recently take out virtually the whole mobile network with implication for the frontline as well central to counter that be advanced satellite technology provide by british company which also have application for mine detection have recently have spread of metre they can now get it down to cm with heat detection device these be crucial so can we make sure that we do not just limit our support to conventional warfare ammunition but look at high tech and cyber warfare which will be increasingly necessary my hon friend make an extremely important point we know already that the battle space be contest and that force need to be closely integrate but what ukraine have show above all else be the extraordinary extent to which electronic warfare play role the mass jamming across the domain have to be factor into any kit that be use and it will have to be factor into procurement go forward we must be aware of these development we have our own brilliant resource such as the defence science and technology laboratory and there be thing that we have do that be sensitive and that have provide support as far as possible but he be right to talk in particular about the importance of the space domain the uk be lucky to have strong sovereign space industry support defence in the civil sector go forward we need to be aware of how warfare be change and be able to respond rapidly with our procurement thank the minister for his helpful and encouraging answer have read in the press recently about the price of military supply and the protract situation in ukraine it be clear that help with military supply be essential as understand it missile can cost as much as million each be there any more that can be do with our nato ally financially physically and militarily to help ensure that ukraine continue to have the mean to stave off the ceaseless attack by russia as ever we save the good till last interruption oh the hon gentleman be second to last my apology nevertheless shall always say that when he be call to speak the hon gentleman make very good point about the cost when we talk about the multilateral procurement initiative we could argue that it be like bulk buy between nation obviously we want to see economy of scale for that in exchange for the massive demand signal that we will be provide for european industry however the key point be not just to send demand signal but ultimately to send deterrent signal if we in europe rally round in european nato along with our us ally and step up the pace on industrial reinvigoration in the defence space that will in itself be part of the deterrent message that we send to putin along with colleague from across the house be in ukraine at the weekend and be strike by the gratitude of the ukrainians to the uk be also strike by the word of general wesley clark speak at the yalta european strategy conference when he make prediction that we be in the second year of six year war if that prediction be accurate will the minister outline what effort be under way to locate compatible ammunition supply from country with old stock and do he agree that it be important to get supply out of stockpile and on to the frontline in ukraine so that we can tip this war in ukraine favour pay tribute to my hon friend for join other colleague in go out to ukraine show the solidarity that we have for it and the strong cross parliamentary consensus often when we talk about procurement for ukraine there can be some misunderstanding just to be clear an awful lot of the munition that have be provide be source internationally but we do not necessarily go into the minute detail of that he be absolutely right initially that mean provide what be largely ex soviet stock but in the long term we want to enable the ukrainians to produce munition to nato standard we want to work closely with they on that and that be how we will get their industry into order so that they can sustain their own ability to fight over the long term israel and gaza may start by congratulate you mr speaker on your successful visit early last week to st helena with permission shall now update the house on the situation in israel and the occupied palestinian territories let begin by reiterate israel right to defend itself against hamas we condemn the slaughter abuse and gender base violence perpetrate on october hamas use of civilian area their continue failure to release hostage and their ongoing launching of attack into israel equally we be deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in gaza with ten of thousand of innocent civilian kill and injure the most effective way to end the fighting in gaza the absolute focus of our diplomatic effort right now be to agree an immediate humanitarian pause that would allow for the safe release of hostage and significant increase in the aid go to gaza crucially it would also provide vital opportunity to establish the condition for genuinely long term and sustainable ceasefire without return to destruction fighting and loss of life that be the position share by our close partner it be an outcome that we believe be in reach right now and we urge all side to seize it many people may ask include some in this house why we be call for pause but not an immediate ceasefire we do not believe that do so hop that it somehow become permanent be the way forward simply call for ceasefire will not make one happen there be different and well way to stop the fighting permanently to push for pause and in it secure sustainable ceasefire that can hold for the long term without return to the fighting the british government have set out the vital element to achieve last peace the release of all hostage the removal of hamas capacity to launch attack against israel hamas no long be in charge of gaza the formation of new palestinian government for the west bank and gaza accompany by an international support package and political horizon that provide credible and irreversible pathway towards two state solution once we secure pause we will need to take action on all those element to create irreversible momentum towards peace meanwhile britain and our partner continue to do all we can to alleviate the suffering we treble our aid commitment this financial year and we be do everything we can to get more aid in and open more crossing last week britian and jordan airdrop life save aid to hospital in northern gaza the airdrop provide tonne of vial supply include medicine fuel and food for hospital patient and staff the tal al hawa hospital set up by the jordanian armed force be locate in gaza city and have treat thousand of patient since the start of the crisis woman be bear the brunt of the desperate humanitarian situation in gaza today many thousand be pregnant and will be worry about deliver their baby safely that be why over the weekend we also announce million of new funding for the united nations sexual and reproductive health agency in response to an appeal for the occupied palestinian territories that new uk funding will help make give birth safe and will improve the life of mother and their newborn baby it be clear however that the flow of aid need to be rapidly and significantly scale up we have reiterate the need for israel to open more crossing point into gaza for nitzana and kerem shalom to be open for long and for israel to support the un in distribute aid effectively across the whole of gaza the foreign secretary representative for humanitarian affair in the occupied palestinian territories mark bryson richardson be base in the region and be work intensively to address the blockage prevent more aid from reach gaza we also continue to urge israel to limit its operation to military target and avoid harm civilian and destroy home we have express our deep concern about the prospect and consequence of military incursion into rafah more than half of gaza population be shelter in the area include more than child and they have nowhere to go the rafah crossing remain vital to ensure aid can reach the people who so desperately need it the path to long term solution will not be easy ultimately two state solution be the good way to ensure safety and security for israelis and palestinians the foreign secretary underline that at the foreign ministers meeting in rio last week the prime minister and all ministerial colleague will continue to press for that in engagement with regional partner include with prime minister netanyahu we welcome the prospect of further normalisation agreement between israel and arab partner we be commit to support their endure success and effort to ensure that normalisation deliver benefit for the palestinians too our long stand position remain that we will recognise palestinian state at the time that be most conducive to the peace process the palestinian authority have an important long term role to play and will need continue support from we and our partner but it must also take concrete step on reform the palestinian people need technocratic and effective administration that can win the confidence of the people of gaza we stand ready to support the palestinian authority to achieve that aim follow the announcement yesterday of the resignation of the prime minister and the previous set of ministers we also remain concerned about the situation in the west bank and have take action in response to extremist settler violence repeat our commitment to find last resolution to this conflict that ensure that israelis and palestinians can live in the future with dignity and security the goal of our diplomacy in the middle east be to see an end to the fighting and create permanent peace base on new political horizon for the region we will continue work tirelessly to make that happen thank the minister for advance sight of his statement once again note with disappointment that give the seriousness of the geopolitical environment the foreign secretary be absent from scrutiny by member on both side of the house since the minister last statement there have be another month of intolerable civilian death famine and disease in gaza another month of hostage family in israel live in anguish another month of worsen regional escalation another month of war that can not and must not go on unlike the government labour have always be clear that israel must comply with the international court of justice order the icj say israel must take measure to ensure humanitarian access but last week the world food programme suspend its aid operation in northern gaza médecin sans frontières say we no long speak of humanitarian scale up we speak of how to survive even without the bare minimum the association of international development agencies tell that visa for humanitarian worker in gaza and the west bank have expire or be about to expire there have be no humanitarian visa renewal since the outbreak of this war leave humanitarian worker face deportation when the palestinian people need they most will the minister tell the israeli government that humanitarian visa must be renew now that aid into gaza must flow unimpeded now and that israel must comply with all measure set out by the icj now it be with modesty that we debate gaza in this house because it be through diplomacy not debate in westminster that we will ultimately secure an end to this war there appear to have be progress over the weekend in paris so will the minister update the house on the deal involve truce in exchange for hostage be he optimistic that it will be achieve by ramadan we all fear the war continue into ramadan will he assure we that the government be be absolutely crystal clear to israel that its threaten full offensive on rafah must not go ahead hear the minister when he say that simply call for ceasefire will not make one happen but neither will call for pause which confuse our share desire for fight to stop and not restart therefore ask the minister in all good conscience whether he really disagree that our goal should be an immediate ceasefire now do he disagree that both side should stop the fighting now do he disagree that all hostage should be release now do he disagree that aid should flow unimpeded into gaza now do he disagree that britain should work with international partner to recognise the palestinian state now do he disagree that we should work together to establish diplomatic process to deliver two state solution respect the minister the right hon gentleman greatly and strongly suspect that he agree with every word of labour position and that the foreign secretary do too can we speak together as we have do on ukraine our word bring pressure and send powerful signal that for once we can put the political game aside and meet as the government and the official opposition to agree share position and put out statement call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire now thank the shadow foreign secretary for what he say must say to he that set out at some length in the debate last week the government position in the amendment that we table have listen to he with great care today must say that his position on behalf of the official opposition be incredibly close to what the government set out in our amendment last week he ask to set out clearly our position our position be very clearly set out in that amendment be warm by the fact that his position today appear to be almost identical to that the right hon gentleman ask what the government position be we have be clear we be try to negotiate he ask whether agree with he on an immediate pause to get hostage out and to get incredibly badly need aid in lead to sustainable ceasefire he mention the position on humanitarian visa and humanitarian worker there be nothing between we on that we be do everything we can to advance that position the right hon gentleman ask about recent humanitarian entry can tell he that on sunday february truck get in but on february truck get through kerem shalom and through rafah that be the high number since january those figure show that it be possible to get vital humanitarian aid in and we must do everything we can to ensure that those high level continue the right hon gentleman ask about the hostage negotiation there have be great deal in the press over the weekend he ask whether be optimistic the answer be that be neither optimistic nor pessimistic but can tell he that the british government be do everything we can to ensure that negotiation be successful be sure that the minister agree that it be profoundly in the british interest for there to be properly function system of international rule and law and that the international court of justice be central to that system so what concrete step be the government take to enforce the court ruling on the conflict not condemn press or discuss but enforce it be it the minister view that an assault on rafah give its impact on civilian include as he point out child would be in line with the ruling of the international court of justice on his latter point my right hon friend hear what say in the statement as the whole house know the ruling of the court be bind and must therefore be respect however point out to he that recent episode of the law disorder podcast by three of the uk most experienced jurist include two senior member of the other place conclude that it be not possible at the time that episode be make to declare that israel be in breach of international humanitarian law call the snp spokesperson thank the minister for prior sight of his statement we welcome the news that ceasefire deal may be edge close we have be call for ceasefire and hostage release deal since it become apparent that israel self defence have turn into war against an entire civilian population war in which in just five month people have be kill injure and million displace now innocent people face starvation not because food be not available but because of premeditated decision to impose collective punishment one that have deliberately stop food get to those who need it throughout this unimaginable horror the uk continue to profit from the carnage by sell weapon to israel shamefully there have be no real desire or attempt from the uk to make the slaughter stop the government seem happy to continue provide tacit support for this illegal occupation this systematic decade long oppression and persecution and now the ethnic cleansing and collective punishment that go with it if and when we get us deal to the un what action will the uk government take vote for ceasefire can not happen in isolation will the uk government stop sell weapon to israel will they finally get behind the international court of justice investigation will they fund as they do quite rightly in the case of ukraine an international criminal court investigation of israel prosecution of this conflict whatever happen minister this sorry episode will be remember for be one of the most shameful in the history of british foreign policy because we have witness complete dereliction of all moral and legal responsibility from government and parliament that at the time of great humanitarian crisis have simply look the other way quite rightly history will judge they harshly for it simply do not think the idea that the government have look the other way carry any possible credibility at all the hon gentleman might remember that the source of all this be the october pogrom commit against the israeli people the bad killing of jewish people at any time since the end of the second world war there need to be some balance in what be say and the language that he use be not helpful to the central aim that we all have to bring about ceasefire and get hostage out and aid in also the hon gentleman should remember that britain have the tough weapon regulation and arm export regime of anywhere in the world he talk about collective punishment but the point that he miss be that our determination since day one have be to get as much food as we possibly can into gaza if he look back at everything the government have say on this we have be work as hard as anyone to get that humanitarian relief into gaza submit that beneath the sound and fury of what he say there be more substantial agreement between his party and the government than he recognise thank my right hon friend for come to the house and set out clear and principled statement as he know our position be thoroughly in line with that of our partner the one who be involve in very serious and sensitive negotiation right now to end the fighting will he say bit more about the concrete step towards reform he mention the palestinian authority and the resignation of prime minister shtayyeh yesterday do the reform that he have in mind include an end to endemic corruption to incitement to violence through the school curriculum and to the terrible policy of pay convict terrorist reward for have carry out murder my right hon friend recognise that there will need to be significant change in the approach that we have make on many of those issue the british five point plan encompass most of what he believe should happen the release of all israeli hostage the formation of new palestinian government for the west bank and gaza accompany by an international support package that would recognise many of the thing that he have say remove hamas capacity to launch attack against israel hamas no long be in charge of gaza and political horizon that provide credible and irreversible pathway towards two state solution within those five point rest the answer to almost every point that he raise call the chair of the international development committee my committee and be at the gaza border last week try to get first hand testimony of the million story of suffering that now represent gaza what can say to the house what we be hear be just tiny fraction of the horror that be go on out there will the minister clarify one thing with the israelis we speak to senior un security person who say that drone fly overhead be gather datum that artificial intelligence algorithm then translate into target we know that civilian humanitarian and medic be be kill so will the minister urge israeli defence to ensure that the algorithm protect the people that they be suppose to under international humanitarian law the chairman of the select committee make very good point and look forward to meet she later today to discuss this and other matter believe that the point that she have make be address by the fact that just as in the uk military target in israel be subject to lawyer be present in the room and legal advice that should give she some comfort on her specific point about drone target on the post conflict governance of both the west bank and gaza do the minister share with some concern that while the prime minister of the palestinian authority have resign there be still key fatah people in place he will know that in the palestinian people in gaza reject fatah and we all see where that end up on october why do he along with the united states think that fatah will be part of the albeit technocratic post conflict governance solution for both the west bank and gaza my right hon friend make an important and interesting point the new government on the west bank who have result from the resignation of the prime minister over the weekend be an interim government and many of these point can be address during the period of interim government before we move to new government on the west bank welcome the minister call publicly for israel to limit its military operation to military target in turn we should recall that hostage taking be strictly prohibit under international humanitarian law and the international committee of the red cross should be grant access to captive hold by hamas in the long term and the liberal democrats believe that israel would be more secure follow successful negotiation base on two state solution do the minister agree with we that negotiation should begin from the position that the palestinian state should be base on the border the hon gentleman make good point but he will have see from the government amendment last week that very clear process be go on very much hope that his party can support it know that the government be do everything they can to get food into gaza but we hear increase number of report of malnourishment and even starvation of adult and child will the government say to the israelis that there really be no acceptable reason to not allow food in now my hon friend be right there be no acceptable reason that be why the government be press so hard to get additional humanitarian support into not only the southern part of gaza but the northern part the minister tell the snp spokesperson the hon member for argyll and bute brendan that there need to be some balance yet the word accountability seem to be miss from his statement the uk government recognise the jurisdiction and independence of the icj which be of course investigate the alleged war crime and genocidal action of the israeli government in gaza as champion of international law and human right will the minister confirm that his government recognise that israel have an obligation to comply with the icj ruling of january and that the uk will support the court decision to issue an opinion examine the legality of the occupation on the hon gentleman first point we be very much in favour of accountability and transparency that be at the heart of the reason why both our party have be strong supporter of the international criminal court he will be aware of the legal position on the icj ruling which set out moment or two ago in attempt to build confidence for humanitarian pause we have to remember that the last time pause be negotiate hamas break it rearm and start fire again and steal the international aid that be go in to help those poor palestinians what measure will my right hon friend take to ensure that the precondition for humanitarian pause be the release of hostage that international aid actually get to the people who need it and be not divert by hamas and that hamas respect such pause my hon friend be correct he underline the great difficulty in negotiate and agree pause or ceasefire when one of the party be absolutely clear that they do not want one and that they wish to replicate the event that take place on october that be the official position of hamas what be the minister assessment of the effect of the uk abstention on last week security council vote on the us and its position we be work towards further united nations security council resolution britain be continue as it have from the start to try to bring people together behind the common position that set out early we will continue to do so in respect of future united nations security council resolution whenever we can hamas be terrorist organisation full of rapist murderer and repressor that can not be overlook at any time in these conversation the reality be that the gaza area have have hundred of million of dollar and other currency invest in it welcome my right hon friend statement and associate myself with everything in it he have talk about how the rebuilding will happen afterwards so ask he to ensure that as part of that rebuilding the aid that will need to go in be use effectively to make that area the prosperous area it can be once it be free from the tyranny of those terrorist my right hon friend set out very well one of the key aspect of the five point plan which britain be do everything we can to see implement just few week ago in debate on arm export to israel the minister for trade policy tell westminster hall we take our obligation in this space exceptionally seriously as have show before we have act to change policy in relation to change circumstance on the ground official report december vol the circumstance be tragic and brutal and crystal clear to anyone willing to see they gaza be be raze to the ground and civilian actively target potentially use the very equipment that the uk be export to israel over child have be butcher with the israel defence forces busy take selfie over the ruin and body what exactly will it take for this government to suspend arm export to israel the position that the minister set out in westminster hall be absolutely correct the government take legal advice on this matter the arm export committee do its work effectively and we will continue to act on the advice that we be give when we be give it as say last week ceasefire be contract between two side that be oversee by third party neither side be agree to ceasefire right now nor be there third party in place to oversee it be happy to say today that want ceasefire and the step to get we there and also want parliament to speak with single voice which be so much more powerful than our table motion that we then divide the house on speak with one voice will require consensus and compromise so before we risk repeat last week fiasco that see tension rise invite the minister as he have allude to in his remark to quietly bring together the opposition party at no to see whether consensus line can be agree to avoid this house return to the circus we see last week thank the former chairman of the defence committee for his wise and sensible approach as say early to both the shadow foreign secretary and the snp spokesman if we study carefully the government amendment that be table in the snp debate last week we see very substantial degree of agreement we must try very hard to build on that so that the house speak with one voice as my right hon friend say it have be three month since the pause between and november and at that point the aid could not reach people because of the infrastructure challenge today those infrastructure challenge have escalate and certainly pause would not serve to get that aid into the place it need to go why will the minister not review his position in light of the fact that to date it have not achieve what it need to ensure that humanitarian aid reach all the people who need it that will require ceasefire will it not the hon member accurately set out the fact that what be hop for some week and month ago have not be realise but that should merely incentivise we to redouble our effort to get the necessary aid and support into gaza would point out that jamie mcgoldrick the highly experienced un resident co ordinator say over the weekend that he hop it will be possible for the united nations to return to khan younis when military operation end there that show that the situation be dynamic and we be do anything we can to move with it to achieve the result that she and both want give the humanitarian situation in gaza what do the minister think be stop hamas release the hostage to some extent my hon and gallant friend answer his own question deal with an organisation such as hamas be extraordinarily difficult as we have see over recent week and month have the government of israel yet share with his majesty government their purport evidence of united nations relief and works agency complicity in the attack of october and if so when do they do it the review of unrwa as the right hon member may know be be conduct first and foremost by the independent un office of internal oversight services and secondly catherine colonna the former french foreign minister be engage in write separate report it be to both those two organisation that the evidence be require to be deliver few would deny israel right to self defence but the ongoing event in gaza be difficult to stomach can the minister please confirm to the house that everything possible be be do with our international partner to demand israeli restraint yes the minister make great play in his statement of say that we also announce million of new funding for the united nations sexual and reproductive health agency in response to an appeal for the occupied palestinian territories how can he compare that million figure with the amount of money that uk company be benefit from in arm sale that be slaughter thousand of child as the hon gentleman will know we have triple our aid to the occupied palestinian territories while it may seem like relatively small figure we be careful guardian of british taxpayer money and we spend it on what we know we can do effectively he will understand from the position that exist at the moment on the west bank and in gaza the difficulty of make these subvention really count on the ground but he will also understand the great need for they can the minister understand that some of we who be call for an immediate ceasefire now be do so against the backdrop of the horrific loss of innocent innocent israelis and palestinians our previous strategy from november of get hostage out and get aid in through humanitarian pause which support have not work that be why we be advocate for new strategy the world be look to the united kingdom to lead at the security council so can the united kingdom now lead and get that ceasefire and ensure as part of that motion that religious place of worship be protect if that be not include give what we see with the storming of al aqsa that would kick thing off again please can we ensure that there be an immediate ceasefire and as part of the security council resolution that all place of worship be protect especially as we be come into ramadan passover and easter we can not will ceasefire unless both the protagonist be willing to endorse it that be why britain have argue consistently that the first thing to do be to get humanitarian pause so that we can get the hostage out and humanitarian aid in and then build on that towards ceasefire that be the right thing to do in these circumstance as far as the next united nations security council resolution be concern we be do everything we can to ensure that we make the progress the house quite rightly want to see we have hear detail of the most appalling humanitarian situation in rafah with palestinian civilian survive on weed animal feed and even birdseed have the uk government seek or secure any assurance that israel will not launch ground invasion of rafah the hon lady will know that we be not in control of event we have give our very strong advice and view and the voice of this house will have be hear on the specific point she make thank the minister for his statement and welcome the fact that the uk be now promise more humanitarian support for woman and girl who always bear the brunt in conflict situation around the world welcome the million of new funding for the united nations sexual and reproductive health agency but what be we do to make sure that the money actually get out of the agency and down to the ground to help the thousand of woman who he say be wait to give birth my hon friend accurately identify the need and we be seek through this small but vital amount of money to meet as much of that need as we practically can give she and the house the commitment that if there be in due course the opportunity to do more on this front we will certainly do it while over million people continue to starve the aid deliver to gaza over this month fall by half compare with january the minister speak about want to see more aid reach gaza to alleviate the humanitarian nightmare that palestinians face but he be clearly ignore report from human rights watch that israel be block aid to gaza that be in direct contravention of the icj instruction for israel to ensure the delivery of aid to gaza do the minister not see the huge flaw in argue for more aid to gaza at the same time as he refuse to endorse the icj interim ruling it be the government refusal to back one of the world high court that have give the israeli government the diplomatic cover they need to prevent aid from reach gaza the effort to get aid and supply in through rafah be ongoing the hon member will be aware of the great difficulty there have be in get aid in through rafah because of demonstration there because of bottleneck and because of restriction that be why britain have be push for the large number of entry point so that the aid that be available in the area can be get through those entry point to relieve people who be in the desperate need that he so eloquently sum up it go without say that aid be only of any use if it actually reach the civilian population that need it and there be evidence that hamas be misappropriate up to of humanitarian aid enter gaza which be part of their long term pattern of prioritise their fighter abuse aid to produce rocket and use construction material to build hundred of mile of terror tunnel for their activity do my right hon friend share my concern that hamas be flagrantly disregard the humanitarian need of the civilian population in gaza and that there can be no peace and no two state solution until they lose control of gaza my hon friend could not have put it well there be absolutely no doubt whatsoever that hamas do not care at all about the suffering and the humanitarian need that exist in gaza and at no point have they show any understanding of what be happen as result of their use the population of gaza as human shield for their vile activity will the uk continue to sell arm to israel result in few innocent civilian lose their life in gaza have set out the fact that britain have the tough arm export regulation anywhere in the world minister rely upon the legal advice and other advice that accompany the work of an independent committee within government the scale of the humanitarian disaster in gaza be beyond word the times journalist amal helles have report that gaza be place now with no school no job no home and no street yet the united nations be say that the reduction in the number of food truck from january to february be apparently the average be day compare with day before october can my right hon friend share with we what progress have be make in the talk on six week pause that would surely allow more aid to get in and more hostage out our determination which my hon friend articulate accurately be to get that pause to enable the hostage to be release and to get food in that be the absolute burden of our activity as mention to the house the number of truck get into gaza be patchy on sunday truck get in but on february truck get in which be the high number since january what the house can determine from those figure be that not enough aid be get in and we need substantial increase in that number that be why the negotiation we be pursue be so important we be less than two week from the start of ramadan and the general consensus be that the ground offensive in rafah would add to an already catastrophic situation as well as the israeli operation in gaza more than people have die there be nowhere else for civilian in gaza to go will the government listen and join my constituent and many other people to say that the only way we can stop this be to have an immediate ceasefire have explain to the house why call for an immediate ceasefire will not make it happen it be the event that go with the purpose of achieve pause and then ceasefire that command the full attention of his majesty government the minister be obviously extremely well aware of the international court of justice judgment and the interim ruling that come with it he will also be aware that israel have not adhere to the requirement make by the court in that context will he tell the house exactly what military aid have be send to israel and exactly what the nature of the military co operation be and will he assure the house that no more arm will be supply to israel until that judgment be adhere to as set out to the house and to the right hon gentleman the former leader of the labour party these issue be govern by rule of law in britain and by the arrangement that set out to the hon member for inverness nairn badenoch and strathspey drew hendry the government have no plan to deviate from those the weakness in the minister statement be that it make his government commentator rather than an actor in the situation in gaza if this house and our international partner speak with one voice in call for an immediate ceasefire it would carry more weight with the government of israel if he accept that the absence of ceasefire have result in the death of ten of thousand and the horrific suffering of million palestinian civilian do he not have duty to call for ceasefire now would that make the government case strong as have set out ceasefire that collapse back into fighting within week be not in anyone interest the hon gentleman suggest that the government be spectator but nothing could be far from the truth if he look at what the foreign secretary have be do at the way britain humanitarian representative in the gulf have be act and at all the discussion that have be go on in the region and at the un he will see that britain be at the forefront of try to achieve humanitarian pause lead to sustainable ceasefire and that be what we will continue to do the foreign secretary have call for stop to the fighting now but the ministry of defence sign contract with arm manufacturer elbit systems on january that company reportedly supply up to of israel drone and land base military equipment the minister call for advice in look at how arm be export do he not agree that in light of that the uk approach appear to be deeply hypocritical what advice do he need to stop the sale of arm do not agree with that for reason that hope have set out clearly to the house only an immediate ceasefire can protect civilian and implement the icj historic plausible genocide ruling with ramadan less than day away aid agency warn that ground offensive in rafah could be catastrophic for the million people take shelter there include child if the government only call for an immediate ceasefire if and when full ground offensive in rafah begin what assessment have be make of whether they will have uphold their own obligation under international law particularly in relation to the icj provisional measure include measure around the prevention of genocide understand the passion with which the hon lady speak but simply call for an immediate ceasefire will not make it happen the good chance to stop the fighting be for an agreement in the hostage negotiation which we can then use as the opportunity to deliver full and permanent ceasefire the minister keep refer to the government amendment last week but those be just word on bit of paper in the recycle bin they could have be the resolution of this house but the government choose not to give this house that choice instead the resolution of this house be that there should be an immediate humanitarian ceasefire what message do it send to the un security council and wide international community if the government will not adopt the language that have be agree by the democratic legislature to which they be accountable namely this house of commons the hon gentleman be rewrite history last week see the leader of the house member of the government defend the right of minority party in particular the hon gentleman party from this dispatch box thank the minister for his statement and for his answer which have be helpful to everyone in the house what progress have be make to attempt to reunite the israeli hostage with their family what progress have be make to ensure that refugee who have to leave their home can stay in family group and will have access to food water and semblance of education on the hon gentleman final point we will continue to do everything we can in that respect and be grateful for his comment about my answer be helpful to the whole of the house he ask about the hostage and he will have see newspaper report over the weekend about the hostage negotiation although can not comment in any detail on those negotiation all of we be hop that they will continue to make progress ultimately to success clearly the need for humanitarian aid be desperate we be hear report of force relocation up to time and many people in gaza be reduce to eat weed and birdfeed with healthcare reduce to medieval method clearly an immediate humanitarian ceasefire be require do the minister agree that the vehicle day need to be restore as matter of urgency and that we should also look to restore and support unrwa the hon gentleman be entirely right that we need massive increase in the number of truck get into gaza he will have see that we have be work with the jordanian armed force there be drop of important humanitarian support last week and we hope very much that there will be more he will also have see that we have be work on the maritime side too meeting be go on today but the hope be that it may be possible to pre clear humanitarian aid and support that would require the use of ashdod as an entry point into israel and the government be do everything we can to facilitate that on unrwa the inquiry that the minister have tell the house about will no doubt take some time but have hobbled unrwa be undoubtedly exacerbate the humanitarian crisis that he have fully acknowledge what consideration be he give to urgently resume uk funding to unrwa as the right hon gentleman will know britain have fully fund unrwa and under our agreement with it no fund from britain be due until the next financial year can tell he that both norway and guyana have put forward additional funding in recent day that will mean unrwa be at least fully fund until the end of march development assistance for the occupied palestinian territories have already reduce from million in to million in before the suspension of unrwa funding despite question today and specific write question the government have refuse to declare what the source be for the basis of the allegation and where that source come from leave many to speculate that it be simply israeli allegation or israeli propaganda other country include ireland and spain be continue to fund unrwa will the government not ensure that unrwa funding be restore to avoid the perversity that we can find weapon and munition for ukraine but not money for humanitarian aid in gaza the hon gentleman will know that we be wait for the interim report the forensic report into collusion which the un office of independent oversight be prepare it be right to wait for that report and catherine colonna report as well as explain to the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms british funding be up to date and it will be pause until we have see those report but additional funding have be make available to unrwa as the house will accept unrwa logistical support its warehouse and vehicle be essential to the distribution of aid within gaza on unrwa funding want to follow up on his comment that we be up to date and wait on the report can he give some assurance today that the government will commit to bring back the funding what be the timescale on that the issue of british funding to unrwa do not arise until the next financial year but it be only right that we wait for the two report as say one be from the un office of internal oversight services and the other be from the former french foreign minister we be seek an interim report so that progress one way or the other can be make will the uk government take the evidence of the collective punishment in gaza with the dehumanisation of palestinians in the occupy west bank and come to the conclusion that the israeli government be authorise an oppressive regime with the goal of the complete displacement of the palestinian people no madam deputy speaker make plea to the minister to go one step far and join the chorus now include our ally in australia canada and new zealand call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire now it would send powerful message have explain to the house that no matter how desirable it might be to achieve an immediate ceasefire just call for one and willing it will not make it happen that be why the british government have set out clearly along with our ally what the necessary step be to reach the conclusion that the whole house would devoutly like to see return to the recent icj ruling as understand it one of the problem be that no country have ever respond to call for pre emptive step when the court have make such ruling part of that challenge be that no clear criterion have previously be set out for any country to meet can the minister have discussion with his counterpart about agree set of step that would be make available to country in the future so that everyone can meet their obligation the hon lady make an interesting theoretical and legal point and suggest that those discussion might go on usefully between theorist and lawyer have raise with the minister and other ministers the case of my constituent who be try to get his wife and baby daughter through the rafah crossing very frustratingly he can not get the mother on to the approve list know it be not the only case like that will the minister focus with renew urgency to press the israeli and egyptian authority to resolve these delay and make sure that these people can get through to safety my answer to the hon gentleman be yes he and have discuss the specific case as well as the general case to which he be allude can tell he that the expert in the foreign office extremely experienced in these matter be do everything they possibly can to advance that objective the horror and huge number of casualty in gaza be unfold for all the world to see alone of the three large party in this house the snp have call for an immediate ceasefire not humanitarian pause or humanitarian ceasefire we have also call for an end to collective punishment which constitute war crime and have cost life so far and leave face death by starvation our constituent be rightly outraged regardless of the minister personal view do he share my concern that members of this house have be deny recorded vote to express their view on these life or death matter which be what our constituent want to see without revisit the event of last week have no doubt of the worry of our constituent to which the hon lady refer that be why set out at the beginning why think the british government position as articulate in the content of the amendment that fail to move last week command widespread support among our constituent although it be not vote on as she rightly say the amendment set out the government position which think should be widely support among our constituent some of child under the age of two be malnourished in rafah note that in the minister statement he express concern about the prospect of military incursion but rafah can not happen the consequence would be unbearable will the minister go far and do everything he can with the international community to prevent the rafah invasion from occur on the hon lady first point she be right about the degree of malnutrition and that be why britain be work closely with unicef and the world food programme she set out the huge humanitarian consequence of military attack on rafah and she will have see what the prime minister foreign secretary and have say about the danger of that the possibility of an end to the killing whatever we call it bring hope in gaza israel and indeed here but fear that division in our community will remain many constituent have write to upset at the difference they see in how palestinian life palestinian dignity and islamophobia be value in comparison with israeli life israeli dignity and antisemitism can the minister go some way to perhaps address those concern by condemn for example the israeli ministers and other who have rule out palestinian state will he condemn the occupation as well as settler violence will he condemn the israeli soldier who film themselves pose on the bicycle of dead gazan child or rifle through the clothe of dead gazan woman let make it clear as the prime minister have that in our country there be no tolerance whatever for antisemitism or islamophobia reiterate that at the hon lady request across the dispatch box she ask about the importance of ensure that all life be treat equally and whether we care deeply about all those who be suffer in this conflict let assure the house that we do in response to my many write question the government continue to say that they be keep arm export licence under review include with regard to international humanitarian law and they confirm that ministers be able to amend suspend or revoke licence as circumstance require one of the licence currently in place allow in my constituency to manufacture component for the kind of fighter plane use by the israel defence forces in gaza will the minister publish the detail of any review that have take place will he tell we what threshold the government be wait to be cross before they will suspend or revoke licence while there be risk that they be be use to commit or to facilitate serious violation of international humanitarian law will look into the burden of what the hon lady have say if she table write question on precisely that point today will give she the government answer the situation in rafah be at critical juncture disease and famine be set in and million of palestinians have nowhere else to go after be tell by the israeli government to move south the very place where the israeli government be now threaten military action for their own safety so far the israeli government have remain belligerent in the face of international pressure to show restraint beyond word of advice and to express deep quote the minister what will be the response from the british government if israel decide to launch ground offensive in rafah the hon lady ask theoretical question what can tell she be that the british government be work together with our ally through the united nations and our friend and contact throughout the region to advance the situation in the way set out in my statement that be to try to ensure that there be humanitarian pause which enable we to get the hostage out and to get aid and humanitarian relief in lead to sustained ceasefire that must be the right thing to seek to achieve and that be what the government will continue to attempt to do it have be suggest that if what israel have do in gaza become the accept standard of self defence that core principle which be mean to protect we all and be at the core of the international world order on which democracy be found be greatly undermine how do the minister respond to that an unprecedented set of calamity have take place reiterate that israel have the absolute right of self defence but must remain within international humanitarian law it be important to hang on to those principle as we navigate this catastrophe like member across the house have have hundred of email from concerned constituent who be horrify by what they be see in gaza in particular by scene in hospital where child have be operate on without anaesthetic will the minister outline what specific step the uk government be take to ensure that people from gaza can get the medical treatment they so badly need we be act at every level to achieve the result that the hon lady and both want that be see in the work we be do internationally in the region to try to facilitate the entry of medicine our work with the jordanian government to make air drop which include medical equipment and our support for medical charity some of which be base in gaza in every way we be try to alleviate the suffering to which she so eloquently refer as we approach the five month mark of this horrific conflict nearly palestinians have die and child in gaza be die of starvation diplomatic effort must yield result before thousand more die it will be ten of thousand if the rafah offensive go ahead do the minister agree that time be of the essence and that unless there be ceasefire now there will not be deal to make the statement that the hon gentleman make and the question he ask underline the importance of the international community and britain work with our ally to double and redouble effort to ensure that we reach the situation that have set out before the house on number of occasion this afternoon of course an end to the threat of bombardment be the crucial step but the humanitarian situation remain catastrophic what specific assessment have uk official make of the allegation against the un relief and works agency with view to properly fund that organisation whose infrastructure and capacity be crucial to meet the basic everyday need of hundred of thousand of innocent man woman and child the hon lady underline the centrality of unrwa in gaza it have the necessary asset which be essential for the delivery of aid and humanitarian relief that be why we be urge the un office of internal oversight services to produce an interim report look into the collusion that allegedly take place as soon as we have that report along with the report from the former french foreign minister we will be able to make the necessary disposition not only about unrwa but about how we get essential aid and support into gaza call sir oliver my right hon friend will be aware that the taking of hostage and particularly civilian hostage be consider an abomination it be war crime do he agree that one of the thing that be drive the israelis on be desperate desire to get their people home and that anything that can be do diplomatically to try to make that happen to get the hostage back would really help the effort for peace my right hon and learn friend be absolutely right the taking of hostage be an abomination that be why we be do everything we can to ensure that the hostage be release include the two british hostage and other with close connection with the united kingdom he will have see the report both from paris and from qatar over the weekend which indicate that every sinew be be bent to try to get the hostage back order detect some unrest on the snp benches when call the right hon and learn member for north east hertfordshire sir oliver heald the right hon and learn gentleman have be here for the whole of the statement he choose to come in at this point and give he permission to do so there be absolutely nothing wrong with that let we make certain that we adhere properly to the rule as member know that will as we seek to tackle the rise in the evil of racism of all kind in our community in response to the tragedy unfolding in israel and gaza be it not vital that we distinguish between on the one hand the awfulness of the netanyahu regime and their outrageous action and on the other hand the decency of the israeli people and the right of israel to exist yesterday my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey meet yair lapid the leader of yesh atid the liberal party of israel he be former and hope future prime minister of israel who support two state solution and desire peace be the government keep in close contact with israeli opposition leader who seek peaceful resolution the hon gentleman will have see that the foreign secretary have recently be in israel as have many other member of the government include the attorney general we have close relationship with many people across the political spectrum in israel he will also be aware that israel be rumbustious democracy in region where there be not many democracy and there be divergence of view among senior people in israel that be reflect in what we hear from israel today note the minister early remark on the topic but amnesty international uk be call for the uk government to suspend the supply of arm to the israeli authority give that serious violation amount to crime under international law be be commit will he accept the moral case for do that will he revisit his policy will he also recognise that the killing of child do show clear evidence of collective punishment the early part of the hon lady question underline the fact that these issue should not be resolve at the whim of ministers but through the arm export committee which be both independent and legally advise it be the tough regime in the world and ministers should look to it for guidance which we do hope the minister will agree that there be clear consensus in this house that we want an end to the horror that we be see in gaza and to the misery of the israeli family who be miss those take hostage the minister have make great deal of the fact that humanitarian pause be all that can be achieve but that it can be route to ceasefire we be hear promise noise from the talk that there may be pause in hostility while that be not enough can the minister assure we that our government will do everything they can to reflect the will of this place and the people we represent in pursue an end to the horror in gaza and the long term establishment of two state solution in the middle east can assure the hon lady her point underline the degree of agreement rather than disagreement across this house she say that the government believe that pause be all that can be achieve but that be not the case the government believe that pause will enable we to get the hostage out and aid and support in it be part of the journey towards sustainable ceasefire it be certainly not all that we believe can be achieve but it be necessary for the other thing that we want to achieve this weekend it be report that the government be finally start to withdraw support for the israeli military suspend assistance for israeli fighter jet and helicopter at raf akrotiri in cyprus and cancel plan joint exercise over the negev desert but british make arm be still be sell to the israeli military include part for jet first can the minister tell the house on what basis the government have suspend the aforementioned military assistance and secondly and relate to that will he heed the call from un expert on friday who say that arm export to israel must be suspend immediately in the light of the icj ruling on israel plausible violation of the genocide convention have set out not only the principle by which britain address the issue of arm export but the practice of what we be do in this situation be afraid have nothing to add to what have already say on that matter the minister have quite rightly remind we that as matter of international humanitarian law israel have the right to defend itself against any aggressor he also point out that that right must be exercise in compliance with international humanitarian law could he clarify the government understanding of those specific condition will he confirm that self defence can not justify attack on civilian population who pose no threat to anyone will he also confirm that self defence do not apply to military action that be clearly disproportionate or as president biden say last week over the top in respect of the hon gentleman latter question the position be cover by what have make clear from the start of this statement israel have the right of self defence under international law but it must be conduct within international humanitarian law that be that context that have reiterate and it answer his latter two question yesterday the un report that very little humanitarian aid have enter gaza this month have reduce by compare with january the commissioner general say that the obstacle to aid get in be lack of political will regular closing of the two crossing point and insecurity due to military operation and the collapse of civil order with increase hunger and disease in gaza why do the minister not agree with and my constituent that we need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire or be there lack of political will by his government for that too we be work towards precisely that humanitarian pause upon which we can build on get extra food and support the hon lady will have see that we have be work closely with jordan and the world food programme on convoy that have leave the jordan border we be do everything we can use our taxpayer money and our humanitarian expertise to drive forward the common aim that she and both wish to achieve arm sale from the netherlands to israel have be halt after the netherlands court find that there be clear risk that component be use to commit or facilitate serious violation of international humanitarian law the court highlight evidence of israel deliberate disproportionate and indiscriminate attack failure to warn civilian and incriminate statement by israeli commander and soldier do that clear court ruling not make nonsense of the minister claim that the uk have the tough arm export licence control in the world if the uk do not stop sell arm to israel will it not also be complicit in breach of humanitarian law do not agree with that analysis we have to look at the small print of how our arm export restriction and operation work in order to see that that be not the case have set out clearly the way in which the arm export regime work and be afraid have nothing to add palestinians desperately need aid so which organisation be the government work with to replace the humanitarian effort of the un relief and works agency while it be unfunded especially if there be ceasefire or pause can he assure the house that not penny of uk funding be still reach the hand of the terrorist who commit the october atrocity and who still hold hostage unrwa be not unfunded as set out britain have fund it until the next financial year set out how other country be also produce the necessary funding the hon gentleman ask who else we work with apart from unrwa we work very closely with unicef the world food programme and the egyptian red crescent as see on my relatively recent visit to cairo we continue to explore every possible way not just through unrwa of get aid and support into gaza the government continue to be selective when they deploy the language of war crime to different conflict around the world notably it be use in ukraine freely but not in reference to what be happen in gaza in refuse to endorse the interim ruling of the international court of justice what assessment have the minister make of the wide implication for rule base international order surely if international law be to have value it must be apply universally not selectively britain have be at the heart of build the international rule base system since the hon gentleman should give credit to that when it come to the different conflict to which he allude the british government have uniform way of support international humanitarian law support the rule of war and do everything we can to stand up for the international rule base system the un have say this week that famine stalk gaza especially in the north where aid have not reach people since more than month ago on january the un have confirm that its inquiry into unrwa will not report until april on number of occasion the minister have say that the issue of funding do not arise until the next financial year so if we reach the next financial year and the report have not be issue how will the government decide whether we should re fund unrwa and what evidence have they see directly to suggest that we should not fund it now the hon member be right on the timing of the report by the un office of internal oversight services but we be hop for an interim report and the report of the former french foreign minister to inform any decision that we make it be important to make clear that unrwa have sufficient fund to get it to the end of march at least thank to the action of norway and guyana do the minister agree with the international court of justice finding that there be plausible risk that israel have be commit genocide against the palestinian people and just what will his government do about it it be hard to overestimate the offence cause by the extraordinary rhetoric of accuse israel of be guilty of genocide give the antecedent and event that take place in the holocaust during the war and the fact that more jewish people be murder on that one day of october than at any time since the end of the second world war it be now one month since the international court of justice rule that there be plausible risk that israel action in gaza be in breach of the genocide convention since then more palestinians have be kill food and essential aid be still be prevent from get into gaza and now israel be threaten to invade rafah give israel obvious breach of the court legally bind ruling what conversation have the foreign office have with the trade secretary about suspend arm sale to israel and should that not now be what be happen whether right or wrong the analysis that the hon gentleman put before the house underline the importance of the initiative that britain have take and the work that be be do both regionally and internationally at the united nations to try to secure sustainable ceasefire through pause so that we can get the hostage out and also get necessary support and humanitarian aid in hope that he will share with common view that on drive forward those initiative the five point plan that have be set out so clearly by the prime minister and the foreign secretary be the right way to address the very serious difficulty to which he allude we have hear many time about israel right to defend itself in fact the minister start his statement by reiterate israel right to defend itself on sunday evening in gaza city the israel defence forces fire on palestinians who be wait for food aid truck to arrive ten be kill do the minister believe that that be legitimate act of self defence unlike the other force involve in this dreadful conflict israeli soldier and member of the idf be teach as part of their basic training about international humanitarian law as mention there be lawyer embed in the military force as they make decision on action that be not something that we see in other force in the region and non state actor although all death be to be regret we underline that international humanitarian law be very clear that all party must respect it we be deeply concerned about the lack of humanitarian access and we be deeply concerned about the protection of civilian as set out in my early remark we believe that last week government amendment which be not move but be table outline set of circumstance that everyone across the house should be able to support that conclude proceeding on the statement we have take rather long than usual for statement but have deliberately allow this matter to run on to make sure that everybody who wish to have their voice hear be hear on point of order madam deputy speaker in response to question from the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands the minister say that the arm export committee do its work effectively however that committee formerly know as the committees on arms export controls no long exist it last meet publicly in december and last month its responsibility be transfer to the business and trade committee which will scrutinise arm export alongside huge number of other matter that mean that contrary to what the minister suggest this house no long have committee specifically focus on scrutinise arm export what advice can you give on ensure that the government take seriously the scrutiny of arm export give the minister apparent lack of understanding the hon lady know that that be not point of order for the chair but continuation of the discussion she ask for advice on how the matter might be draw to the government attention think can call on the minister to make point far to that point of order far to that point of order madam deputy speaker the structure of these matter be approve by the house of commons the regime be clear no matter where responsibility for it sit and it be believe among the tough to be find anywhere in the world that conclude matter on this subject high education student finance and skills shortages motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require the secretary of state to publish proposal for scheme in which graduate of specified university course may be exempt from requirement to repay student loan in full or in part provide that they be employ in the united kingdom in relevant sector for minimum time period and for connected purpose with your permission madam deputy speaker before start would like to take the opportunity to echo mr speaker condolence to family and friend on the passing of lord patrick cormack he be in this place for year and be bear in great grimsby my constituency it be my belief that good quality legislation aim at educational reform should not only encourage rise level of attainment in both education and skill but be design to develop the workforce of the future there have be numerous skill gap and skill mismatch report over the past few year and the path be clear for we to review how high education particularly undergraduate and postgraduate funding police can ensure that the government provide excellent public service in the uk that help to keep the country healthy improve productivity and grow the economy before become an mp work in further and high education for year and believe that have an insight into what motivate student to study to degree level and beyond in my opinion in too many case the current funding regime encourage people to study at degree level when it be not suit to the student skill and ability or future career path that be because we live with the effect of new labour high educational reform and in particular the way that the student loan system work the policy of increase the percentage of people who go to university regardless of what they study have lead to huge growth in poor quality degree that have little academic rigour the loss of excellent vocational high education course such as high national diploma which be directly relevant to the sector they be aim at and graduate skill mismatch in the uk that be now so large that we import thousand of graduate from abroad which mean that other country lose their highly skilled graduate to the uk in addition if uk graduate emigrate we lose any taxpayer benefit from fund their course or receive their outstanding student fee the learning and work institute have indicate that the uk skill shortage will cost the country billion by and that there will be shortfall of appropriately million skilled worker in our economy the annual cost to the treasury of funding undergraduate and postgraduate course in england alone be estimate at billion graduate be expect to start pay proportion of their tuition fee and maintenance grant which be mean test only once they earn an annual income over threshold that range between and we need new student loan system that will incentivise student to study the degree that we need rather than proliferation of degree that do not give the country or the individual any add value and also delay that individual entry into productive career research finding from the institute for fiscal studies and moneysupermarket show that uk student debt amount to more than billion and be project to hit trillion by currently only of all graduate pay back their student loan in full and be project never to do so the ifs also estimate that of student would have be well off if they have not go to university which prove that their degree do not add value to their career the open university business barometer report show that despite our have large graduate workforce than ever before of large organisation face skill shortage in their workforce moreover datum from the british medical association suggest that of doctor who train for employment in the nhs leave after complete their foundation year that mean loss of per student doctor cost the taxpayer million year the government offer bursary for doctor and dentist in the final year of their study to help they with tuition fee and living cost but at that stage they be already earn wage this be back to front funding model that do not help we to recruit doctor and dentist to the nhs and maintain they there there be also gap in wide range of other public sector service our local authority for instance lack social worker speech and language therapist and physiotherapist let suggest solution should like the secretary of state for education to investigate the possibility of introduce what be call the british gradforce agreement the model would be similar to system that have work well for decade in the armed force candidate can apply for scholarship and bursary fund by the relevant armed force on the understanding that they will then complete minimum term in order to pay back to the country in year of service the investment that the taxpayer have make in they candidate who drop out or be remove before the end of that period be generally expect to pay back not only the bursary but their training cost the system benefit capable and commit student from more disadvantaged background reward they with no debt in return for their public service the government should use their publish skill shortage research to create public sector graduate skill shortage list so that public sector employer could accredit course that be directly link to skill shortage in particular role the course would need to meet the quality threshold require by organisation such as the quality assurance agency for higher education and professional body university run those course could then apply for they to be accredit by the government make they eligible for the british gradforce agreement funding policy student apply for and then start to study on the relevant course could opt to sign an agreement in which they commit themselves to complete their study to the require employment standard and to work in the relevant sector for the specify timescale appropriate to their course in return for that service commitment the government could choose to write off their student loan fee up to maximum amount over the specify length of service in that profession we need policy that incentivise student to choose the degree that the country need by differentiate the funding model for those degree from those for all other type of degree the change be propose could have positive and pivotal effect on the high education sector they could encourage student to choose the course that the country need reduce the debt burden of those student be well deal for the taxpayer and help to improve growth and productivity hope that the secretary of state can investigate the possibility of such policy question put and agree to order that

able to name everyone but pay tribute to in particular my right hon friend the members for bromsgrove sir sajid javid and for newark robert jenrick my late right hon friend the former member for old bexley and sidcup james brokenshire and my hon friend the member for redditch rachel maclean all of whom have play such important role in prepare the ground for many of the measure before we today they have all be invaluable in help we to reach the point at which we deliver on the commitment that we make to reform system that clearly need change and give million the freedom security and control over their life that come with home ownership in its true full sense at stroke the bill will provide that great control for young people and many other it will help to reduce unnecessary stress uncertainty and waste time by reform labyrinthine system and make it well buy home especially first home must be moment of pride and celebration just reward for year of hard work careful saving sacrifice make and do the right thing for some however the dream of home ownership be realise in soar service charge rip off insurance commission and escalate ground rent overall and most infuriatingly there be sense of be leave in the dark and of system that be work against rather than for the homeowner that be bad for everyone but it be notable that first time buyer constitute nearly of leaseholder of owner occupier be age under they be the future of our property own democracy and they rightly expect and deserve to put down root and have the same stake in society as previous generation would welcome my hon friend view on that point what he have say be entirely correct have meet so many first time buyer in my constituency who be trap because they be stick in cycle of increase service charge even bad facility company be not maintain property when there be serious problem be meet representative of one of they firstport at the weekend but great many other example have be cite in the house we be deeply concerned because our constituent have sacrifice so much they have put all their investment and saving into their property but there be clearly no accountability or transparency and we hope that the bill will change that hear hear my right hon friend be absolutely right and the support that have just be express for her comment demonstrate that many of we see these issue in our constituency as she say it be vital that we give people who have make such sacrifice in order to achieve first time home ownership the right to and the great control over that ownership in my constituency victoria avenue harvest grove management company seem to be extort money from leaseholder and not provide any of the work that it say it be provide it be take they to court and charge they for the benefit of have letter send to they with invoice through this bill we desperately need to redress the balance between freeholder and leaseholder will the minister see that that be the case my hon friend be absolutely right he make very important point about transparency which be at the heart of the service charge change in the bill he make an extremely important point about fairness not all company will be do thing that be incorrect but where they have be find to be incorrect it be important that they shoulder their own cost thank the minister for his generosity with his time it be not only company that be exploit leaseholder the st mary magdalene and holy jesus trust in my constituency refuse to allow its leaseholder to extend their lease or buy their freehold the charitable exception be very complex and nobody want historic house to be sell but these be ordinary terrace house and the charity use to sell the freehold and indeed extend leasehold in the past be it possible for the minister to meet or my constituent to look at how this issue can be address in the future be grateful to the hon lady for outline that issue know she have raise it in this place before as she indicate this be complex area of law but be happy to talk with she separately on that matter in the come week if it be helpful how be we do this we be give leaseholder more security over the future of their home by increase the standard lease extension term to year by make it cheap and easy for leaseholder to buy their freehold and by tackle unfair charge exploitative practice and poor management in do so we be overturn century of iniquity the bill will also give leaseholder the control they deserve over the building they live in at present management company be too often unaccountable to those who pay for they mean that they be able to charge excessive fee for poor quality service the bill give more leaseholder the opportunity to manage the building themselves so that work get do properly and they have more of say the minister might anticipate the question be go to ask because have ask it before it be fine give leaseholder easy way to buy their freehold until we come across company such as coppen estates which we have debate before it just do not reply to letter think that we be now on our third record delivery letter to the company about the resident on the flockton estate who have just be send enhance bill for their ground rent charge with no justification they face threat if they do not comply where in the bill be there any measure to make sure that coppen estates and the like respond properly in future or face consequence if they do not be grateful to the hon gentleman as he know we have debate the iniquity of coppen estates extensively and repeat that it be treat my constituent in way that be inappropriate in the same way that it be do with his constituent over the border give that we be extend the opportunity for charge to go to tribunal hope that the hon gentleman constituent in flockton will be able to go to tribunal and hold that company or other company to account should that be helpful through the reform we will scrap the presumption that leaseholder must pay their freeholder legal cost even when they win at tribunal correct another historical and unfair imbalance someone would not be expect to pay legal cost if they be successful in their claim in other case so leaseholder should not be treat any differently the minister be most accommodate throughout the proceeding in committee and we be all grateful to he for the way in which he have listen far to the point raise by my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts the minister will know that many developer have locate themselves extrajudicially in place such as the cayman islands wembley central apartments ltd in my constituency have finally end up there as have many other what in this bill will enable we to extend our reach and force such company to respond reply and do what the building safety act already say they ought to do the hon gentleman make an important point which know we debate in committee he correctly highlight the challenge in certain area of enforcement if may will come back to that later in the debate join my hon friend the member for brent north barry gardiner in recognise that this be not partisan issue because so many of we see the problem the minister talk about people not pay the cost when they win but many will be shock to discover that no precedent be set at leasehold tribunal we see company exploit our constituent time and again and it create no precedent on which the court and the tribunal court could draw will he look at my amendment it seek to set that precedent and give people the protection of know that freehold manager who have mistreat people will not be able to do it with impunity because the court will be able to take that into consideration if tribunal have find that to be the case be grateful to the hon lady and know that she feel strongly about this matter and have raise it previously be always happy to talk outside the chamber but the advice have receive be that at the high tier of the tribunal there be the ability to give an indication of the direction of travel and precedent can be set there as say be happy to

cost of the relevant step be meet when make remediation contribution order or remediation order it be often the case that do survey or investigative work to discover the full extent of remediation require on building take time money and effort and those assessment can be invasive new clause would place it beyond doubt that the first tier tribunal have the power to order that respondent must arrange and pay for evaluation survey or expert report to establish the full extent of building defect on new clause we know that in some instance landlord of building that be metre high or above be fail to provide alternative accommodation for leaseholder when they be decant from their home this new clause would place it beyond doubt that in addition to relevant step and expert report the cost of alternative accommodation for leaseholder and other resident who be decant from their home can be recover through remediation contribution order on new clause resident management company and right to manage company allow leaseholder to have more control over their building however such management company be unable to fund litigation against non compliant landlord as they be unable to recover the cost for do so from leaseholder in their building this new clause would allow such management company where the relevant lease allow to raise fund for remediation contribution order make sure that we continue to hold those responsible for life threaten defect to account new clause would repeal section of the building safety act which be intend to allow for the recovery of remediation cost relate to residential building that be metre high or above in an insolvency and for these fund to be use to remediate the building however there be conflict with insolvency law and risk that instead of be use for remediation any sum recover under section could be direct to pay down the debt this problem can not easily be remedied so we be seek to repeal the section at this time new clause propose that regulator need to be make aware if those responsible for relevant building that is responsible person become insolvent this new clause introduce duty on insolvency practitioner to notify local fire and rescue authority local authority and where necessary the building safety regulator also want to speak to new clause to new schedule and and amendment we know that there be little justification for sell house on leasehold basis for year developer have exploit the sale of house on leasehold basis for the sole purpose of generate an income stream from ground rent and fee this have be do at the expense of consumer who receive little or no benefit in return we promise to shut down this abusive practice by ban the sale of house on leasehold basis and today we be do so other than in narrow circumstance where lease can still be justify all new house will need to be sell on freehold basis be really grateful for this news from the minister it certainly go long way towards address my new clause he speak specifically about ban leasehold sale of new house but what consideration will he give to extend that ban to leasehold flat know that that be concern for number of we on both side of the house know that my right hon friend have campaign extensively for the ban on leasehold house as many in this chamber have do and she have speak up in this place on the issue before be grateful for her support for it she also rightly talk about the extensive debate about the potential extension of the ban to flat the secretary of state have say at this dispatch box on numerous occasion that the government remain keen to make progress on find an alternative workable solution to leasehold flat most people in this place recognise that that will probably be commonhold and work will continue on that we hope to make further progress on that in the future rise commonhold have clearly create significant amount of interest thank my hon friend for give way and for what he be say there be certain building company in this country bellway homes for example whose policy be to sell the leasehold to leaseholder and sell the freehold to company that then exploit every aspect of the freehold without even inform the leaseholder that they have do this surely we can close this loophole we could close it this afternoon by ensure that the freeholder must give the leaseholder the first right of refusal to purchase the freehold my hon friend raise an important point know that it be cover in an amendment put down by the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts and will come to it later in the debate on the point make by the hon member for harrow east bob blackman bellway be certainly company that have do this indeed many people do not even realise that they have leasehold house and only find out quite while afterwards when all the cost start to come down the road welcome what the government have do but we must try to find good solution for everybody who now find themselves in this position because in the year to come those house could become very difficult to sell the right hon gentleman make an important point about the need to ensure that this regime work we recognise that there be challenge which be why we be bring forward number of measure on the point about exist contract that have be sign by people purchase leasehold property be it the government view that those be legitimate contract and that there be therefore risk in try retrospectively to reverse the condition of those contract or be it the government view that those be abusive contract and that there be therefore public policy interest in retrospectively eliminate the leasehold element of they hope that will be able to answer my hon friend question in moment when run quickly through our amendment we be ban the sale of leasehold house in all but unusual circumstance but for those that be out there at the moment there must be an ability to ensure that they can buy the freehold and move from the leasehold challenge to freehold let deal with some specific that hope will answer some of the question that have be raise new clause ban the grant of new long lease of house it will cover both newly build house and exist freehold house where the owner attempt to grant new long lease this new clause also close potential loophole by prevent the late sale of lease where circumstance have change between the date the lease be grant and the date it be assign for example this will thwart developer from grant lease of vacant land to sister company build house on the land and then sell what be now leasehold house new clause set out the broad condition for what property will be capture by the ban each of these broad condition be then define in the subsequent four clause new clause and specify what constitute long leasehold interest for the ban it adopt the establish definition in law which be familiar to developer and home owner alike new clause set definition in law of house for the purpose of this legislation this be broad definition that should reflect what prospective buyer would rightly consider to be house the definition will also capture attempt to create minor interdependency between two property which developer might create to get around the ban new clause confirm what residential lease be it provide that long lease of property will be residential lease if the lease do not prevent use as separate dwelling again this be broad definition design to prevent the mis selling of leasehold house and capture only lease of property use as house we recognise that in limited number of case the use of lease can still be justify for the purpose of this bill we be call they permit lease we have consult widely on what should and should not be exempt from the ban and even on the question of what be and be not house for these purpose the result be the collection of definition now detail in new schedule to the bill these exemption will allow vendor to continue to sell long lease on house where the use of lease can be justify this include land where property can not be sell on freehold basis such as inalienable national trust land or where the product rely on lease connect to an active third party such as share ownership house or community land trust we be able to and we will if need be revisit these definition and exemption if innovation in the housing market require it or if we see evidence of poor behaviour new clause would create an additional layer of protection for consumer and clarify which lease be permit usually when developer intend to sell number of new lease of house on the same site those who intend to grant or sell lease that fall into one of the category set out in part of the schedule will be require to make an application to the appropriate tribunal for determination on whether the propose lease be permit this include house sell on land lease before the government announce their intention to ban leasehold house in december and lease such as retirement house lease or those on inalienable national trust land to add further clarity for consumer and subsequent buyer the tribunal will grant certificate confirm that the lease be permit and under which category critically this must happen before the lease be market so that the potential buyer can proceed with the purchase with confidence know that the house be exempt from the ban this relate to the point make by the right hon member for alyn and deeside mark tami not many development will need to go through this process but those operate where it be not always clear whether lease be permit or require will have to do so to ensure that consumer have access to the material information they need and that they have the confidence to make decision when purchase new house new clause require those propose to sell new lease of house to make this clear when market the property to ensure that vendor comply with the new marketing requirement this measure will rely on new clause to implement new penalty regime this include fine for fail to provide the require marketing information at the right time we know that not all home buyer will read the detail of all the marketing information and that not all lease will be advertise so new clause introduce warning notice so that all vendor will have to alert purchaser in write that they be enter into the lease of the house or an agreement for the lease of the house and inform they on what ground that lease be permit thank the minister for give way again one problem be that many of these company encourage buyer to use their lawyer who do not point out some of the pitfall of leasehold property the right hon gentleman be absolutely right which be why hope that measure such as new clause go some way towards make it crystal clear that there be no way to get around this and towards provide clarity to those who seek to buy new property new clause will require statement on the front of all new lease declare that it be permit lease and be not long residential lease of house should developer make dishonest declaration to his majesty land registry the homeowner may be able to exercise the redress right contain in new clause which will allow they to acquire the freehold from the developer free of charge under new clause if lease do not include the prescribed statement his majesty land registry will have the power to restrict the resale of the property until the right information and declaration have be provide the minister be talk about the information on house will it also apply to flat so that before anyone buy property it must be explain to they that they be buy lease and what that entail table new clause which say that everyone buy lease should be present with copy of the government how to lease document everyone in this situation should be give independent advice be focus on home and we have be emphatic and clear that the sale of leasehold home will be preclude other than in exceptional circumstance be happy to talk to the hon gentleman both later in the debate and outside the chamber about whether further consumer protection for those purchase flat may be proportionate and reasonable new clause grant homeowner who have be mi sell new lease of house the right to acquire the freehold from the landlord as well as any superior leasehold interest in the property for zero cost new clause and set out protection and reasonable limitation on this requirement and new clause provide for the secretary of state to make regulation set out further detail on how redress can be obtain we understand that grant homeowner the right to redress alone may not be enough to prevent bad actor from attempt to breach the ban on the sale of lease on house which be why we be introduce system of financial penalty where there be breach these penalty will start at for minor breach rise to for the most serious breach to enforce this system of fine as set out in new clause we be ask all local weight and measure authority to play part where they see infraction in their area we will also set out how they need to work through new clause the chief responsibility for investigate and take action will lie with the lead enforcement authority through new clause the secretary of state will have the power to appoint the right authority to fulfil this important role while new clause detail the duty by amend the consumer rights act clause and also vest the appropriate investigatory and enforcement power essential for both the lead authority and local authority to carry out the job can the minister assist with relatively unusual issue in my constituency have listen very carefully to his helpful speech in the loddon park development on the edge of woodley in my constituency resident be sell property only to discover in the small print of their contract as my right hon friend the member for alyn and deeside mark tami say that they be expect to pay stand charge to upkeep open space on this large development even though they be freeholder of their own house will the minister look into this matter and write to about what redress might be open to they be very happy to write to the hon gentleman about the specific in addition to the building safety measure and the ban on new leasehold house the government have table number of consequential amendment to refine and improve the bill with the leave of the house will mention three key issue among the many that be bring to our attention in committee understand these issue will be subject to further debate today but want to acknowledge that they be cap exist ground rent which have already be raise leaseholder forfeiture which know will be raise and support for the resident of freehold estate which have already be extensively address know that member will have question about the government plan to address ground rent and we have consult on introduce cap on ground rent in the bill we extend the consultation on request and as result we be still consider our next step we will say more shortly the minister be generous in give way can he give we an indication of the timescale many member will be interested to know the answer and do he anticipate be able to introduce something when the bill reach the other place although can not give the specific assurance that my right hon friend seek we be try to work through this at speed we recognise that it be an important issue and we recognise that it be vital to today discussion know that hon and right hon member will recognise that this be hugely contested area in which there have already be significant discussion people have very different view so we want to make sure that while we be move at speed we take our time so that we reach conclusive decision through the right methodology and process my constituent be in flat with ground rent of year as that be over the threshold it mean that their property can be take away from they if they fail to pay their ground rent as result my constituent have fail to sell their property six time even though they have have buyer they be stick in this flat and they can not get on with their life will the minister please look at this threshold which be cause real problem my right hon friend move on to my second point we also recognise the strength of feeling on the vexed issue of forfeiture the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook make clear case on this in committee as do other member and also hear passionate and eloquent case in committee from my hon friend the member for walsall north eddie hughes will the minister simply remove any opportunity for forfeiture it be arcane and have no place in our system strongly suspect that would get support on both side of the house the house see my hon friend passion which he demonstrate in committee and be demonstrate again today both he and my hon friend the member for redditch make passionate case in committee recognise that this be real and significant problem and there be huge iniquity at stake have hear from colleague both today and previously about why we should act and we be currently work through the detail of the issue we will report back to the house with more detail shortly finally comprehensive debate in committee on freehold estate be lead by my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller he be committed campaigner on this issue and know that many other member also have very strong view have also be involve in this in place such as alderman park and hunloke grove in my constituency we understand the strength of feeling on this issue and we be consider it far resident of estate across my constituency be trap in extortive relationship with unaccountable private management company while their estate go unadopted on second reading the secretary of state express his willingness to bring forward and consider measure to make sure that resident have the right to manage on such estate at bare minimum before consider wide action be there any reason why the government would not accept new clause in the name of the shadow minister to finally give the resident of these estate the right to manage and to get out of these extortive relationship the hon gentleman make that case in committee and be grateful to he for that and for repeat it today as say we understand the strength of feeling on the issue and be consider it far rise will give way one final time and then will conclude so that other can get in these management company that the minister allude to have literal monopoly over the resident they be mean to serve in effect they control the resident rather than the other way round so welcome the amendment make in committee to ensure that resident can change their management company will he give commitment to this house that he will ensure that those amendment stay in the bill both here and in the other place and that they will become law my hon friend have be campaigner for many year on the importance of this matter and know how strongly he feel and how much he act on it on behalf of his constituent we be absolutely committed to make progress on estate management the bill demonstrate significant step forward in do that and we will see what else we can do in the future rise be go to wind up so as to give other the opportunity to speak to sum up property ownership have be describe as one of the bulwark of individual freedom and the measure have describe today be design to give all homeowner particularly the young generation the chance to gain proper stake in our democracy the bill seek to bring great fairness transparency and accountability to the system and to give million of people across the country more secure foundation to get on in life strong stake in our society and solid platform for the future be grateful for all members effort to improve the bill and for the scrutiny and debate it have receive so far and look forward to hear the further discussion to that effect this afternoon rise order colleague will see that lot of right hon and hon member wish to contribute to this debate which have to finish at pm will want to bring the minister back for short time another deputy speaker be take over in moment but let advise that those speak from the back benches should be prepare to speak for between six and seven minute in order for we to get everybody in be afraid that that be because of the pressure on time call the shadow minister start by declare an interest my wife be the joint chief executive of the law commission whose work in this area intend to reference in my remark rise to speak to the amendment and new clause that stand in my name before do so would like to put on record my thank to all those hon member who serve on the public bill committee for so ably scrutinise the many technical and complex provision that the bill contain there be as one would expect difference of opinion and emphasis but it be also evident that there be shared recognition that the bill can and should be improve far and an unusual degree of cross party agreement as to some of the way that might be achieve despite ream of government amendment table in committee and for our consideration today this bill remain distinctly unambitious piece of legislation that be matter of deep regret to those on the labour benches not only because the government paucity of ambition will see exploit leaseholder wait even long for the current iniquitous leasehold system to be end but because it be also manifestly clear that there be widespread support across the house to go much far than this limit bill do responsibility for the fact that the bill do not contain so many of the commitment that successive conservative secretaries of state have make over recent year not least in relation to the promise widespread introduction of the commonhold tenure ultimately lie with ministers they have the opportunity to bring forward bold leasehold and commonhold reform legislation and they make political decision not to do so although the opposition appreciate the understandable desire of many leaseholder to see this bill completely revamp so that it live up to the many weighty promise make by the government since we make clear at the outset in committee that we do not intend to try to persuade ministers to radically overhaul it by mean of the many hundred of amendment that would be require to implement all the law commission recommendation on enfranchisement right to manage and commonhold that remain our position whether this bill receive royal assent or not before this parliament be dissolve labour government will have to finish the job of finally bring the leasehold system to an end by overhaul it to the last benefit of leaseholder and reinvigorate commonhold to such an extent that it will ultimately become the default and render leasehold obsolete reassure leaseholder across the country that we be absolutely determined to do so we recognise however that this limited bill will provide degree of relief to leasehold and freehold homeowner in england and wales by give they some great right power and protection over their home for that reason we be extremely pleased it will complete its passage today but we be determined to send to the other place the most robust piece of legislation that we can that mean rectify the bill remain flaw and incorporate into it select number of measure to far empower leaseholder and improve their right with that objective in mind we have table series of amendment and new clause for consideration today that they be almost identical to number of those we discuss at length in committee be deliberate choice that reflect not only the importance we place on the change they seek to secure but the distinct lack of convincing response from the minister in committee as to why the government feel they need to resist they part of the bill concern leasehold enfranchisement and extension in seek to implement the small subset of reasonable and proportionate law commission recommendation it be almost entirely uncontentious however we believe that several provision in this part be defective we seek to remedy their deficiency in committee and we have table number of amendment in an attempt to do so again amendment and concern arguably the most significant provision in this part when it come to ensure that the process of extend lease or acquire freehold be as cheap as possible for exist leaseholder namely the propose new valuation process as provide for in clause to and schedule and the current valuation method have number of manifest flaw and we fully support the new method as propose in the bill however with the applicable deferment rate become the primary driver of price to be pay in enfranchisement or extension claim under the new method as result of the abolition of marriage and hope value and the peppercorning of ground rent in the valuation calculation we believe it be essential that it be set in way that be fair to leaseholder while the government ostensibly agree there be nothing on the face of the bill to ensure that that will be the case and we therefore remain convinced that this government or future one could be lobby by vested interest to set deferment rate that will be punitive to leaseholder in resist our effort to amend the bill in committee to guard against such an outcome the minister argue that the secretary of state must have flexibility to make decision on the rate or rate we agree we be not suggest that we bind the hand of ministers by prescribe the rate or rate on the face of the bill but we do believe that the legislation should be amend to place clear obligation on the secretary of state to set rate or rate with the override objective of encourage leaseholder to acquire their freehold at the low possible cost the shadow minister be right that there be lot of consensus in committee so hope he will not mind probe he on some of the language he just use about the issue of set rate we all want to see what the government do on deferment and capitalisation rate but the shadow minister use the term punitive to leaseholder do he accept that already embed in the issue about ground rent and the change here be substantial transfer of value from freeholder to leaseholder that the people who be more likely to suffer from punitive behaviour be those who enter into contract historically from the freeholder side expect that those value would be consider and that it be public policy decision that will change the value in those contract understand the hon gentleman point which he make in committee as well if be not mistaken we very much think the risk be on the other side of the scale that is that government would be tempt to set rate that be damaging to leaseholder as result of be lobby by vested interest while there be balance to be strike we think it be right that we put on the face of the bill that the objective in set the deferment rate as part of the premium calculation must be to ensure that leaseholder acquire their freehold at the low possible cost amendment and would ensure that that be the case and commend they to the house part of the bill make change to other right of long leaseholder it contain the four clause in the bill that implement law commission recommendation on the right to manage several of which we have seek to improve as well as clause which make provision for new enfranchisement right to extinguish ground rent without have to extend lease we still have absolutely no idea how this clause or clause and for that matter will interact with any proposal that might emerge from the recently closed consultation on restrict ground rent for all exist lease the minister must provide further clarification on that it can not be right that we could be deal with such significant issue when we get to ping pong stage in due course we very much welcome the intent of clause and schedule which it give effect to even if unamended they will ensure that some leaseholder can enjoy reduce premium and secure nominal ground rent ownership of their property without the need to go through the challenge and expense of repeat lease extension however we remain unconvinced by the government propose conferral of this new right only on those leaseholder with lease with an unexpired term of more than year in resist our attempt to remove the year threshold from the bill in committee the minister essentially make two argument the first be that there be need to put finger on the scale somewhere in other word the government take the view that the new right must be restrict base on lease length the second argument be that in determine the threshold for restriction the primary consideration should be which leaseholder be unlikely to be interested in or do not need lease extension official report leasehold and freehold reform public bill committee january we do not believe that either argument be particularly strong first any long lease threshold for the new right be ultimately entirely arbitrary as evidence by the fact that the government choose different threshold from the one recommend by the law commission secondly there be principled argument that we should trust leaseholder to make decision base on what be right for they and their individual circumstance rather than deny broad category of leaseholder new statutory right on the basis that minister know well what be in their interest viewpoint that we would have assume those on the conservative benches would support as put it to the minister in committee there could be all sort of reason why someone with lease short than year might want to buy out only their ground rent include simply that they be unable to afford the premium require to secure year lease under clause and deny they that right on the ground that other leaseholder might advertently or inadvertently disadvantage themselves by use the new right to extinguish only their ground rent strike we as overly paternalistic and misguided we remain of the view that there be strong case for simply delete the year threshold entirely give that the remaining year test that apply be arbitrary and that the most common form of lease be and year amendment would do so thereby make the new right to replace rent with peppercorn rent available to all exist leaseholder commend it to the house part of the bill contain wide range of measure relate to the regulation of leasehold we have table several amendment design to strengthen the provision in it arguably the most important be amendment and new clause concern litigation cost although we support the aim of scrap the presumption that leaseholder will pay their freeholder legal cost when they have challenge poor practice we believe that in merely limit the ability of landlord to do so the government be create an incentive for freeholder to litigate in way that be likely to erode the general presumption they be seek to implement as we argue in committee far more sensible approach would be to legislate for general prohibition on claim litigation cost from leaseholder and then to provide for limited number of define exception to that general rule by mean of regulation for example in case in which the landlord be leasehold own company or in which the cost be in the opinion of the tribunal reasonably incur for the benefit of the leaseholder or the proper management of the building take together amendment and new clause would provide for that approach by leave out clause and replace it with new clause that provide for general prohibition on claim legal cost from tenant and for power to specify class of landlord who will be exempt from it commend they to the house mr deputy speaker we want to see number of other change make to the bill to provide leaseholder with well protection in law and to pave the way for commonhold future to that end we have table amendment and new clause to among other thing abolish the draconian rent charge remedy provide for by section of the law of property act provide for mandatory resident management company in new block of flat establish right to manage regime for residential freeholder on private or mixed use estate bring forward legislative option to facilitate leaseholder in new block of flat be grant an automatic share of freehold and regulate manage agent of particular importance to we be the need to ensure that the bill abolishes forfeiture and the windfall it provide to freeholder as we argue in committee forfeiture be wholly disproportionate and horrifically draconian mechanism for ensure compliance with lease agreement over the course of nearly century this house have take intermittent step to tighten the law of forfeiture yet its continue use and the chilling effect that result from its mere existence continue to put landlord in nearly unassailable position of strength in dispute with leaseholder the opposition be not suggest for moment that this house abolish the right of forfeiture in relation to residential long lease and replace it with nothing there must be effective mean of ensure compliance with lease agreement and we be more than willing to work constructively with the government to determine what alternative arrangement be need to deal with breach of covenant or unpaid arrear but forfeiture operate to the prejudice of leaseholder it can not be justify and we must use the bill finally to do away with it we believe there be broad consensus across the house for grasp the nettle and abolishing forfeiture and new clause would do so and notwithstanding the very positive noise that we hear from the minister urge hon member from across the house to support it finally let turn to the government amendment to the bill that be table last week of which be submit just before the deadline on thursday in do so feel must put on record once again the opposition intense frustration at this government continue practice of significantly amend legislation as it progress through the house the sheer volume and complexity of amendment that this government now routinely table to their own legislation represent departure from established practice and one that act as serious impediment to hon member effectively scrutinise legislation and increase the risk that act of parliament contain error that subsequently need to be remedie the government amendment that have be table for consideration today fall into three broad category namely share ownership build safety and new leasehold house will take each in turn start with shared ownership although be increasingly personally of the view that there be grow case one that be reinforce by the treatment of shared ownership in the bill for primary legislation to address various issue arise from shared ownership as tenure government amendment and which relate to it be not contentious and we support they we welcome the government decision to use the opportunity present by the bill to make number of change to the building safety act to ensure it operate effectively although the very fact that ministers be have to completely overhaul arrangement that come into force less than two year ago for example replace the regime for deal with insolvent developer and orphan building by mean of new clause and vindicate entirely the concern the opposition express back in about the way in which the then building safety bill be overhaul at pace via hundred of government amendment table in the other place which noble lords have relatively little time to consider carefully or properly scrutinise want to raise two issue of concern about the government amendment relate to build safety first new clause and expand the concept of relevant defect to which the leaseholder protection in the building safety act apply and which tribunal can order landlord to remediate although we obviously take no issue with amendment design to provide further clarification on how the act operate would be grateful if the minister could tell we why the government believe these new clause be even necessary give that the president and deputy president of the upper tribunal in the olympic village case rule that the tribunal already have the power under the act to order remedial work in respect of relevant defect where the work be design to reduce the risk pose by that defect not necessarily eliminate it completely in addition give that the government be clearly willing to act retrospectively would be grateful if the minister can tell we why they will not go far and take step to guarantee that leaseholder protection under schedule to the act apply irrespective of when service charge demand be issue thereby prevent the court of appeal from potentially overturn the november ruling of the upper tribunal to that effect the second issue concern new clause which expand the category of cost that leaseholder can seek to recover by mean of remediation contribution order and will allow for the recovery of cost associate with professional expert service and any temporary accommodation however it will not allow leaseholder in building with fire safety defect to attempt to recover the significant cost associate with soar building insurance premium which in many case will continue to be levy after remediation work have complete the government be rightly try to improve the situation in respect of insurance charge by mean of clause and will the minister tell we why they will not allow such cost to be recover via an rco of course not one of the eight government amendment that relate to build safety resolve the underlie problem with the government approach namely the detrimental impact of the decision to exclude certain category of leaseholder and building from the protection that have be afford to other under the act we therefore table new clause and which would give the secretary of state the power to bring non qualify lease and building respectively within the scope of the protection of the act commend they to the house turn lastly to new leasehold home the government be rightly mock in the aftermath of the bill publication for claim that it end leasehold on newly build house in england and wales when it contain no such provision on thursday they finally table amendment that appear to make good on their promise there be only one problem their purport ban on new leasehold house do not actually ban all new leasehold house indeed it be unlikely even to ban most of they because new schedule still allow new long residential lease of house to be create in instance where superior lease have be grant before december the minister suggest in his opening remark that the government be thereby allow the sale of new leasehold home only in unusual circumstance but they be introduce far from limited exception we literally have no idea how many undeveloped plot of land and property within they might be subject to such superior lease or how many could still be grant subject to agreement make under such term for example where developer have purchase head lease on site but have not build it out give that we know that developer routinely use intermediate lease both for financial purpose and to insulate themselves from various consumer right and protection the prevalence of such arrangement in the leasehold housing market be likely to be high as such although we understand the significance of the date in question as the moment when the policy be first announce and appreciate the need to provide for limited number of exception such as national trust property surely the government realise that the exemption provide for by new schedule be likely to render the ban meaningless and will mean that new leasehold house be still build in significant number have no doubt that the other place will have much to say about the new provision but the minister owe this house an explanation on precisely why the government have potentially afford developer means to continue build new leasehold house in significant number would be grateful if in provide that explanation he tell the house why on earth leasehold retirement property have also be exempt give the almost uniformly detrimental impact of such arrangement on old people live in those property this unambitious piece of legislation be far cry from what million of leaseholder be lead to believe would be forthcoming give the extravagant promise make by successive ministers over the past six year they nevertheless recognise as we do that this limited bill will provide they with some relief from the unjust and discriminatory practice that our archaic leasehold system facilitate for that reason they share our desire for it to receive royal assent as quickly as possible but we owe it to they to deliver the most robust piece of legislation that we can deliver we have chance today to strengthen the bill in number of important respect to rectify aspect of it that be problematic and to improve it by incorporate small number of target measure that will immediately empower leaseholder and improve their right urge the house to come together to do so rise order be sure that everybody hear madam deputy speaker request for brevity as number of members wish to get in and we have to accommodate everybody before agree with large part of what the opposition spokesperson the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook say and with nearly all of what my hon friend the minister say where disagree with the opposition spokesperson be that think the bill be ambitious in what it be try to achieve although we would all like it to go far it be quite remarkable that this be the first major bit of legislation to help leaseholder since although we have have the building safety act the fire safety act and other thing which do some thing towards that it be remarkable how few people know much about the role of residential leaseholder they own nothing but the right to live in home for period declare that be leaseholder have flat in my constituency for which there have be no problem and for which the bill will do neither harm nor good and also have another leasehold property if happen to gain from the measure would give the benefit to good cause be not here for myself be here for those who have be suffer for year wish could be at the westminster hall debate on bbc impartiality but it conflict with this debate it be now year since the peace activist and photographer tom hurndall be shoot by sniper in rafah the subsequent nine month of inquiry by the israel defence forces be shocking however will leave that to the other debate on leasehold reform believe that we have opportunity both in the house of commons and perhaps more so in the house of lords to make significant progress my hon friend the minister will point out to the consultation on permit development right that start on february towards the end of the consultation document paragraph and appear under the heading construction of new dwellinghouse on freestande block of flat that be reference to the inexplicable and disastrous town and country planning permit development and miscellaneous amendments england coronavirus regulations si no those emergency covid regulation accompany by an economic assessment of which to put it bluntly would have be ashamed be well economist allow owner landlord and freeholder of certain block to put an extra one or two storey on top without consult the exist leaseholder at all how any government let alone one support could have do that be beyond my comprehension there have be consultation some year before and the general consensus be do do it so why have it be do hope that people will look at the consultation which be open until april answer question and and give explanation of their own experience developer try to put extra floor on top of the st andrews gardens building in my constituency that be turn down flat by the local authority but its decision be overturn on appeal by the government inspector the developer then try again advertise for sale flat that do not exist even though nobody want they as they will cause significant harm my new clause which be indebted to liam spender of st david square in for draft say that the landlord or developer will have to pay compensation to leaseholder if the effect on they be harmful the minister legal adviser may say that the clause be not perfectly draft although think it be pretty good even if he can not accept it now will he go through the reply to the consultation have talk with member of all party who represent those affect and consider whether the government can bring forward in the house of lords proposal that would undo the effect of and implement some of the preferred response to the consultation to which he may not have time to refer in his winding up it be five year since we produce the select committee report on leasehold reform it come after long year of campaigning by the all party parliamentary group on leasehold and commonhold reform and particularly commend the effort of the father of the house the hon member for worthe west sir peter bottomley who have just speak my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders and our good friend jim fitzpatrick who be no long in this house but who certainly make major contribution to that to be fair to the government it be good that we have make progress on many of the item in the select committee report the caveat of course be that we probably have not go as far as we would have want or as quickly as we would have expect when the committee meet remember go into room with about leaseholder from all over the country the hon member for harrow east bob blackman who be in his place few minute ago be there as well and hear horror story of people be rip off in the sale of leasehold home by developer they be tell that there be no difference between leasehold property and freehold property they be tell that by the solicitor who work for they because the solicitor be recommend by the developer that be together with the free carpet in the living room that come as bribe that be what it be leaseholder be not aware that they would have to pay to get doorbell fit if they want one because they have to get permission or for conservatory or whatever fee the freeholder choose leaseholder be tell that they could within couple of year buy the freehold at fix price from the same developer the problem of course be that by the time leaseholder come to inquire about purchase the freehold the freehold have be sell to another party there be lot of example of that which be why have an amendment new clause that want to push to vote although hope the minister will accept it it be simple amendment to say that before the sale of freehold the right of first refusal have to go to the exist leaseholder that right already exist for leaseholder in flat but not for leaseholder in house why be that that really can not be justify or even explain will the minister accept just that one simple amendment it would give leaseholder that right and stop freeholder we know that this happen who want to evade the legislation include the improvement the government be bring in pass property around from one organisation to subsidiary to third party with view to evade the legislation so that leaseholder never know where to go to get the relevant freeholder to agree to the sale my hon friend be make an excellent speech do he agree that part of the problem be that some of the freeholder be base overseas and it be extremely difficult for leaseholder to track they down this be an ongoing issue that hope the government will look into absolutely hope the minister will have look at the whole issue of freeholder who will not respond that certainly apply to many who be overseas with whom it be very difficult to get in touch will not press new clause to the vote but the purpose of it be to say to the minister that the default answer can not be that the leaseholder can always go to tribunal most leaseholder be simply ordinary resident try to get on with their life who think it ought to be fairly easy to put in request get calculation do and buy their freehold they be not ready for these organisation with all their lawyer and surveyor that want to evade this and try to hide away in some case overseas so that they can not be contact can the minister look at that issue know he be aware of it because we share the same problem with coppen estates there be other that be base overseas but this one be base in semi board up shopfront with letterbox that never seem to be open that be the sort of company we be deal with they be small organisation that make living out of charge ground rent from leaseholder who can not exercise their enfranchisement because of the attitude and evasion of the freeholder concern hope that the minister will have another look at that issue the other amendment have table be about have professional qualification and some form of regulation of property manager the government have legislate to say that the manager of social housing will need professional qualification in future but what be the difference between manager of social housing and property manager of leasehold block in some way there may be great complication in try to manage multitude of different leaseholder than people who have secure tenancy in council or housing association block of flat what be the difference why will the government not recognise that there be some good property manager who be well qualified experienced and can be hold to account but other who be not like that indeed some be put in place for that purpose they be cheap they do not have experience or qualification and they provide another way of avoid the restriction and rule that be rightly put on the management of property they do not bother with proper service charge information or proper list of charge for permission fee accept that the government have try to improve that but in the end such improvement will only work if the individual or organisation manage the property do so in proper way will the minister look at those issue what be the rationale why be there resistance to ensure that people do serious and important job as property manager be qualified to do it and properly hold to account through regulation let begin by declare my interest as an adviser to the hspg group which among other thing be registered provider of social housing rise to speak to new clause which be base on specific challenge that have encounter in my constituency and that affect resident in more than home spread across three location in the town of hayle and the village of mount hawke the experience of those case expose potential gap in the bill and in policy on the issue of shared ownership the bill deal at some length with standard leasehold agreement and the problem of extortionate ground rent as well as with some of the issue around service charge and management company with which we be familiar however in the early some agreement be put together that be technically leasehold agreement but that masquerade as share ownership agreement even though those share ownership agreement do not comply with the standard of modern share ownership agreement the agreement have encounter contain number of defect and would like the minister view on they the first be that the freehold on those home be not hold by registered provider it be initially own by the developer who build the site but it have change hand twice in way that be familiar to many member the freehold have end up in the hand of an offshore investment vehicle base in the british virgin islands and with company call rockwell which have not be easy for resident to deal with over the year the second major defect in the agreement be that there be no provision for staircase or enfranchisement of the leaseholder share of the property resident typically own between and of their property but their stake be fix and can not be extend there be no right to extend under the agreement the agreement be under year lease and there be no ability to extend that although appreciate it be long term lease the third defect be that even if resident could enfranchise and extend or staircase their ownership within the agreement section covenant mean that the property must be sell to local connection with significant discount on market value the way that have be word in the agreement mean that it be simply not worth the while of resident to increase their share since there would be no value to the increase share that they would have finally there be something describe as ground rent although in practice big chunk of that be effectively rent on the share ownership portion the ground rent be initially around per week but that be link to the retail price index on an escalating model it have now get close to per year for those resident and it be still increase rapidly all of those defect in that leasehold tenure arrangement or share ownership arrangement indeed it appear to be neither one nor the other mean that all of the property have be judge unmortgageable by lender and that mean the resident be trap they can not sell their property because no one can get mortgage to buy they these be people in my constituency who have local connection typically they be on modest income these agreement and these home be sell to they as way to get foot on the housing ladder and for those resident it have transpire to be complete nightmare will say word about planning and pay tribute to penwith district council as it be then and cornwall council planning be grant between and and the local planning authority do their due diligence they could see that this share ownership model be defective and they refuse planning permission on all three site on that basis the minister might ask how these home be then build and sell under the arrangement but suspect he can predict the answer which be that they be approve at appeal by the planning inspectorate an agency within his own department the situation that my constituent face have be cause principally by chronic failure of due diligence by the planning inspectorate as be often the case with such issue in conclusion my new clause seek to address gap in the bill and to give the government the opportunity to atone for the mistake of the planning inspectorate it deal explicitly with shared ownership agreement and would create statutory right to staircase ownership and put cap on the rent of the freeholder portion of the home do not intend to press new clause to division this evening but hope that the government will consider the matter closely would like to meet the minister or the secretary of state and share with they and their official copy of the shared ownership agreement that my constituent be suffer under so much with view to see whether the government might consider further change at late stage of the bill consideration to address gap in it give that the planning inspectorate have be somewhat culpable in create this problem for my constituent hope that the government will seek to do that support the general thrust of the bill in all its attempt to deal with management charge service charge and ground rent but hope that the minister will agree to meet to discuss some of these remain issue it be december have be an mp for one year and seven month to the day and be chain to the railing of college green by cheer leaseholder thankfully they be friendly it be to illustrate that leaseholder feel that they be be prison those be the day before social medium and it be photo op the bbc run the headline leaseholder demand more control they still do since then we have have the commonhold and leasehold reform act which be an attempt to resolve some of the problem such as forfeiture of person home for failure to pay small service charge the ground rent grazer charge money for no service and money not be hold in trust in sink fund it be strange that after year these should be the very area that yet another bill on leasehold reform be pretend and fail to solve say fail because that be the reason rise to support new clause table by my hon friend the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook it be ridiculous that landlord can take away person home worth hundred of thousand of pound for simple failure to pay minor service charge amounting to couple of hundred pound and where there be dispute over whether the service be even provide that be why table new clause about money be hold in trust which would implement provision of the act that have never be bring into force we hear in committee that the policy have strong support from stakeholder include spokespeople for the property institute and the leasehold advisory service even the british property federation have campaign for this provision of the act to come into force yet it be not here in the bill of course be time when nobody have even predict the new renti practice that freeholder and developer have since invent to extract money from homeowner for the privilege of live in their own home the scandal of leasehold house the repeat doubling of ground rent and the inclusion of commercial area and share service in any development to stop any hope of resident exercise their right to manage new clause would ensure that leaseholder in mixed use building could take advantage of the government policy to lift the non residential premise cap to and to have mandatory leaseback on expensive commercial premise unless that new clause or version of it be adopt few leaseholder in mixed use building will be able collectively to enfranchise under the bill which would be travesty if the government do not decisively address the structural dependency rule not only for enfranchisement but for right to manage property developer will simply sidestep the new non residential premise limit by design mix use block with share service connect flat to commercial premise by an umbilical cord to deny leaseholder their right indeed article from lead law firm explain how developer can build site to ensure that block can never be eligible for collective enfranchisement and right to manage new clause would provide the appropriate tribunal with the discretion to dispense with certain procedural requirement where it be satisfied that be reasonable to do it be design to deal with case where landlord attempt to frustrate right to manage claim by procedural mean be grateful to mark loveday of tanfield chambers perhaps the lead authority on service charge and right to manage practice in britain for his help in draft the new clause by mr loveday count of the law commission recommendation on right to manage few than five have be specifically adopt by the government in the bill whole industry have emerge since labour introduce the act which bring right to manage into existence whereby freeholder seek to find minor technical error by leaseholder to scupper genuine and otherwise valid right to manage claim since right to manage be no fault regime parliament never intend for it to be an invitation to litigation by deep pocket freeholder and their army of lawyer as mr loveday note the act right to manage do have trap for the unwary and the single most important problem with the right to manage namely its procedural complexity with these problem famous among property lawyer have notoriously lead to litigation on truly industrial scale urge the minister to look again at new clause in the other place and adopt such pragmatic amendment which would enable tribunal to waive minor procedural mistake by leaseholder where it deem that just and convenient since we have also have the grenfell tower tragedy which have expose the rotten culture of residential construction in this country member should wonder why it be that over tower block be reckon to have fire safety defect no fire stop in build voids lack of compartmentation combustible cladding and inadequate fire door that leave the resident at the mercy of landlord who literally go to the other side of the world to avoid have to pay for remediation resident be subject to unfair service charge and find themselves prisoner trap in their own home unable to sell up and move on with their life this unjust system leech off ordinary people and sham we this be the only remain country in the world where residential leasehold be the default tenure for apartment living person home should not be source of misery to they and one of unjust enrichment to other we be talk about the life of million people who need to be free from their feudal burden that bring to new clause which seek to restore the intent of the section major work regime in the act to what it be prior to the daejan ruling the minister be good enough in committee to confess that he be unaware of the ruling and say that he would study it with his official yesterday receive letter from he on some of the point raise in committee he admit that since daejan the vast majority of application for dispensation be bring by the landlord however he go on to say regardless of which party make the application the landlord will have to persuade the tribunal that dispensation should be grant and it will be for the leaseholder to evidence that they have suffer prejudice he say recognise your concern that leaseholder have to evidence prejudice but only they be able to do so once that threshold have be meet the burden be on the landlord to rebut the impact the prejudice have have on the leaseholder he conclude the consequence be that an application to the tribunal be not merely rubber stamp the landlord request fundamentally disagree sue bright professor of land law at oxford university have be conduct research into this area and argue as follow the importance attach to the consultation requirement be evidence by the fact that if the landlord fail to conduct the statutory consultation it be prevent in the current form of the consultation provision from recover more than from an individual tenant in relation to those work seemingly this provide very strong incentive to comply with the requirement but the protection offer be seriously weaken by the supreme court decision in daejan investment properties ltd benson lord neuberger say that the consultation requirement be means to an end rather than an end in themselves he see the provision as play support role in achieve only the end goal of consumer protection secure by section of the landlord and tenant act that is protect tenant from unreasonable service charge an alternative vision support by the dissent judgment of lord wilson acknowledge that consultation be an important end in itself this recognise that consultation have an inherent value far it be in keep both with the tenor of the new building safety regime that promote full engagement with leaseholder and resident and the thrust of contemporary government policy towards provide consumer protection to leaseholder her finding be grim for supporter of leaseholder and sense of fair play she say in all of the fire safety case review for this article dispensation be grant at least in part and with few exception the overwhelming majority be grant unconditionally even when the ftt the first tier tribunal be critical of the way in which the applicant have manage thing also thank dr haward soper another academic who help draft the amendment who be appal by the number of successful dispensation win by freeholder that he find in his study of first tier tribunal decision urge the minister to think again because this cut to one of the most fundamental injustice that we have see in leasehold apartment in recent year those individual trap in building with fire safety defect this bill be the first set of reform to the leasehold tenure in year the test that set the then labour administration be simple one say what we want be for leaseholder to be able to take control over their own life without landlord be able to say when you have new roof how much you pay for it who do it when it go to happen you should be able to decide that for yourself in your own home the proposal in front of we today do not liberate leaseholder the secretary of state himself have say do believe leasehold be fair in any way it be an outdated feudal system that need to go and we need to move to well system and to liberate people from it he be right this bill do not do that it will be leave to future labour government there be lot of good thing in this bill give credit to the minister and previous ministers for introduce it and my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller who have play massive role in bring it to the house it effectively ban the sale of new leasehold house through new clause that we have be discuss extend leaseholder right in various way and increase transparency over service charge however there be two big thing that still need to be strengthen in the bill which we have speak about in committee and on report the first be to end the fleecehold estate model new clause and be relevant to that be glad to hear the minister who understand this issue talk about go away and consider this far but for the benefit of the whip what my constituent want be not for the minister to consider it far but to ride in like new sheriff on white horse and sort out the fraudster scam artist and various cheat who be make their life misery that be what we want on the government benches the fleecehold estate scandal be just like the post office scandal except that it affect more people in consider the post office scandal many people have ask how could we not have know about this injustice it ruin so many people live for so long yet nothing be do it be the same in this situation my constituency have lot of these new estate often the first people know of the problem be when they receive massive bill that they do not know be come and that be not mention in the note they be give when they buy the house and funnily enough it be not draw to their attention by the lawyer of the housebuilder whose service they be often encourage to use some of these bill be really scary size and often escalate quickly over time huge number of people more and more every day be now affect about estate be affect involve between million and million homeowner and potentially million or million people accord to the competition and markets authority over the past five year of the freehold property build by the big builder have use this fleecehold model lot of my resident describe it as be like pay second council tax except that if local councillor be not do good job they can be kick out but it be not possible to do that to fleecehold landlord no matter how badly they perform new clause would address that and hope that the government will address it as the bill progress think that everyone now know how the fleecehold scam work back in the good old day the builder would build new estate make sure that all the road and so on be up to spec and pay section charge the council would then take it over and run it and if there be problem people could contact their local councillor under the fleecehold model it be not so simple in effect there be collusion between the council and the developer the developer agree to hand over to different company it might own that company itself or hand it over to the resident the running of many part of the estate be it the road the verge or other facility that mean that the developer pay less in section the council do not have to maintain the road and effectively they split the profit while the resident and the new tenant get the new massive bill it be extremely inefficient to run thing in that way in the real economy usually the council go from road to road with its verge cut lawnmower it use one simple system on one fleecehold estate however guy drive down from oldham which be more than two hour away mow tiny bit of lawn and then leave it be economic madness lot of the charge that people be hit with involve opaque management fee for nothing it be inefficient to run thing in this way in the real world there be tick time bomb here in addition to the number of people affect by the fleecehold estate scandal the second problem be that when thing be not adopt they do not go through gateway where we can check whether they be up to scratch know from the experience of my constituency that lot of thing be do badly and then huge bill will land on the people on these poor estate to sort out the problem in the future we hear all about this in committee pay particular tribute to harry scoffin the work of the group free leaseholders and the resident group hornet the home owners rights network they all make powerful case to abolish the fleecehold estate model entirely as one witness tell the committee this be my property it be my hard earn future normal homebuyer be not qualified to manage estate if we be give the right to manage if we be look at development of over home it be really hard to get in touch with people who will agree and be on the same page it be not workable official report leasehold and freehold reform public bill committee january will give few example from my constituency karen be brilliant lady who do lot of work for her community she move into new barratt home because she be bored of do load of diy every weekend on her old home she now find herself spend massive amount of time fight fleecehold company call firstport company so notorious that national action group have be set up against it the detail can be find on facebook whose work commend karen explain barratt encourage we to use their nominate conveyance solicitor for which in return we get towards our legal bill we be fool to do this but money be tight firstport do do or arrange any grass cutting or anything by way of service in the first two year at first the bill be and this year it will be karen continue our bill for the year include property damage public liability insurance terrorism insurance grounds maintenance general maintenance firstport management fees the most expensive item audit external accountant certificate and fee general reserve health and safety risk assessment this come to per house she say in the month of december january and february each year must spend more than couple of day week work on this it like have part time job do move house to face the possibility of have to be director of resident right to manage company want adoption by the local council as it use to be she be right member may be ask why be resident of this estate have to pay terrorism insurance for fence that be very good question to which do not know the answer let introduce member to james brilliant hard work constituent of mine who have have to do ton of work on the estate where he live he say councils should be adopt new estate he say that he have do about day work over the first couple of year we move in in and it be really sort until in fact it be still go on have not be proactive we would have end up be short changed resident of hursley park in my constituency have have no end of problem with their developer who be currently refuse even to meet they to discuss some of their problem path have be do on the cheap and have become quagmire and bench have not be look after properly fortunately owe to legal error on the developer part the resident have manage to gain control of the resident management committee but after three year of effort they be still try to get the developer to make good the problem so that they do not face year of bill they be still fight many of they do not want to run their own estate and they should not have have to do so my last example relate to farndon fields an estate that have be build over the last decade by multiplicity of developer include redrow and avant courtyard and share space in the development be not adopt by the council astonishingly each tiny courtyard be run as its own financial entity and be subsequently manage by company call chamonix which turn out to be extraordinarily difficult to contact each year the resident be force to pay maintenance charge for couple of minute work over whole year one of my constituent write to on one occasion be continually ask to pay an invoice which have previously pay and despite send proof of payment two or three time be tell court action would be take reply welcome this and advise they that would counterclaim for stress and my time then receive an apology letter from the financial director be now fight charge for work for thankfully resident manage to wrest back control from the company after huge amount of effort that be just as well because chamonix have now be buy out by firstport so they have have lucky bullet could go on and on from charge resident for terrorism insurance for fence to rip out newly plant tree to charge resident for work that never happen the absurdity of the fleecehold scam be apparent to everyone who have encounter it however there be number of way in which we could solve the problem and while we need to solve it for exist resident which will involve some sort of right to manage and much clear ability to gain control of one own estate we also need to prevent this model from be use in the future we could take up the brilliant proposal of my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire to prevent management company from take on service that be normally provide by local council we could also take up the suggestion make by councillor shaun gunner the leader of the conservative group on arun district council to change the government guidance on the use of planning condition which currently state condition can not require that land be formally give up or cede to other party we could perhaps change the exist guidance to make it difficult for people to go down the fleecehold route whatever we do however we have to end this scammy model which be bring misery to the life of my constituent another thing that we must do be end forfeiture as be suggest in new clause and as the minister have suggest today be pleased that he be talk about take action margaret thatcher tell the conservative party conference in there be no prouder word in our history than freeholder she be right and the ideal of property ownership have long history on this side of the house but great many people who be buy freehold property be actually be con it turn out that they do not really own their property at all and that if they fall even little behind on their bill or refuse to pay some scammy fleecehold company small amount of money they risk not just be make to repay and perhaps pay the cost as well but lose their house it be that threat that enable the fleecehold cowboy to get away with it they be terrorise people by threaten they with the loss of their home and we must put stop to it as mrs thatcher say in her final book everyone involve in the country economic life have to be protect against extortion and corruption that be exactly what fleecehold be and we have to end it the final small thing that we must do in the bill be to start the use that word advisedly from ground rent ground rent be not payment make in return for any service the historical rationale for their existence be totally obsolete survey find that half the people who face these escalate bill do not realise that they would be apply when they buy their property and they cause huge problem with remortgage understand the problem and challenge of have to move away gradually from this model but we should start to turn the supertanker now we be talk about pure economic rent and pure rentier it be totally unfair system we might have to move slowly but we have to start the movement away from these ground rent grazer because this be an unfair system with no rationale know that the minister understand the issue and encourage he on all these issue to be brave and sort out the problem there have be no legislation since this be our one chance so let really go for it let we have conservative principle and end these massive rip off rise to speak to new clause and amendment to huge number of new build have be build within my constituency boundary over the last month the vast majority of which have be flat there have be numerous difficulty over the year many of which will not be able to cover today due to the time limit and your exhortation mr deputy speaker to stay within seven to eight minute as the first woman to speak intend to do so will start with legacy wharf in stratford where leaseholder have be stick with succession of management company that fail they time after time under the former management company shoddy and probably overprice repair be make by favour company at leaseholder expense over and over again rather than any investment in long term high quality maintenance resident be hugely suspicious about possible kickback from service firm to the management company and the use of company under the management company ownership rather than it seek the good price and the good quality of service thankfully that management company have change but many problem remain resident have just be hand bill for month of energy use all at once due to the management company mistake service charge and insurance bill rocket year after year with resident wonder what on earth have be do with their money they have poor landscaping broken lift and inadequate fire door the security of communal area be rubbish resident have lose access to hot water and the boiler have not be service for as long as four year those be all serious concern raise about just one building ultimately when accountability be seek there be absolutely no way to get prompt response when there be such as constant deficit of transparency it inevitably look like way to cover up wrongdoing mismanagement or incompetence strongly welcome the provision in this bill on service charge transparency and add my support for the amendment table in the name of my hon friend the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook amendment and would surely provide additional support to my constituent because they would mean that leaseholder would not have to pay service charge unless basic transparency and accountability be in place amendment would enable maximum cost to be set for the provision of information to leaseholder prevent the abuse of such cost to effectively obstruct accountability it ai on leaseholder in every part of west ham have face massive difficulty get accountability be remind of event in the hallsville quarter development in canning town where resident in several building have to leave their home after sewage ingress and power cut the two management company respond in totally different way grainger offer day in subsistence payment while firstport initially offer just day and only raise it to after enormous pressure firstport have to be chase by for multiple basic action and respond so poorly to resident whose life have be turn upside down by problem that be absolutely not of their making next would like to raise the continue concern of the resident of chobham manor about their estate charge which have increase rapidly over recent year the charge be suppose to help pay for the upkeep of the queen elizabeth olympic park but many chobham resident believe that it bear no relation at all to the amenity available to resident near the park despite my support they have find it almost impossible to scrutinise the budget they be pay for and to make sure that they ai pay through the nose for poor value for money chobham manor resident frankly do not see what they be get from the park in exchange for this charge give that they be the only local resident who pay for it know that they will be grateful for an explanation of how they might benefit from the change that the bill will make also want to mention yet again the continue limbo of many resident of east village in stratford leaseholder there have live under serious financial threat for well over four year now the remediation need to make their home safe be still be hold up because this government previous legislation leave the issue open to litigation how can my constituent be reassure that this bill go far the secretary of state himself commit to use his planning power to call in proposal submit by irresponsible developer have to ask will he make good on that promise and target those who be continually refuse to act on fire safety and leave leaseholder on the hook in final case from west ham diligent and determined leaseholder have successfully take manage agent or freeholder to the tribunal for their dire failing be sorry to tell the house that these failing be across the board include rat infestation lack of insulation cause skyrocket energy bill no transparency on the huge service charge build safety problem and complete lack of accountability surely it should not have come to this we should not be depend on individual leaseholder to battle their way through obscure system for their plight to get the attention it need mp should not have to make dozen of detailed representation over and over again it could not be clear who have the power in these dispute and in so many case leaseholder be still pay the price for system that be absolutely broken sadly the legacy of year of failure to act create understandable scepticism that change will come now so want to hear from the minister today that he believe that the bill will finally end this injustice it be pleasure to follow the hon member for west ham ms brown we share similar part of the world essex and the east of london in romford just as in west ham and the london borough to the east of the capital we have see huge increase in the number of flat and high rise block be build over the last year havering be town and country borough and we have not have many flat in the past but suddenly we be see huge number of that kind of accommodation be build this bring huge number of problem with it include what we be debate today thank the minister for bring this bill forward hope that it will deal with many of the issue that colleague across the house have raise today because they be very real sense that there be consensus on both side of the house that serious action need to be take because this can really destroy people life and ruin they they have save to buy property and they have leasehold yet they be fleece by shark and manage agent who pile on the cost and by army of lawyer who make their life miserable and threaten they with lose their property all together this be not right for the people we all represent be now deal with these case in romford on daily basis the hon lady mention many of the problem in west ham and have example in the steelway apartment in the centre of romford visit those apartment only few week ago and see the problem that people there be face they be fail to get response from the management agent and those responsible they be pay money for no service and they be be rip off by management agent who be not do the job they be pay to do go to rubicon court fairly new development build only few year ago and be shock absolutely flabbergast to see how badly the resident be be look after the service they be pay for have completely fail see mould rat rubbish and cctv camera that do not work that be not acceptable and when the bill be pass into law hope the minister will ensure that it be effective it be no good pass legislation unless it be effective and come into force quickly have concern about the speed with which this legislation will be enact people be suffer and live in terrible condition and they be spend huge sum from their saving to deal with these problem will the minister assure the house that there will be an effective way to implement the bill quickly will he also consider the point that many member have raise about those who could lose their property what horrific prospect it be for people who have save to buy their leasehold that because of the issue we have discuss they be bully and threaten with lose the property they have work so hard to purchase there be so many issue and hope the minister will take on board everything that have be say today this be cross party issue and we want the good for our constituent who live in these property and whose life be make very difficult by the current system hope this bill will improve the life of all our constituent and the minister will have my full support in anything far he can do to ensure that people in romford and in every constituency represent here today be able to live well life people should not wake up with the feeling that everything they have save for their future be be lose because of deficient legislation and failure to enforce the law have spend lot of time visit romford resident in recent month and visit many of these place intend to go back because if there be one thing have learn about be member of parliament it be that we be here to serve the people we represent be very proud to serve the good people of romford can see that across the chamber there be strong concern for leaseholder who be catch up in very difficult situation will first speak to new clause which table after case come to my attention late last year will then speak in support of new clause and amendment and table by the official opposition these amendment relate to issue that have not be properly address by the government include forfeiture the right to vary ground rent to peppercorn and deferment rate my motivation for table new clause stem from what have happen to resident of lee court purpose build art deco mansion block in my constituency date back to the early many will remember the cold snap at the start of the year when temperature go below zero and arctic wind sweep across the country until mid january resident of lee court have not have any heating all winter furthermore they do not have access to hot water for week and prior to that hot water provision be very patchy this have seriously impact many vulnerable resident include the elderly young family people with medical condition and many other leaseholder at lee court repeatedly raise these issue with drivers norris the block former manage agent and grandpex the building freeholder that have ultimate responsibility for the central heating system yet little progress be make until it come to my attention and the attention of the national medium the resident plight include neglect communal area door lead to the roof that be hang off its hinge broken window expose opening for rodent weed and plant grow through the drain roof leak damp mould and rot in communal area and the lack of heating and hot water that have already mention even though my constituent have now take on the building maintenance and appoint new manage agent this situation illustrate the difficulty for leaseholder in secure recourse from freeholder who have responsibility for central heating and other maintenance issue as result my new clause seek to open up discussion on how to ensure that such situation never happen again to resident it would require the secretary of state to commission an independent evaluation on hold freeholder financially liable for long last central communal heating failure where the freeholder have responsibility for this upkeep it be important for the government to know that be not ask for they to impose measure straightaway but rather that want they to pay close attention to the problem at hand via an independent evaluation there be clearly something wrong when vulnerable resident be leave without heat for month on end despite raise their concern with the manage agent the only way they seem to be hear be by go to the medium and that be not acceptable resident health and wellbeing need be put at risk by the failure to restore lee court central heating the government have duty to look at how we can rectify this situation so that it never happen again will the minister say whether he would like to strengthen the voice of leaseholder leaseholder would like that they need it more widely this overdue bill be welcome but the government plan reform do not go far enough this be why particularly support new clause which would abolish the right of forfeiture in respect of residential long lease where the leaseholder be in breach of covenant have hear the minister say that the government be work on this and will be look at the issue but the law commission propose repeal in and there have be no action to progress this for some year additionally amendment and on deferment rate be very important because during housing and cost of living crisis with many family struggle to get by it be important for leaseholder to acquire their freehold or extend their lease at the low possible cost lastly amendment be important because we must ensure that all leaseholder not just those with residential lease of year or over have the right to vary their lease to replace their rent with peppercorn rent that be because the most common form of lease be those of and year and so the bill as it stand will mean that leaseholder with the most common form of lease will not be able to enjoy the right to vary their ground rent to peppercorn in conclusion in contrast to the government approach labour government will enact the law commission recommendation in full labour will make commonhold the default tenure for all new property in order to reform the leasehold system fundamentally and comprehensively in my constituency what have happen to the resident of lee court show that the current leasehold system be not work suggest that the government accept my new clause as well as the labour amendment rise to speak to new clause and which stand in my name wish to place on record my thank to those right hon and hon member who support with my amendment and to the public bill office for assist with advice on their drafting today bill be important and think we would all agree that it be long await speak on second reading when declare that like probably many other here be one of almost million leaseholder in this country be also one of the many who have go through that awfully stressful process of extend lease that be prior to my be an mp what have learn since become an mp be that the issue of leasehold affect not just london and our great city but constituent in place such as aldridge brownhills it affect people who have buy house on leasehold basis and many apartment block that be build perhaps or year ago that be why have take such keen interest in this piece of legislation buy home be the big financial commitment that most people will make in their lifetime but they be probably unaware of some of the complication they may experience later down the line raise many question on second reading and write to the secretary of state my hon friend the minister have be very engaged with but gently say to the department that bit more engagement with back bench members would help enormously that say be clear that want the bill to succeed although in common with many other hon member still believe it could and should go far will not push my amendment to vote today but want to make few point in relation to they on new clause the prohibition on new leasehold home within three month of the passage of the act appreciate and welcome what the minister say from the dispatch box the government have long be commit to the provision in that new clause and have seek clarity about what exactly they intend to do have hear welcome news today but will continue to press the point about commonhold because that matter move forward if we be to continue to look at this legislation and get it through this place we will have to revisit this topic to ensure we get the good for our constituent whatever type of housing or home they live in new clause seek report on disadvantage suffer by exist leaseholder in effect it be the sunset clause refer to on second reading the extent of the number of leaseholder who start the process of extend their lease during the passage of the bill and the impact on they be unclear many will have be wait to see the outcome of this legislation quite feasibly that group will include people who have be force to extend their lease in order to sell their home because as we know it be very difficult if not impossible to get mortgage on short lease be certain some leaseholder will not have be able to wait for the bill to reach royal assent such leaseholder risk be seriously disadvantage so new clause would take step to assess and remedy any unfairness by consider issue such as marriage value legal cost and other charge do not think we fully appreciate the size of this group compare to the number of people who will extend their leasehold after royal assent similarly new clause seek to redress the imbalance and unfairness of marriage value for those leaseholder who extend their lease many year ago or prior to the bill pass through this place by seek to produce report on disadvantage due to payment of marriage value hope we can well understand the extent of some of challenge around system that as we have hear today be feudal difficult to navigate and have disadvantage many leaseholder over the year it be important that we do not lose sight of the need to address the issue of marriage value the fourth area of concern be grind rent do not table an amendment on this issue but will touch on it again many colleague on both side of the house have mention it the minister be clear in his response to but we need to continue to push forward for change will support the bill and welcome the step that have be take however from the many example that colleague on both side of the chamber have highlight today and the example we have all see send to our inboxe by constituent particularly around the challenge of service charge it be clear that we need to go far will continue to gently nudge the minister he be nod his head he do really good job and be certain he get the issue but let we continue to work together for the benefit of our constituent have nine member try to catch my eye so if people speak for about five minute that will allow everyone to get in roughly equally there have be some slippage can see that rise to speak to new clause which be in my name it be also consider in committee be most grateful to my hon friend the member for brent north barry gardiner for move it there and to the minister for his response be also grateful to the hon member for loughborough jane hunt and the right hon member for west suffolk matt hancock who have add their name to the new clause on the order paper thank the minister for his reply in committee but think he miss the crucial central point of the amendment at the moment the risk of exposure to asbestos in workplace be manage by the control of asbestos regulations which be monitor by the health and safety executive for every workplace under those regulation there be duty holder responsible for monitor the condition of the asbestos they be require to keep up to date record of the location and condition of all asbestos contain material to provide that information to anybody liable to disturb the material and to develop plan for manage any risk that arise residential block with commercial freeholder will generally also have duty holder because the block will have be for they workplace so it be cover by the control of asbestos regulations it be usually the freeholder or their agent who be the duty holder that duty holder be responsible for all the common area in the block such as foyer and staircase the effectiveness of this whole regime be debatable the sixth report in the session of the work and pensions committee express considerable reservation it be doubtful think that the health and safety executive be do enough to monitor compliance and the assumption that leave asbestos in place be well than remove it be increasingly questionable as the asbestos age none the less there be at least clear regime for manage the risk the concern that motivate this new clause be that follow transfer of the kind make possible and facilitate by the bill there will no long be duty holder for the communal area in such block at the moment there be but the responsibility will be entirely extinguish as far as understand it on transfer the asbestos be still go to be there the risk will remain but nobody will any long be responsible for manage they understandably no individual resident will take on the responsibility but there will be no corporate entity to do it either in fact it may be bad than that the resident may well not be aware before the transfer be complete that they be take on both financial liability for manage the asbestos in the communal area and possibly risk to life as well it be important to bear it in mind that we be see death per year at the moment as result of past exposure to asbestos in his response in committee the minister say that the amendment would duplicate the exist duty in regulation of the control of asbestos regulations for landlord to survey the common area of their report leasehold and freehold reform bill public bill committee january however the newly enfranchise property would not fall any long under regulation there would be no landlord to survey the common area once the transfer have take place new clause aim to prevent this problem from occur it require landlord to perform detailed survey of the asbestos present in the building within three month of transfer take place and then require the landlord to remove any asbestos that be there there be tax relief for business remove asbestos from their premise so removal will not be costly for landlord it will save newly enfranchise leaseholder from large and probably unexpected liability and potentially lethal long term risk hope that make the case for this change clear be grateful to the minister for his assistance with the resident of barrier point in my constituency think we have meeting in his office next month last night have my regular zoom call with leaseholder from waterside park in my constituency before christmas we think we have clear way forward barratt the builder have sign up and aviva the current freeholder be happy but last night we learn of the requirement that the building safety regulator to look at any proposal for minimum of eight week which will substantially delay the work that have be commit to will the minister look at whether it be really necessary for resident who have be wait so long for these problem to be resolve to wait another eight week fully support the government wish to overhaul the antiquated and feudal leasehold system in this country and address the imbalance of power between freeholder and leaseholder thank the minister for his ongoing discussion with about number of issue have with the bill and for attend the leasehold roundtable that hold recently with my constituent would like the government to abolish the system completely but understand that that will not happen with this bill have therefore table an amendment and three new clause that would improve the bill far new clause would reduce the participation threshold require to claim the right to manage from to that be massive issue in cities of london and westminster more than property in the city of london and an eye water in westminster have owner live abroad or be own by company use central london golden postcode as place to park their cash that reduce the ability of leaseholder in those block to secure the of signature require to achieve the right to manage as it be incredibly difficult to contact those overseas leaseholder for meaningful discussion let give an example of that type of dilemma in my constituency resident in the quadrangle in the hyde park estate say that leaseholder in their block will struggle to meet the participation threshold they estimate that at least of leaseholder in their block do not live in the building and be uncontactable accept new clause and lower the threshold to would give many more leaseholder live in similar block the chance to manage their building commend the work that have be do on the bill to support block that have share commercial and residential usage the bill propose to increase the proportion of commercial or non residential space permit in an individual block for right to manage application from to but believe we can go even far have hear from many resident whose block will fail to qualify even after the threshold rise to for example resident of artillery row in victoria believe that increase the threshold to do not go far enough as the residential element of their block be low than that be why amendment be need as it would allow resident in block with up to commercial premise to apply for the right to manage new clause be similarly design to allow more leaseholder to strive for the right to manage especially those in mixed use building simply share broom cupboard with commercial property can disqualify they from claim the right to manage at cambridge court in marylebone for example leaseholder strive to manage their block would benefit from the government proposal to increase the non residential threshold allow in building but they be concerned that their ability to qualify for the right to manage would be undermine by the existence of single share car parking space in their building my new clause would amend the commonhold and leasehold reform act by adopt recommendation from the law commission right to manage report which be to allow leaseholder in mixed use building with share service or underground car park to exercise the right to manage finally my new clause would correct the unintended consequence of the building safety act that act have interfere with the long stand section regime which be vital right for leaseholder it introduce an accountable person mechanism that expressly ban section manager from be the accountable person consequently specially train and vet professional property manager willing to take on difficult site have be bar from be the accountable person that make absolutely no sense and it strip leaseholder of an exist right that could not have be the government intention when they introduce the act which be intend to provide leaseholder with additional statutory protection so many leaseholder in my constituency and across the country would benefit from apply for section manager but they can not risk it if they be in block of metre or high because of the accountable person regime issue arise from the building safety act it be imperative that our building be safe that leaseholder be safe and that the burden do not fall heavily on leaseholder will not press my amendment to vote but hope that the government will consider what have speak about and work with to introduce the measure in the other place this be watershed moment for the government to prove that they understand the terrible treatment that leaseholder have face and continue to face by incompetent freeholder and to address the imbalance between freeholder and leaseholder hope that the bill will deliver real change rise to speak to new clause which be table in my name and in support of number of new clause and amendment table by right hon and hon member from both side of the house table new clause because as be say by the hon member for harborough neil who be no long in his place fleecehold be scam it attempt to deal with the issue whereby freeholder be trap in situation where they pay estate management charge for the area around their development be they road play area or open space critically the new clause also deal with the share asset that might be in use to service their home such as ground source heat pump septic tank or sewage pump be sure that there be many instance in which the management company do great job and charge reasonable fee for its work but my inbox like those of many hon member contain horrify example of the management company which be usually directly own by or relate to the developer in north shropshire fail to do good job or to do any sort of job at all there be freeholder in my constituency for example who must obtain an information pack from their estate management company in order to sell their house despite repeat request my constituent have not receive that information pack so their sale have be significantly delay and be at risk of fall through altogether the management company be apparently just shell it do not respond to correspondence hold annual general meeting or provide account so the affected resident be powerless and can not take control of the company and appoint reliable professional to provide the service that they so desperately need new clause would allow they where the management company have go awol and will not respond to anything that they request of it to take control of the company and do those thing themselves the new clause also extend to asset which may be more of rural problem when it come to share estate charge in one example in my constituency developer instal ground source heat pump to provide all the heating and hot water for barn conversion development that involve several house in the same set of barn that developer have two separate company one be the management company through which he charge the owner of those house for their electricity bill and another totally separate company that be nothing to do with the sale process which be where he place the heat pump as such he be able to cream off all the renewable heat incentive income for himself he provide account to resident through the management company but do not provide they with any information about the fundamental asset that be service their home those resident be unable to benefit from the renewable heat incentive that accrue from that asset and do not know whether it be be properly maintain and service they be unable to do so themselves they have no right in relation to that heat pump that be quite complex situation in which suspect fraud may also be involve but there be other example where resident be unable to get their street light fix or their pothole sort out or where drainage be huge problem and they can not get any kind of response from the management company responsible new clause would allow resident to take over their estate management company in such instance which would hopefully provide management company with significant disincentive to fail to provide the service that they be presumably make quite lot of money out of crucially new clause would also enable those trap in exist arrangement to exit they as other member have mention once people with full time job have buy home they do not have time to endlessly chase up their management company and take they to court and tribunal over service that that company have fail to provide one of the resident have be deal with say to just do have the time to deal with this full time truck driver the idea behind new clause be to make it easy for those people to take control of those company and take control of their own life as have already be point out it be very worrying that these arrangement have be allow to proliferate across the country many resident be now pay both council tax and service charge for street lighting grass cutting and drain clearing that would normally be provide by local authority those people be literally pay more for the same service that be indefensible and million of people be trap in those arrangement amendment table by the hon member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller attempt to address that issue by prevent such charge from form part of the estate management charge that would certainly disincentivise developer from use that model but although it be beyond the scope of the bill urge the government to prevent those awful arrangement from happen in the first place it be much well for road to be adopt and maintain by the local authority so that everybody be pay for the same service on the same level playing field where people have share asset and be trap by an estate management company if their developer have fail to pay section fee they be also on the hook for that money have resident in my constituency who have charge of over their share area for section fee that be not pay and other resident pay million between people to bring sewage pump up to standard because it be an environmental health hazard if those problem have not be allow to occur in the first place if the local authority have have to require financial bond to be place so that if the development be not up to scratch when it be finish the local authority have the money to bring it up to scratch and adopt it those resident would not be in that awful situation really encourage the government to take that away and think about how we can protect people in the future draw to the hon lady attention and that of the minister the article by patrick hosking in the times today which deal with estate management company and estate management charge hope that the government will read what he have write and see what they can do to make thing well thank the hon gentleman very much for his intervention will conclude by say that support the amendment that would require professionalisation of the industry that would be very sensible and consistent with other legislation that the house have pass also support new clause and amendment and table by the shadow minister the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook new clause table by the chair of the select committee the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts and new clause table by the father of the house the hon member for worthe west sir peter bottomley the bill go some way towards provide the protection that we need but it need to go much far to protect freeholder from rogue developer and estate management company urge the government to take that away and do more to protect the last six speaker and protect ministerial time as well there be now five minute limit on speech which will give the front benchers sufficient time to respond it be great pleasure to serve on the public bill committee on this bill we have great debate and there be actually lot of agreement across the committee room these be deeply conservative reform champion by none other than mrs thatcher start in which she continue to do throughout opposition and during her premiership gently say to opposition members of whatever party that they must not fall into the trap of make this political football they must engage with the seriousness and complexity of these reform in part because as we have hear they do very little to advance these very significant reform during their own time in office suspect that they back away from it because of the very significant legal challenge they would have face as we ourselves will no doubt face pretend they do not exist be not serious position say to the minister and the secretary of state who be aware of my comment that we must not buckle but must continue to take this forward it be great to see the package of amendment lay by the government particularly new clause which be ban on leasehold house want the minister to think carefully about how he will address the inevitable imbalance in the creation of two tier system in which some people will have the freehold of their house but some will not there be an additional imbalance between flat in our urban area and new freehold house that point be very well make by james vitali in policy exchange report be slightly worried about the omission from this of retirement property so perhaps the minister could return to that in committee speak about the need to truly move towards commonhold system think the opposition new clause be something of that nature very much hope that as the bill go through complete its stage the government here or in the other place can look at that suggestion think we do need to set out the future legislative scaffold for our fifth term in office and to build on the work we have do so that we can finally get rid of this leasehold system other members have mention lot of the point would have make about share service my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken raise that and it be one of my concern my hon friend the member for harborough neil have do fantastic job in talk about the lack of adoption by local authority there be also new clause which know be again an opposition amendment and new clause and this problem be not go to go away it be blight on many homeowner in redditch and it also go to the heart of our planning system we really do need to look at that we can not pretend that it be go to solve itself thank the minister for write to about one of my concern which be litigation cost think new clause look at that he have reassure that what be in this bill will go the distance in ensure that leaseholder be not subject to unjust litigation cost by their landlord that be one of the case highlight by liam spender and many other these be hugely complex issue but we must tackle they want to see ground rent reduce to peppercorn it be pure extortion and feudal relic from medieval time when people be serf and work the land we should not have this in or in any year refuse to believe that there be not way through the wit of man and the considerable intelligence of ministers on the front bench to solve the issue perhaps where some financial asset be hold in pension fund do not buy the pretence of that incredible con artist mr steve whybrow and his outfit that somehow we be robbing pensioner would urge anybody with an interest in this debate to look at the genuine pensioner who be fight for the right to have pure enjoyment of their own property which they richly deserve after lifetime of working will make my final remark on forfeiture it must go the forfeiture of long lease can not be right it can not be right that freeholder can hold this nuclear bomb over somebody such as dennis jackson pensioner of plantation wharf he dispute service charge which lead to an legal bill and he have his flat forfeit during minute hearing at wandsworth court thank the knowledge leasehold partnership for all the work it have do to help he that just simply can not be right and we must address it want to see we finally finish the job that mrs thatcher start when she be opposition housing spokesman in we must finish that job and thank the minister for all the work he have do so far feel for the minister today because he must be kick himself this be probably one of the few debate have hear in this place recently where have not hear bad idea as constituency mp we see time and again the problem cause by retain this feudal system of leasehold and suspect that the minister who have be look at this issue for some time be kick himself because what he would really like to do be abolish the whole thing indeed today we have hear support from across the house to do just that in the short time available let say again to he that he would have our support to move to commonhold he talk about how commonhold be probably the well model and for those of we live in the vortex of gentrification where thousand of flat have be build in our community this be an incredibly pressing issue we know that the casework we have see over the past few year will expand as result of leasehold continue that be why wish to see the government change their mind perhaps in the other place about get rid of leasehold altogether and why have be press my local authority to listen to concern of local resident who be stick with leasehold and change our local plan to make commonhold the default hope that they have hear this debate and will rethink their opposition to that support the amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook and wish to draw the minister attention to two new clause that have table on issue with the exist system and the problem that leaseholder face with leaseholder in walthamstow know that these issue will come up time and again new clause be about the fact that although we have leasehold legislation it do not tally with our consumer legislation leaseholder pay service charge they have contract with freehold management company to oversee problem in their property but few resident feel empower to access right that exist under the consumer rights act to have reasonable service within reasonable timeframe for repair today colleague across the house have give countless example of that so let add my own which be where my propose new clause have come from be sorry that my hon friend the member for lewisham east janet daby be not here she talk about lee court and new clause but resident in essex brewery in walthamstow have be without hot water and heating since before christmas indeed they be still without hot water and heating with little sight of any change essex brewery be build just five year ago it have become apparent that the build by crest nicholson be poor at good and downright con at worst until january this year crest nicholson be on the management committee and make more than million in profit in the year that essex brewery be build it have make half that this year possibly less because of widespread concern about the condition of the build it have make what do someone do when they have buy possibly their first home whether through shared ownership or leasehold as hundred do in that development and they find that the pipe that bring in the hot water be faulty be sorry to say that those resident have little redress because the management company kinleigh folkard and hayward another multimillion pound organisation leave they without any explanation of why it would not repair the hot water until after christmas what christmas present that be the grinch have strong competition that be another layer of bureaucracy kfh be appoint by the essex brewery management company which be establish by the freeholder helpfavour to meet those obligation kfh tell the resident that because their insurance policy say that as long as they have water at all the property be habitable and it be not go to do anything about it that have leave hundred of resident many of they vulnerable for month on end without any hot water or heating in the current weather resident have have to boil kettle to get hot water to cleanse their baby or pay bill that they can not afford for extra heating through portable heater for those who have share ownership it be even more complicated metropolitan thames valley state that it own of those property and that it be prohibit by law from fix the problem new clause be about match consumer legislation with leasehold legislation and give resident the right of redress not say you ve either get to buy out the leaseholder if you want some property control or you be stick with they and wait to see hope kfh hear this debate and be ashamed of its behaviour amendment be about leasehold tribunal know the minister speak of precedent setting but resident across the country would tell he otherwise beg he to look at the warner property in walthamstow and at management which repeatedly rip off constituent across the country the hon member for harborough neil be not here but he ask why people have to pay terrorism insurance in walthamstow that be the warner estate company which say that because the plane bomber live in our constituency household have to buy terrorism insurance such case come up time and again with leasehold and they do not get fix in the tribunal amendment would give precedent for some of my chelmsford constituent these provision can not come soon enough one constituent tell how he buy his leasehold flat seven year ago but now he and his wife want to move to big home to start family and progress their life for the past three year they have be unable to sell their flat they have try list the property with many different estate agent and have many offer but no buyer can get mortgage on the property due to clause in the lease that mean the ground rent can be double every year accord to my constituent nobody in this block of flat have be able to sell property since they feel stuck another constituent in another block of flat say that her family of three and dog have be try to move out of their one bedroom flat for more than two year because the ground rent exceed the arbitrary threshold set for property outside of london buyer can not get mortgage because if leaseholder be to default on the ground rent the landlord would have the right to repossess the family have try deed of variation indemnity policy and multiple mortgage lender all to no avail mortgage company value the flat at literally zero for most people buy one own home be mean to give security and stability choice and freedom but for these leaseholder life be more like be lock in time warp they be trap in prison of their own property unable to move on therefore welcome the measure in the bill and the amendment that the government have table today have listen carefully to what my hon friend the member for walsall north eddie hughes and other have say about forfeiture and what the minister say about cap on ground rent the minister need to go far on this issue another group of leaseholder be struggle live in king tower storey building with small amount of combustible insulation on the spandrel panel on the outside of the building it might need remedial work to remove and replace it think it be shocking that seven year after grenfell tower huge company barratt and the property management company estates and management ltd have still not carry out this remediation work one of the leaseholder richard email today he say that back in the service charge be just year this year he think he will have to pay richard and other leaseholder be first tell of the potential issue in august he say that since then they have be unable to fulfil any form of normal life due to these additional fire safety issue and the cost he say genuinely feel ill to think of what our service charge demand be go to be in march this year as well as increase in insurance barratt and ltd be blame the increase on the cost need to register the building under the new regulation of the building safety act thank the minister for his letter to on this subject even though paragraph of schedule be mean to protect leaseholder from the cost of legal and other professional service it be clear that my constituent and many other feel that they be be gouge for excessive cost finally some freeholder also face issue there be some truly stunning residential development in chelmsford where the park and public area be beautifully maintain by estate management company but that be not universal note that firstport have be name by my neighbour my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel as company that be particularly difficult to deal with even for member of parliament and agree with she it be so hard for freeholder to hold management company to account and to ensure that maintenance be do well and that the cost charge be reasonable be therefore glad that this bill will also include measure to give freeholder access to support via redress scheme and to require estate management company to be transparent when more leaseholder become freeholder as truly hope they will thank to the change bring in by this bill we need to ensure that these terrible practice be not just pass on to freeholder but that freeholder also have these right and the ability for redress the amendment table by the government new clause to in particular will offer my constituent some hope and quick mean of redress on many of the point raise in the house discussion will press the minister on some concern raise by my leaseholder constituent and by all colleague on the whole issue of remediation of defect and transparency and accountability at one development in my constituency that open in now significant period of time ago the resident experience shocking case of misery and distress the problem include water ingress damp and mould with child get sick as result which be unforgiveable there be also damage sprinkler system defective and non compliant fire door which be unthinkable in this day and age inadequate insulation we have hear about water pipe and the lack of heating and cold water roofing issue damage gate and poor ground maintenance on top of that when someone raise complaint guess what happen nobody do anything about it however whenever constituent get letter it be about their service fee increase it happen all the time that be not acceptable the resident seek redress but it just do not happen not only be they frustrated but we see clear issue with buck pass that be shameful and must be address this property be permit development and we should pause for thought on that be pro such development we need more of they but we must ensure that charlatan do not come along and exploit people who be desperate to buy their first home with all sort of thing happen in the building have have report from resident who have purchase their property more recently and guess what they be not inform of all the defect and the problem go on that be simply scandalous want to mention again firstport this should be topic of wide debate in the house and management company be meet firstport at the weekend again why do these company feel that they can be let off the hook they will not engage effectively in one case leaseholder of site in stanway be not notify of change in management company for about half year every single colleague in the house will have case of that nature firstport have refuse request to hold annual general meeting and have be lack in visibility if may will praise councillor kevin bentley my county council leader who be divisional member for the area in question and have secure public meeting for the weekend it will be the first point when we have be able to get in the room with these people to seek redress contractor come in and people be charge for monitor work that never take place it go on and on be grateful to the minister for how he open the debate and speak frankly about the issue and concern have suggestion to put to he yesterday it be announce that the competition and markets authority will look into the practice of house builder and whether there have be collusion in pricing and the development of scheme may suggest that it might be worth look into management company many of those house builder come part and parcel with the management company the house builder do the negotiation with the management company and there be lack of transparency should we be look at more open book contract around management company with detail of how they be bring on board by the developer publish so that there be great transparency for the purchaser that be really important as the minister department have already enlist the cma he may wish to ask it to look at that important area as well hope that he can respond to some of those point when he sum up all hon member be grateful for the chance to raise these point which speak to the totality of what we be see sense of lack of fairness for many of our constituent which the government be clearly press in the right direction and seek redress very much welcome the bill which address the frustration express by great many leaseholder in my constituency thank suzy killip from the pembroke park residents association and jo tapper at the sigers both of whom have face significant challenge while represent their community and take forward issue arise from the management and lack of service often provide to they under their lease arrangement would particularly like to thank ministers because this legislation take into account the way that the market have change many year ago start my career as financial adviser deal with people take out mortgage one stark change be the extent to which leasehold be see as an opportunity to extract money from people as investment to be trade by freeholder on the basis of extract the maximum possible amount rather than ensure good quality of service be involve in case as local authority councillor where part of the planning agreement be that road park and open space would be bring up to an appropriate standard to be adopt by the local authority once the development be complete an opportunity be spot by the developer and therefore people who have move in on the understanding that the local authority would take over because the road be build to adoptable standard for example find that it do not happen because it be see as an investment opportunity that be very much in line with the rip off refer to by member across the house commend ministers on take balanced approach on the need to recognise link between the arrangement in the bill and our housing supply the uk have the old housing stock in europe the ability of freeholder of large development to regenerate site where property that have be rent be fall vacant over period of time could be inhibit if there be proliferation of small freehold on those type of site if we be to ensure that the quality of our housing in particular energy efficiency be bring up to good standard it must still be possible for large site to be regenerate we must not inhibit that completely while address different concern about the right and freedom of leaseholder mention some constituent early the situation in particular at pembroke park be good example of why the reform in this legislation be so important the development be construct on former military site by taylor wimpey and hand over to be manage by housing association with mix of social housing tenant and private leaseholder there be umpteen issue still more than decade after the completion of that site and issue simply get to respond to problem include insulation that be never instal in building to the building regulation standard complete failure to ensure that proper ventilation be instal in the building and drain that be completely inadequate there have be progress but would add to the list of company raise by other member commend relatively new chief executive ian wardle on the progress that he be make but it remain huge challenge to my constituent and huge frustration that as opaque charge rise and rise the action of that organisation make it incredibly difficult even to understand whether the basic legal protection that they enjoy under exist legislation be be observe include how insurance cost be apportion across very large property portfolio strongly support the point make around forfeiture provision number of constituent have come to with significant challenge and justifiable concern about the rise service charge on their property it be completely unacceptable that they would forfeit significant amount of value that they have pay for and earn potentially to fall to the developer that be another opportunity for the shamelessly greedy to rip off our constituent be very glad that this legislation and the comment make by member across the house today will represent significant step towards end that practice thousand of homeowner in my constituency and million across the country who face estate management charge will have their right substantially increase thank to the provision in this bill be extremely grateful to the prime minister the secretary of state the minister and his predecessor my hon friend the member for redditch rachel maclean for include estate management charge in this bill that be extraordinarily timely give the finding release this week by the competition and markets authority in its final report it state as result of the emergence of the private management model and the market power confer on some management company household be face financial and emotional detriment and if the status quo be maintain this be likely to worsen over time it propose that the government of the uk and the devolved authority look at two area of measure the first be to provide great protection to household live under private management arrangement that be what this bill seek to do know that the minister have some card up his sleeve on forfeiture right to manage and probably host of other thing and hope that he will shake some of they loose as the bill move up to the upper house secondly the competition and markets authority make two recommendation to prevent the proliferation of private management arrangement for new housing estate the first be to implement common adoptable standard for public amenity on new housing estate and the second be to implement mandatory adoption of public amenity on new housing estate that sound good but it also sound long time away we know that this issue be grow rapidly so my amendment seek to stop it in its track by say that homeowner may not have pass on to they charge for any service or provision that be usually the recourse of the local authority can not for the life of understand why the opposition be not support this amendment know that it be bit of club and not very nuanced but it get to the heart of the matter could the minister therefore reassure the opposition as well as and other back benchers that he will look at what the bill can do to make progress on some of the measure mention by the competition and markets authority know that he want to do that just hope that he can go as far as he can will now turn to the propose treatment of marriage value there be concern which have be stress number of time that the decision we be make through this bill be base on limited information on important economic effect one example be the ability give to the secretary of state to decide option for the future of ground rent that be raise in response to the recent consultation another be how the government might determine the appropriate rate for the deferment and capitalisation rate and there be range of unquantified effect in the bill impact assessment in committee try to learn bit more about whether marriage value be real thing it be real thing it be enshrine in legislation in and prior to that in the bill do not abolish marriage value it transfer it in fact it be not possible to abolish marriage value in math it be an optional value it have real value this be decision not to abolish something but to take it from one group of stakeholder and give it to another it be billion transfer of wealth from one group to another and under the provision of the bill it would be retrospective on contract already enter into that be perfectly legitimate public policy position if we wish to take it but say to the minister that as currently propose it be fraught with legal risk and legal jeopardy my amendment would provide safe passage for this bill on its way to become law it would ensure that any lease below year at the time the act be pass would continue to have marriage value but any lease that go below year after the act have pass would not ask the minister to consider that as the bill move to its next stage with the leave of the house let start by thank all member for their contribution to the debate the breadth of discussion across the house have show that while we can discuss precisely how far we should go there be general consensus that progress need to be make and think all member will accept that it have be and be be make in the bill my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley table new clause and he be right to say that it deal with an important issue as he say consultation be open and we will review the response very seriously urge anyone whose view be as strong as those express by my hon friend to contribute to the consultation so that we can consider the issue in the round the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts speak passionately about his new clause and and understand the point that he be make hope that some of the change introduce in the bill will make the acquisition of freehold much easy we have discuss regularly the need for disincentive for freeholder not to respond or to go slow which should mean that the right to first refusal fall away to the extent that it be no long necessary be sorry to hear about the problem experience by the constituent of my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice he be kind enough to mention they to early but would be happy to meet he as he request because recognise that the specific matter that he raise be important to his constituent and we need to look into it in more detail the hon member for brent north barry gardiner who serve on the bill committee make many useful point can not do justice to all of they but be happy to continue the discussion about daejan holdings and building safety to ensure that if there be an issue that the government have not work through fully we understand the detail well the hon member for west ham ms brown my hon friend the member for romford andrew rosindell my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford and my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds highlight the huge inequity that be affect individual in individual block in their constituency that inequity be exactly the reason why we must make progress and hope that the bill be good proposition for that to happen the hon member for lewisham east janet daby be kind enough to give more detail about the background to her new clause in separate discussion what have hear about from she and also from the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy who be not in the chamber but who have similar concern be absolutely unacceptable entirely appreciate the individual concern that be feel and be keen to continue our discussion so that we can learn from it for the broad good of the building safety sector in general my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton table an important new clause about leasehold house be glad she recognise that the government have now introduce measure to deal with the issue that she raise she also raise two important point about report and be keen to meet she so that we can discuss those further and in particular discuss the impact involve can tell the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms that we be look into the issue of the building safety regulator and will be happy to talk to he about that when we meet to discuss barrier point since his speech have check the position on asbestos we do not believe that that right be extinguish but if we be not correct would be keen to talk to he far to ensure that we understand exactly how that regime will work in practice and to try to assuage his concern my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken exhort we to move at this watershed moment be keen to talk to her far about the participation threshold she have make powerful case both to in the house today and more broadly about the importance of ensure that this be workable particularly in the circumstance that be face in the centre of london while entirely understand the point make by the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan about some of these change worry about her new clause and ask she not to push it to vote while her intention be clearly noble the new clause would put we into position in which asset be be expropriate for the purpose of something that could be as insufficient as notice of an annual general meeting hope that she will reflect on that during the time we have leave before the vote my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel make strong point about the need to consider estate management far and have give commitment to do so firstport be raise by number of member include my right hon friend it may interest the house to know that my hon friend the member for harborough neil will lead westminster hall debate on that tomorrow so same time same place same discussion but an opportunity to consider far the people and organisation that be not do the right thing in this regard my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller have be an absolutely doughty champion of progress on estate management and he be absolutely right to do that his speech demonstrate again the strength of feeling about this issue and as say at the dispatch box moment ago we be consider it far and recognise the importance of do that turn to the contribution from the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook who speak for the opposition he have table new clause on forfeiture hope that the government have indicate very clearly that we recognise the significant problem in this area and be work through the detail although understand what he be try to do with amendment and we think it be proportionate to retain the current position that we have set out from the front bench for the same reason as in committee my hon friend the members for redditch rachel maclean and for harborough make very clear case about the importance of those on the government benches lean into reform in the time have leave know that other party and other tradition represent in this house will make similar case it be shared endeavour in this area want again to make the conservative case for leasehold reform build on our proud heritage of reform it be conservative government who be bring forward the most transformational proposal for improve the life of million of leaseholder it be conservative government who be build the case for change to deal with the iniquity present on new estate and who be commit to set ordinary family free from unnecessary burden it be conservative government who have bring forward one of the most comprehensive change to property in generation why have we come forward with these proposal it be precisely because it be conservative thing to do we be cautious about interfere in the market for fear of unintended consequence or the creation of barrier we know that no government can ever fix every problem but when we be convince about the case for reform we will fight for it with every sinew at the heart of be conservative be the desire to smash monopoly and remove bad practice we will celebrate where thing work well but we will joyfully remove distortion that be exploit by chancer and rogue we will constrain rent seeker and middleman who add little to the basic economic exchange of good and service that be at the heart of our economy fundamentally we be committed to make our market more perfect and as consequence to set people free to make their own choice live their life and build their own future leasehold have be exploit for far too long by those who have no interest in the good functioning of capitalism the lack of transparency clarity and redress in freehold estate charge cause frustration up and down the land and it do nothing for the efficient functioning of market that be why we be reform adam smith talk of ground rent as monopolistic in hayek remind we in of the importance of make competition work and of not accept institution as they stand and as my hon friend the member for harborough indicate margaret thatcher assert in that there be no prouder word in our history as conservatives than freeholder that be the century long call as to why we have to make further improvement to our property system with this bill in the true spirit of thousand of conservative reform that have make this country well we be send clear signal that change for the well be come and will benefit million of people for the long term that be only possible because of all the hard work of all the official all the people in the law commission and my opposite number the hon member for greenwich and woolwich who have be extremely constructive on this bill give huge thank to professor nick hopkins tom nicholls and chris pulman at the law commission official in the department lead by robin froggatt smith my private office include grace doody and member from across the house for their valuable input although have just make the conservative case for reform we know that this be shared endeavour among we all which be why there be an unusual amount of unanimity in this place it demonstrate the importance of our continue to make progress on this issue as the bill move to the other place hope that those sit in the other place take note of the consensus and keenness here to ensure that progress be make hope they also take note of the importance of ensure that the bill continue and of the very many great reform

at unsafe speed even though it be surround by residential new build estate and very close to local school this be not an isolated incident there have be numerous accident on this specific stretch of road but despite the work of local resident who have set up road safety action group the danger remain should be grateful if the minister could provide some advice about what measure be at the community disposal and can be push so that action be take action that will certainly continue to fight for in this house want to make something very clear in north yorkshire too much of the debate on road safety have be wrongly co opt into wasteful irresponsible and distract culture war by the conservative party it hold majority on north yorkshire council and the executive position for highway and have of the county mp if the conservatives want to do something about road safety in my constituency and across the county they could do so instead they have spend recent month jump at shadow fight anti motorist policy that do not exist and oppose mph blanket ban that have never be propose all the while community in the selby district be cry out for political representative who will take the issue of road safety seriously what be too often forget be that when motorist step out of their car in village like cawood or town like sherburn in elmet they be local people who want to enjoy their community in safety and with their family rather than foment division that do not exist the government and north yorkshire council need to sit up get serious and listen to the concern of local resident in my area who can not wait another day for action to be take the minister could forgive resident across north yorkshire for their confusion over the mixed message they have receive from the conservative party which have mean that common sense way to limit dangerous driving have not be take in piece of literature send recently to local people in my area both the local conservative candidate and the party candidate for north yorkshire mayor register their opposition to welsh style blanket mph limit which to my knowledge not single representative of either main party in the county have propose in september however the very same mayoral candidate in his role as executive member for highway and transportation on north yorkshire council praise the most significant mph zone the council have ever introduce in harrogate agree and applaud those effort but ask why there can be grow up discussion about road safety in harrogate with seven school have new mph zone place around they but in the selby district we have to deal with unsafe road and suffer under conservative party that be distract by wag culture war that simply do not exist congratulate the hon gentleman on secure his first adjournment debate have to say that do not recognise his characterisation of the way the local council approach road safety issue he give the example of harrogate that particular campaign be start by two resident hazel peacock and jenny marks and it lead to broad community campaign the issue of mph zone around school be fairly uncontroversial particularly when they be adopt alongside such measure as crossing or barrier along the roadside have find that introduce simple measure like those have bring community together and it might be way to help the hon gentleman in selby and ainsty to an extent agree with the hon gentleman sentiment it be uncontroversial to have common sense measure such as mph limit in village outside school and in urban area wish the debate be tret with the seriousness it deserve in my part of north yorkshire by the council executive member for highway who have be able to achieve that work in harrogate by attempt to turn sensible measure such as mph zone where they be necessary into wedge issue in my part of north yorkshire the local conservative party disregard the concern of local resident meanwhile the council be not take action in village such as lumby monk fryston and hambleton where the immediate safety concern be acute and be badly damage community people want their council to get on with make their village and town safe in some case the excuse for inaction just do not add up return to the community of hambleton where local person tragically lose their life the which bisect the village be long straight stretch of road use by parent with pram elderly resident and large group of schoolchildren it be cry out for pedestrian island but north yorkshire council have argue that footfall on the road be insufficient use datum from study that be take during school holiday although be pleased that the council have commit to reassess the area due to the fatality that occur an accident should not have have to happen for people to realise that action need to be take in monk fryston over local resident petition for pedestrian crossing on the and they continue to have my full support north yorkshire council have acknowledge in my correspondence with it that speed be excessive on the road but it have refuse to implement the crossing because it say that there be not suitable location know that the installation of traffic calm measure be complicated business but this road be the key link between selby and leeds provide people with access to the again the bisect the village leave resident on the other side with no access to local amenity ask the minister to join in put the case to north yorkshire council that monk fryston can not be hold back and disregard any long in its campaign for common sense traffic calm measure now turn to the wide issue of speeding which know be of concern to all our constituent in brayton which lie just to the south of selby there have be consistent and widespread concern about speed along barff lane be glad that by work with local agency such as north yorkshire police resident concern have be hear and measure have be take to tackle the chronic problem of speeding on barff lane there be now speed activate warning sign along the road and north yorkshire police be in the process of identify suitable location for camera van site which will do much to ensure that driver along the road follow the speed limit and will ultimately save life in brayton regrettably speeding be also see in other place in my constituency include cawood an extremely rural village whose road be not fit for the amount of traffic that it see or for car go at the speed that they do recently hold drop in event for the community there and significant number of resident raise the issue of speeding and dangerous driving on sherburn street want to make it clear that the safety of resident in cawood should be top priority for both north yorkshire council and north yorkshire police although have be assure by the council that there be several exist traffic calm measure in sherburn street they be in reality have minimal impact on speeding in cawood would greatly appreciate any support the minister can give and local resident in work with north yorkshire council and the police to push for measure that will provide lasting solution to this issue it be clear that we have lot to do both in selby and ainsty and across north yorkshire to improve road safety every single injury and road death in our community be one too many and we must all work together to prevent this debate from be reduce to meaningless wasteful and distract culture war when our constituent be cry out for common sense change we need to ensure that local family and the community in which they live be protect across the length and breadth of our great county and look forward to work with anyone who be willing to make this reality congratulate the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather on secure his first adjournment debate think this be the first time have have the opportunity to answer question from he in the house of commons so congratulate he on win the by election my research tell that he be bear in which be very scary thought for those of we who well remember it be of particular concern to that when he first come to the house he indicate to that he use to work for my first parliamentary staffer pete mcmanus whom he describe as my boss it be worry when thing be so proximate that the age of individual member of parliament be catch up on you be sure that that be not an issue for anyone else in the house but it definitely be for take this debate very seriously and the hon gentleman rightly raise the concern of his constituent pass on my condolence on behalf of the government and on behalf of everyone here today for the recent fatality that have take place before respond to the essence of what he say want to make it clear that every death or serious injury on our road not just in north yorkshire but up and down the country be tragedy and we continue to work tirelessly to improve road safety for all user that be not just driver it be also pedestrian motorcyclist cyclist and mobility scooter user however the fact be that britain have some of the safe road in the world the most recent record show that people be kill and seriously injure on our road however that be clearly tragedy for any individual so affected and for their family and we want to work to address that want to make number of point speed calm measure be massive part of the hon gentleman speech local authority as he rightly identify have power under the highways act to install range of traffic calm measure road hump chicane and other such feature have all be prove to reduce inappropriate vehicle speed which as well as reduce the risk of collision lessen the severity of any that do occur there be also the ability to install other measure to improve road safety such as pedestrian crossing and mph speed limit the department for transport produce wide range of good practice advice to help our local authority to design and deliver such measure it be for the local council to decide what measure may be appropriate in different location take into account vast number of criterion the department do not set numerical criterion for footfall or collision number that must be meet to justify the installation of such safety measure local authority can choose to set their own criterion but that be decision for they now turn to the vexed issue of mph zone every member will be acutely aware that the introduction of not total but effective mph zone in wales have be singularly unpopular policy that have cause great concern and it be certainly not something that the government support on the other hand as far as be aware not single member of parliament be against the concept of mph zone around school there have to be happy medium and that be local authority decision there be all manner of different factor include how zone will influence quality of life road safety the environment and the local economy local authority should also take into account the department plan for driver to assist they we be update the mph speed limit guidance for england to ensure consistency ask for the road safety statistic for the hon gentleman constituency date back some considerable time and my source be the datum adjust for change in reporting system there be ksi kill or seriously injure casualty on an adjusted basis in compare with in we all accept that all the number be too high there be much criticism of both the local authority and this government but gently point out that labour be in government in there be significant difference and the number have be in double figure since one can bandy around statistic but it be clear that the number have come down significantly there be couple of key point to note first there have clearly be significant investment in north yorkshire with the kex gill scheme the jock lodge junction improvement the york outer ring road dualling and the improvement scheme merely make the point that those road improvement have inevitably improve safety the minister will have see that yesterday york and north yorkshire combined authority be allocate million from the local transport fund when we have local mayor in place could that money be use to fund road safety improvement through capital project the answer be yes quite simply it be legitimate to say that this new money for area across the country which be announce only yesterday be result of the prime minister decision on the second leg of high speed billion seven year local transport fund have be make available to large number of local authority outside the city region city region receive city region sustainable transport settlement in the north and midland the ltf include billion for local authority in the north and billion for local authority in the midland and that funding will be available from april this allow local authority and combined authority to plan and set their process to consult in the appropriate way and then to deliver the york and north yorkshire combined authority will receive million correct my hon friend by million from the local transport fund which will be game change there be much criticism of the local authority but meet keane duncan local representative and member of parliament when visit the region at the beginning of january be impress by their commitment to try to do transformational work for north yorkshire which include make the case for further funding as my hon friend outline we have be delighted to set forth and provide that it can bring about road improvement pelican crossing road safety measure and traffic calm measure and can address other particular point the guidance will be publish shortly but the fact that it be dramatic new money to assist with specific transport policy can only be welcome wish to make few extra point road safety be determined fundamentally by individual driver we should all acknowledge that we can throw brickbat at local authority or government but we require driver to change their way when my hon friend be in the department for transport he institute change to the highway code and to the drive test the test that those of we of more advanced year take be dramatically different from the one take by someone of more recent year and the highway code be also dramatically different it include hierarchy of road user and make it very clear that there be great degree of reliance upon safety we be conscious that the driver need to be well qualified there be no comparison between the old test and the new test that have make difference which can be see in the reduction in the number that we see in the safety statistic that be just the tip of the iceberg and wish to set out some of the other government intervention that have be make the safe road fund have invest million to fund scheme take the total funding to tackle our most dangerous road to million over scheme since we have make intervention to legislate to address some of the most dangerous activity on our road clearly the rule on mobile phone have change we have also increase the sentence for cause death by dangerous driving or careless driving while under the influence of drink or drug from year to life imprisonment we have increase the disqualification period for those cause death by dangerous driving or death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drug from two year to five we have also undertake number of project to improve the safety of our road include the road police review whereby the number of force put road police in their police and crime plan have increase from to with now include road safety road policing have be strategic policing requirement since february that sound techy but it genuinely make difference our project radar be systematic investigation that be create new opportunity to combine and compare datum across departments arm length body and police that be identify and intercept the most dangerous vehicle on our road could go on this be wonderful debate and commend the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather for bring it to the floor of the house thank the minister for permit to intervene he will be very aware of my interest in the increase in insurance premium as we have westminster hall debate on that last week people be now decide not to insure their vehicle and still go on the road which be increase risk do he agree that action be need to ensure that we support young driver to get on the road but to do so safely will he far consider the graduated driver licensing scheme which believe would help with that safety element for young people the hon lady be continue in rich tradition establish by her illustrious colleague the hon member for strangford jim shannon we miss he in the debate today but we take she as very able replacement her debate last week be attend by number of colleague and have have chance to read it should have be respond to it but happen to be respond to the adjournment debate in this place at the same time and as we all know nobody can be in two place at the same time in the house of commons so apologise but the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for south cambridgeshire anthony browne sit in for at that debate will take away the comment that the hon lady make today and in last week debate and write to she in more detail if she would be so gracious as to allow to do so take on board that there be clearly ongoing issue in respect of insurance we be work with insurance company there have be issue around raise the price of insurance that be quite frankly beyond the government control she make some legitimate point on the matter and we want to address those that she raise both in the debate last week and today let back to the point make by the hon member for selby and ainsty there be certain key campaign change to the highway code and drive test be key because we be try to change driver behaviour that be the most important thing we can rail against individual piece of road but change the behaviour of driver be the real way to improve road safety the department for transport think campaign continue to target the most at risk group its aim be to reduce the number of people kill and seriously injure on the road by change attitude and behaviour could go on in more detail but will make couple of final point the safe road fund have undertake key project in north yorkshire include for the for the million for the and million for the those be substantial investment that the government have make in the past substantial investment will also follow yesterday announcement which make this debate all the more relevant to conclude congratulate the hon member for selby and ainsty on secure his first debate he raise important point for his local community and be certain they will be take on board would gently push back on the point he make about local statistic the action of his local authority and the complexity of the issue the key point be that it be in all our interest to try to improve road safety up and down the country question put and agree to house adjourn
