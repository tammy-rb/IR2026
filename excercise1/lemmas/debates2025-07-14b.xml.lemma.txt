be grateful to have secure today adjournment debate on an issue that affect community across the country the condition of our road although will focus on the situation in cheshire and in my constituency of chester south and eddisbury and on what believe be failure by local authority to get to grip with the issue will begin by set the context and reflect on the broad systemic problem with how we repair and maintain our road network the public accounts committee recently publish report on the condition and maintenance of local road in england it show that this problem be widespread that the department for transport do not have good grasp of the real condition of local road in england and that fund arrangement to local authority be likely to be push they to focus spending on short term reactive work in my view this reactive rather than proactive approach to road maintenance in cheshire urgently need to change instead of neglect route be identify and tackle particularly in rural area we see pattern of piecemeal catch up on individual pothole rather than long term cost effective repair that offer real value for money
