gentleman to walk through the lobby with the government when our bus services no bill come forward it be exactly design to take back control of our bus service which the conservative party completely and spectacularly fail to do the bill will empower local leader to choose model that work well for their area it include as mention socially necessary local service measure local transport authority that operate under an enhanced partnership will be require to identify local service that they consider to be socially necessary and put in place requirement that must be follow before such service

do the secretary of state agree that government fund infrastructure must be safe and accessible for everyone and will she commit to review active travel guidance to consider the role of float bus stop that put blind and visually impair people at risk during the passage of the bus services no bill in the other place we commit to write to all local transport authority ask they to pause the installation of specific kind of float bus stop where passenger get off the bus straight into cycle lane or an island that be because they have be identify through research as problematic for people particularly those with vision report july vol correction we have already do work with active travel england and transport for london to identify design standard fundamentally this government believe

project with bus operator bus manufacturer and mayor across the country to try to forge smooth pipeline of order to support our fantastic uk manufacturer the government know that bus franchising be commercially risky and very expensive for any local authority we know that because transport for london cost taxpayer million year in subsidy and andy burnham bee network in greater manchester be currently on course for an annual deficit of million when its business plan be for forecast profit what be the point of give risky franchising power to every local authority in the country when the government do not provide the money to support they will not take any lecture from the conservatives under whose watch we see million few bus mile as have explain to the hon gentleman in committee and in various exchange the full fat franchising as it be commonly know in greater manchester be only one kind of franchising available to local authority various other method be available to different area include the model adopt in place such as jersey which be partnership between the private operator and the local transport authority so that they can benefit from its skill and knowledge do not recognise and have correct this in committee the figure that the hon gentleman quote for greater manchester which be perform fantastically deliver well more affordable green smoother and reliable service for the people of manchester be grateful for that answer and we have four hour of bill committee later today to rehearse the argument yet again in an early answer the minister say that he be provide billion of support for bus in this financial year but surely he know that million go to help local authority navigate the huge administrative burden that come with franchising and the other scheme that the government have in mind that leave just million for actual bus service across the whole of england that be only enough to satisfy andy burnham for year yet we have full fat be pursue by liverpool and west midlands ask again where be the money to support those ambition as the hon gentleman be aware place such as greater manchester be part of the group of authority that have receive billion to spend in their local area it be important to recognise the extraordinary performance of bus in greater manchester once again we be not tell local area which model to adopt for bus it could be franchise or enhanced partnership as well as remove the barrier to municipal bus company passenger rail performance cumbria what step she be take to help improve passenger rail performance in

important work call the shadow secretary of state both grand central and hull train have see their passenger number increase dramatically since the pandemic by more than and respectively that be significant increase compare with other operator why do the right hon lady think that might be if the hon gentleman want to trade statistic on the rail network can tell he that we have see massive increase in passenger number on transpennine express and lner in fact last year we have overall increase in passenger journey and passenger revenue overall go up from billion to billion which be good news for the taxpayer and clear sign that people want to come back and use our railway be not hop to trade statistic be hop that the right hon lady would answer the question will provide the answer it be because they be open access operator they have to compete for passenger by provide service that passenger want at price they be prepared to pay and it be clearly work why have the government indicate to the industry that they be not supportive of open access by state their opposition to eight of the nine proposal submit in february have say repeatedly at this dispatch box that we see role for open access operator when they open up new market and add value we have to balance that against the revenue that they abstract from the public sector operator we can not have situation in which we

government this be armed forces week as the house will know it be time to celebrate and champion all those who serve and have serve in our armed force and nowhere more than in my own county of herefordshire we must also note that far from celebrate the armed force this government deliberately open the door last year to unfair and vexatious prosecution of veteran who serve decade ago in northern ireland and they have keep that door open what else the original abortion act be debate for more than year but the government allow no notice for public debate on the abortion amendment last week and they give just two hour of debate in the chamber on the big change in abortion law in nearly year whatever one think of the merit of the issue that be scandalously bad way to make legislation what else defence ministers be leave out of the loop on the us bombing of iran nuclear facility and be unable to say whether they support this action by our close ally government whip resign express her deep concern over the welfare bill and the government have promise to bring the bill forward next week as we have just hear let we see if they do talk of turn the government have only just turn on the winter fuel payment and again on groom gang last week have prepare themselves for turn on the two child benefit cap less than year since they suspend seven labour mp for vote against the cap this be just one week be it any wonder that the prime minister personal reputation have continue to plummet only yesterday the times of london say not quite year have pass since his landslide general election victory and already his political stock be trade at junk status akin to zimbabwean dollar or weimar papiermark mr speaker you may recall from your intimate knowledge of german history that the papiermark be monetary instrument that lead to hyper inflation and political collapse that be come from the times of london shall we dig little bit far into one specific reason why the prime minister reputation might have fall so much follow the record pay settlement of last year the junior doctor have announce that they be excited at the idea of six month of strike action meanwhile hospital consultant be ballot to see if they will strike as well doctor receive increase last year after labour take office and now the junior doctor be apparently demand further pay increase of these be eye water number and of course we will all end up pay if the increase be grant but be afraid this be exactly what we would expect from government who have tax and splurge the cash since the election it be hardly surprising that the union now think they have an open door to extract money from the treasury and the government have actually make the situation even bad through their rolling programme of nationalisation and by abolish nhs england whatever else it may have be nhs england act as firebreak on union lobbying because it operate semi independently of ministers by abolish it the government have now remove one of the few mean they have to face down extortionate demand for more pay and more restrictive practice the same be true with the railway as each one be nationalise include south west railway only last week so the obstacle to the union demand be progressively be remove the house will recall the massive pay settlement give to the rail union last year with no attempt to negotiate any efficiency gain it be only matter of time before those union come back for more as the doctor be do these be not pay bargain they be an abject surrender of course ministers themselves do not mind after all of they be report to be union member as far as can see the leader of the house be an exception she be not union member and all credit to she for that be ah okay be very sorry to say that the leader of the house have correct she be in fact union member and therefore fully complicit in the same problem the treasury itself be now the only hold out against union demand little wonder the chancellor have look so unhappy and out of sort and that be before the deputy prime minister start leak memo call for billion of pound year in tax increase the union know the government be vulnerable and they have come back for more labour back benchers also know that the government be run scared and lead by their select committee chairs they be start to get organise can the leader of the house positively and personally now confirm that the welfare bill vote will take place next tuesday may start by wish two deputy speakers happy birthday hon member hear hear as the right hon gentleman say this be armed forces week when we thank and show our support for the man and woman who serve or who have serve in our armed force over many year it be nice to see the right hon gentleman in his place again this week because we have miss he quite bit recently but might gently suggest that if he have be here last week he could have ask last week question last week instead of ask they this week he ask about the welfare bill as have just announce to the house the second reading of the universal credit and personal independence payment bill will take place next tuesday and the remain stage of the bill will take place on the floor of the house the following week want to reassure colleague that we take parliamentary scrutiny and the process of bills extremely seriously that be what our parliamentary democracy be all about bill be introduce principle be consider at second reading and the detail receive robust debate and discussion and be often amend in committee before we consider third reading as the house would expect the government actively engage with parliamentary opinion throughout bill passage as we be do intensively with the universal credit and personal independence payment bill be sure that the whole house can agree that our welfare system need reform too many people be consign to benefit for life without support to work and to get on during the pandemic in particular the number of those on sickness and disability benefit rise significantly and the previous government do nothing to re engage people with the labour market afterwards one in eight young people be now not earn or learn many post industrial community have be scar over generation by worklessness and little job creation as constituency mp we have all see the inadequate and frankly degrade nature of disability benefit reassessment address these deep seat problem be at the core of our labour principle and what we be try to do with our welfare reform just remind colleague that these include the big permanent increase to the standard out of work benefit since an end to reassessment for all those with serious health condition create more holistic and professionally lead assessment process the big back to work programme in generation the right to try work and end the era of consign people as unable to work to be clear it be the conservatives legacy that this government now have to sort out their legacy of one in working age people on sickness or disability benefit their legacy of generation of young people with no mental health support and poor skill their legacy of over million people on nhs waiting list and their legacy of inaction on welfare reform over year and year quite honestly the right hon gentleman have brass neck because the conservatives have write the book on government chaos have they not there be three prime ministers in three year they send the market into chaos with budgets do on the back of fag packet they really do write the book on that one there be by election after by election for misconduct over ministers resign in single day billion be waste on crony covid contract public service be leave on their knee and industrial action be sweep the country cost we all dear all of that leave ordinary people pay the price with high bill high mortgage and long waiting list however this be not just about welfare reform it be also about the context in which this sit in and that be what this government be get on with do this government mission to create good decent well pay job in every community this government mission to bring down waiting list and deal with the deep seat health inequality in this country this government mission to tackle child poverty this government mission to build more affordable and social housing give people bedrock in life and this government mission to revolutionise skill and opportunity for young people that be this labour government with our labour value get on with the job and deliver for people rise order be go to allow business question to run only until be because of the important statement that be to follow so ask members to help each other and there will be good example from afzal khan know that many colleague in the house share my frustration with the leasehold and management company that leverage excessive and ambiguous service charge on leaseholder and tenant in my constituency be face ongoing problem with glide property management which demand unreasonably large sum from constituent without provide suitable service and which be refuse to respond to the numerous complaint that have subsequently be submit to it do the leader of the house agree that such company should not continue take advantage of leaseholder and tenant and must be hold fully accountable for all complaint fully share my hon friend frustration with our leasehold system and the charge and difficulty that many leaseholder face he will know that we be act quickly to implement the provision of the leasehold and freehold reform act and there be more come on that very soon include the measure to drive up the transparency of service charge and ensure that they can be challenge more easily by leaseholder call the liberal democrat spokesperson join the leader of the house in congratulate the deputy speakers on their birthday and in celebrate our armed force early this year when the secretary of state for work and pensions announce the welfare reform her argument to this house be that they be all about get people back into work that argument be undermine somewhat by the timing in the spring statement the follow week we discover that the billion saving we achieve from the welfare reform make up fully half of the fiscal headroom that the chancellor be rely on when we take close look at the reform we find that most of the saving be generate by change to the eligibility criterion for the personal independence payment entitlement to pip be give to those in work those out of work and those unable to work it follow that many of those who stand to lose out as result of the reform will not be incentivise into work because they will already be in work or will be unable to join the workforce any time soon no wonder then that when the bill be publish last week there be condemnation from all side of the house if the book need to be balance we need to make sure that they be not balance on the back of the disabled the leader of the house will be well aware of all the rumour circulate around this place that the government be prepare to make concession on the universal credit and personal independence payment bill what be the procedure for do that we understand that reasoned amendment if one be table would kill the bill off entirely what be the option for the government to make concession will they have to withdraw the bill and re present it or be there some other mechanism by which they can make compromise with their back benchers before next week welcome the hon gentleman to his place he have do very good job of stand in for his excellent colleague the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman with whom also

many government bills bring in this session that have not be amend during their passage most bills be amend and those amendment be usually make in committee and on report be sure that this bill will be consider in the usual way during its parliamentary passage the leader of the house extol the virtue of parliamentary democracy yet over half of mp reject the universal credit and personal independence payment bill we have speak to our constituent and to organisation represent disabled people they reject the bill because it will cause harm to disabled people their voice have not be hear much though we be try to amplify they in this place will the leader of the house urge the cabinet to withdraw the bill and instead allow general debate on how we support disabled people my hon friend have campaign on these issue for long time we have not yet vote on or even consider the bill we will have an extensive and be sure thorough parliamentary process in which to do that ask colleague to

will update the house on the and nato summit where the middle east be at the forefront of our mind for decade it have be the state policy of the uk and our ally that iran must never obtain nuclear weapon no one who care about the security of our country or the future of the middle east could live with that eventuality for decade we have work to prevent it and on saturday night the us take big step towards resolve that threat there be now window for peace we urge iran and israel to honour the ceasefire and seize this opportunity to stabilise the region that be our priority to get iran back around the negotiating table with the us ultimately that be how we will ensure complete verifiable and irreversible end to iran nuclear programme we be use every diplomatic lever to support that effort because further instability would pose grave risk to the region and beyond take we even far away from free the hostage and ease the intolerable suffering of the palestinians there be also an opportunity now to push for ceasefire in gaza and we must seize it have be discuss this with other leader and we will keep push to put the region on well path have also speak to the emir of qatar to

uncertainty face with grow conflict state threat illegal migration organised crime and terrorism the only way to respond to these issue be by be strong both at home and on the world stage by pursue foreign policy that answer directly to the concern of work people that be the approach take to nato and to the nato be the most successful military alliance the world have ever know and the cornerstone of our defence for over year our duty be not merely to reflect on that success we must equip the alliance for the future have long argue that this be the moment for europe to make fundamental shift in posture that be what the uk have do deliver the big sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war and set out landmark shift in our defence and deterrence in the strategic defence review yesterday nato ally step up as well to meet this moment and create an alliance that be strong fair and more lethal than ever together we sign new defence investment pledge of of gdp by include for the first time wide issue of homeland security and national resilience like protect our cyber security and our energy network this be in lockstep with our national security strategy and we be already invest in these area under nato new definition we estimate that we will reach at least of gdp in on the way to by ally also agree to review both the balance and the trajectory of these requirement in to coincide with the scheduled review of nato capability requirement ensure that we keep pace with threat and technology as they evolve with this historic commitment we be continue our proud tradition of lead in nato pick up the torch from attlee and bevin and now follow their lead we will seize the opportunity create by this moment to align our national security objective and plan for economic growth in way not see since the renew industrial community the length and breadth of our country boost defence production and innovation our investment in britain nuclear deterrent alone will support high skilled job want to speak directly about our deterrent capability it have keep this country safe for decade but we recognise the grim reality today that the nuclear threat be grow so we be renew our exist at sea capability and we be go far still can tell the house today that we will procure at least fast jet and we will make they available to bear nuclear weapon if necessary that mark the return of the royal air force to nuclear deterrence for the first time in three decade the big strengthening of our deterrence posture in generation keep our country safe while also support job the nato summit send message of intent that will be hear around the world but this must be join by renew support for ukraine because if we let putin succeed there the deterrent effect of nato new plan would be fatally compromise so tell president zelensky at downing street on monday that we will harden our resolve we strike an agreement together to share battlefield technology accelerate our support for ukraine defence while boost british security and british job we commit to provide hundred more air defence missile pay for not by the british taxpayer but with money from russia frozen asset and together with europe canada and our indo pacific partner we announce that we will deliver billion of military aid to ukraine this year match last year pledge in full there be path to just and last peace but it will only come through flip the pressure on to putin his position be weak than he claim so urge all our partner include the us to step up the pressure now with more sanction and more military support to bring russia to the table to agree an unconditional ceasefire lead to serious negotiation let turn to the summit where again my priority be to deliver in the national interest again can report some significant progress leader agree to take decisive action on illegal migration follow the uk lead in use hard head measure such as sanction we mark an export contract with canada worth over million create job here at home we secure canada agreement to ratify britain entry to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific

have look those worker in the eye and know what this mean to they their family and their whole community that be who be represent at summit like this the work people of britain navigate this world require cool head it defy simplistic answer and knee jerk judgment we do not pretend that we can fix every global problem but we can carve unique path through these dangerous time to secure and renew britain in an era of global instability that be what our plan for change be all about put britain national interest first after year of economic chaos we have deliver economic stability for the british people after year of our armed force be hollow out we be build up our military fire up our industry lead in nato support ukraine and keep britain safe after year of fray alliance we be rebuild and shape they to serve the british people we have focus every ounce of our global influence to deliver for work people and to deliver in the national interest and commend this statement to the house call the leader of the opposition thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement he have evade prime minister question for two week only to come back here to tell we what we already hear on the news this be weak statement from weak prime minister which can be characterise in two word noise off in his statement the prime minister say we urge iran and israel to honour the ceasefire he say we be use every diplomatic lever to support this effort what diplomatic lever be they the same lever he be use with his back bench rebel be he just ask they to please play nice let we be honest nobody care what this prime minister think why should they when he do not even know what he think clearly no one care what he think because he be not involve we use to be strategic player on the global stage advance britain interest with order you may not wish to hear the leader of the opposition but do it do not do anybody good in this chamber to try to shout down somebody who be speak labour members can shout as much as they like but we all know the truth we use to be strategic player on the global stage advance britain interest with confidence and now we be on the sideline over the last few week historic event unfold in the middle east and at every stage britain have be out of step with the us and out of the loop with israel last week the prime minister come back from the insist that there be nothing president trump say that would indicate he be about to get involve in this conflict day later the us launch its attack on iran nuclear facility and the prime minister have no idea what be go on the week before israel launch an attack on iran and it become apparent that the uk be not even inform about the attack in advance despite we have be involve in previous preventive action how be that stand up on the world stage on tuesday the foreign secretary lawyer repeatedly could not say whether the us strike against iran nuclear facility be legal this be government who do not know what they be do let make the conservative position clear iran have be direct threat to the uk for year plot terrorism on british soil it must not get nuclear weapon this be time for europe to step up and the uk should be lead instead we have an attorney general use international law to constrain and restrict the uk while the prime minister hover indecisively on the sideline what we need be leader instead we have three lawyer last week write to the prime minister about how this conflict have underscore the folly of the government billion chagos surrender deal the diego garcia base be of obvious strategic importance for conflict in the middle east interruption labour member be shake their head they do not understand it be obvious diego garcia be use extensively during the war in afghanistan include by the united states at prime minister question the prime minister say that this chagos surrender have be oppose by our adversary russia china and report june vol since then it have be widely report that china have offer massive congratulation on the deal and convey that it fully support mauritius will the prime minister now admit that he be incorrect to state on the floor of this house that china oppose the chagos deal and can he confirm whether he still view china as an adversary under the term of the prime minister deal if the us be to launch an attack from the military base on diego garcia we would have to inform the chinese ally mauritius government will he abandon the deeply flawed surrender deal if not when will he introduce the legislation set out the detail of the chagos surrender so that parliament can consider and debate it we welcome the announcement that the uk will be buy fighter jet and be pleased that the labour party have now move on from its previous position of not support nato and advocate against the nuclear deterrent interruption labour members pretend that it never happen but we have the receipt conservative be proud of exceed the nato baseline of of gdp spend on defence and we lead nato in get there however the government aspiration to get spending on national security to be just hope the reality be that labour do not have plan to get to it be all smoke and mirror and we do not know what the government will spend the extra component on can the prime minister confirm whether this be money we be already spend or whether there will be any new money so long as this plan remain unfunded these be just word instead of use smoke and mirror to inflate defence spending labour should heed our call to hit by the end of this parliament with fully fund plan to get there look at the money the government claim they be go to save through their welfare billion be nowhere near the ten if not hundred of billion we be go to need to find if we be to meet that defence spending target this be the problem mr speaker it be one thing to talk about spend money on plane and infrastructure and to make announcement about review but it be another to be clear about where the money will come from and how it will be spend efficiently to secure the defence of our nation interruption labour member can mutter all they like we all know that they be terrify of do anything that be even remotely difficult it be crucial that there be clear united front in full support of ukraine that secure peace on ukraine term the stake could not be high we need the government to be leverage british influence in every way they can for ukraine so can the prime minister tell we whether he push for clear language in the nato communiqué about russia be the aggressor in this conflict can he update we on the uk current position on ukraine accession to nato give the absence of detail in this year communiqué we must ensure that our lead role continue but that require strong leadership and an ability to influence the prime minister may have finally return to this house after fortnight away but in truth he be all at sea irrelevant on the world stage and impotent in the face of rise illegal immigration now with of his own mps openly undermine his authority his government be incapable of make even the small change to bring down the cost of our ever expand welfare bill there be no way that they be go to be able to pay for our defence this be government who be paralyse by their own legal advice paralyse by their rebellious back benchers and paralyse by the fear of be find out for have no real vision for this country rise order say to those who be late into the chamber please do not stand call the prime minister we live in more volatile time than many of we can remember with conflict in many part of the world that be evolve in very fast and dangerous way there have never be more important time to work with our ally and to be absolutely serious in our response that response be unserious to suggest at time like this that the prime minister attend the summit and the nato summit be avoid pmq be unserious what happen at nato yesterday be historic it be very important that at time like nato show unity and strength with commitment to the future not just to the past that take huge amount of work with our ally over the last few day and week we be centrally involve in that craft the final outcome and be recognise as have do so be proud that we help put that summit into the right place yesterday and the world emerge safe as result that be the unanimous view of ally on leave nato yesterday for the leader of the opposition to belittle it just show how irrelevant she and her party be become they use to once be serious about these issue and they use to be capable of cross party consensus but all of that be slip away we have lead on ukraine and secure three trade deal the right hon lady talk about the prospect of us attack she must have overlook the fact that on tuesday when return from the the first thing do be go straight into cobra meeting to plan for all contingency include possible us attack on iran will tell she why do that although we do offer privy council briefing so she know this we have military personnel co locate in nearly all the basis across the middle east and be therefore extremely concerned immediately upon my return to take every step to ensure that have the high level of assuredness that we have the preparation in place to keep our people and our asset safe should the need arise far from be blindside we be plan through last week we be talk to the americans and we be put on notice about everything they do she simply do not understand the nature of the relationship at that level in relation to diego garcia let disabuse the right hon lady we do not have to give mauritius advance notice under the treaty that be absolutely clear the right hon lady talk about defence spend we be the party that have increase defence spend to the high level since the cold the conservatives talk about it we do it she say we do not know where the money be come from but she be press on this in an interview not so long ago and she say that we talk about get to by and we could make the number work she go on we need to find way to make the number work be intrigue by this interview and think she be about to lay it out then she say this sort of thing require real thinking then she say let start look at what we can do it about we set up task force that be how unserious they be the right hon lady ask about the ukraine communiqué as she will know have she actually study it the way that nato work be an iterative process therefore the position on ukraine have not change for nato and it have not change under this government on the contrary we be recognise as lead on ukraine and as the close ally of ukraine work with they the whole time that be something be proud of think it be something the house be proud of because we have be do this on cross party basis and the soon we get back to that rather than the unserious response of the leader of the opposition the well call the chair of the select committee in the year since the election of this labour government britain be back as force for good on the world stage follow the outbreak of conflict in the middle east last week be proud to see the prime minister lead call for calm cool head and de escalation in its aftermath we must take seriously the renew defence commitment that the prime minister have make at nato but we must also proudly wield the soft convening and convincing power that the uk have in spade that soft power have historically be the key to successful diplomatic effort in iran secure the joint comprehensive plan of action and in the wide middle east and around the world can the prime minister confirm what the foreign affairs committee have learn from our conversation with our european ally which be that britain be quietly and effectively step up to lead the fight against russian disinformation and cyber warfare and that the investment we will be put in will be well spend thank my right hon friend for her question and she be absolutely right the need to de escalate be the central focus go into the weekend and come out of it and be very pleased that we have reach ceasefire in relation to the conflict in iran we absolutely need that to hold my right hon friend be absolutely right about the soft convening power of the united kingdom it be an incredible asset and yes can confirm that we be work with other in relation to russian disinformation and cyber attack which as the house know be regular occurrence call the leader of the liberal democrats thank the prime minister for early sight of his statement the liberal democrats agree that it would have be wrong to leave an empty chair in front of the union jack at the table for the and nato it be astonishing and share his surprise that it be now conservative policy not to attend the and nato be glad that the prime minister have signal retreat on his welfare plan hope that he will now listen to everyone and not just his back benchers on the despite the progress that he outline it remain extremely damaging to the world economy that the united states and donald trump continue their policy of protectionism can the prime minister update the house on whether he have have discussion with other and indeed nato colleague about how we could persuade president trump to resile from protectionism on nato the prime minister be right to say that putin imperial ambition present once in generation threat to our security last week travel to estonia to meet british troop and estonian leader include prime minister michal the estonians have not forget the repression enforce by russian tank nor the murder of four former prime ministers at the hand of the kremlin they be under no illusion about the threat pose by putin and we must not be either so welcome the prime minister commitment to nato new spending target in the face of russia war machine the british army remain an essential guarantor of our country security and that of our ally when meet our incredible troop station in estonia be inspire by their skill and professionalism we need to get more brilliant people like they into the military so will the prime minister consider the liberal democrats proposal to move more quickly to reverse the conservatives cut to the army and back our new bonus for recruit it be vital that we take such measure as putin continue his barbarism in ukraine our commitment to ukraine defence must be increase not reduce in addition to the action that the prime minister outline can he confirm whether he have hold more discussion with partner on not just use the interest from frozen russian asset but seize those asset so that we can bolster our support for ukraine and pay for fast increase in defence spending the estonians believe they have plan to deal with all the complication that he mention when ask he question about this be he prepared to meet to discuss the estonians idea about how to break the backlog so that we can seize those asset the prime minister also speak about the conflict and crisis in the middle east he be right to push even hard for ceasefire in gaza people around the world will question whether military action rather than diplomacy will actually make we safe in the future we must redouble our effort for just peace in the region and that must include self determination for the palestinian people will the government finally commit to recognise state for the palestinians may thank the right hon gentleman for his question he start by ask whether have discuss with other partner the question of us tariff yes we frequently discuss trade the economy and frankly the challenge that those tariff put in place for all economy that be the sort of co ordination and discussion that go on all the time and it will continue on the troop in estonia have visit they number of time myself they be incredibly brave and they have real sense of purpose can tell the right hon gentleman that at nato the frontline state on the border with russia be lead the charge in relation to the work that we have to do yesterday to renew and take forward the pledge that we make the right hon member ask about reverse the cut to the army we will begin the work of reverse those cut when the conservatives come into government there be in our army when they leave there be think that be what ben wallace mean when he say they have hollow out our armed force on the question of the asset and whether they themselves can be seize rather than just use the interest have be discuss that with colleague as the right hon member would expect it be complicated as he know there be not one view frankly on this issue among colleague and ally be very happy to see the proposal that he have receive from estonia believe or any other but it remain complicated have to say that ally be in different place on this but we will continue to discuss it on ceasefire in gaza and recognition think it be very important that we have be press the case particularly in recent day quite urgently and in close collaboration with our colleague the of germany france and the uk be work very closely together at the moment to say that this be the moment to press on from iran to ceasefire in gaza and mean that that should happen in day not week or month do think there be window of opportunity here hope that it happen but can not predict that it will do think that all of we should do all we can to ensure that along with ceasefire in iran we push to that ceasefire in gaza on the question of recognition it have long be our party policy this government policy to recognise palestine at the right time in the process to bring about the peace because think that without two state solution there be little prospect of last peace in the region and that remain our policy last week as part of the armed force parliamentary scheme visit nato headquarters in the uk where meet fantastic young man and woman who be learn great skill as they prepare to defend britain abroad however my constituent when they see cut of such great amount for example as propose in the welfare bill may well ask why defence spending be rise for the benefit of my constituent could the prime minister simply and briefly set that out first congratulate my hon friend on her elevation have not see she personally since then which be very well deserved my hon friend raise really important point it be right that we recognise that the first duty of the prime minister be to keep the country safe and secure in volatile world and that be duty that take extremely seriously we do live in volatile world and it be not just something that happen overseas and have no impact on we what have happen in the ukraine conflict have already have an impact on her constituent in relation to their energy bill the cost of live and so much else we can see from the last week or two the impact that the conflict in iran be have on oil price which again have direct impact on her constituent so it be absolutely right and in our own interest that we take the necessary measure in relation to defence spend should also say that we be determined to ensure that as we spend more on defence that be reflect in good well pay job in the united kingdom include in her constituency on all three front that be the answer give to her constituent the iranian regime have long present threat to the united kingdom as the prime minister and have both experience our security service have foil almost iranian back plot here at home the prospect of such regime have nuclear weapon be unacceptable so welcome the us and israeli action do the prime minister agree with that we and our european ally should now trigger snapback sanction unless tehran admit the international atomic energy agency and allow it to fully verify that all effort to enrich enhance uranium have cease thank the right hon member for his question and endorse what he say about our security service which as he know very well do an incredible job in the most difficult of circumstance and at great speed and they have foil number of plot that would have cause widespread panic violence and destruction on snapback thank the right hon member for raise this that be consideration that we be discuss with our ally do think that it have to be part of the pressure that we apply exactly when and how snapback be apply will obviously be question for discussion but he be absolutely right to say that that be the very discussion we should be have at the moment and thank he welcome my right hon and learn friend statement and his commitment to increase defence expenditure but give that we be look to improve public service the health service social care education and the police be it realistic to do that within the current tax envelope have the time not come for we to review how we tax wealth as oppose to work to ensure that those who can bear the heavy load do so on defence spend when we set out the commitment to by set out at the same time how we would fund it we will continue to take that approach to any spending commitment we make my hon friend will know that we make commitment in our manifesto to not raise taxis on work people we will keep to that commitment welcome the element of the prime minister statement where he explicitly link defence diplomacy and domestic security he be absolutely right to highlight that interconnection therefore will he revisit the spending review which see and real term reduction in home office and foreign commonwealth and development office budget to make sure that they can actually do their job within that interconnect system to pay for that will he ensure that his chancellor remove the job destroy taxis on employment and reduce the tax burden which be see entrepreneur and wealth creator leave the country in their drove will he show real leadership and ensure that his back benchers do not prevent his front benchers reduce the cost of our welfare bill so we can pay for these incredibly important governmental function on home office responsibility for domestic security the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that be why it be important that under the new definition of nato resilience at home be now include because cyber attack be commonplace energy have be weaponise and many counter terrorism operation have to be carry out in relation to state threat we be very careful in the spending review to ensure that there be adequate money on all those threat go through that myself so can give he that assurance on money come in and out of the country he will no doubt want to celebrate that we have have record investment under this labour government in the past month billion include the single big investment of billion two day ago from amazon which be sign of confidence in this government that will be measure in many job across the country rochdale have be proud home for ukrainians ever since they be force to flee soviet starvation murder and oppression in the and so many in my constituency will warmly welcome the decision to send advanced air missile to ukraine build in britain and pay for by the interest on seized russian asset do the prime minister agree that russia not ukraine should pay the price for putin barbaric war yes do it be very important that when we send those missile to ukraine we emphasise first that we be support ukraine as we have do throughout and secondly that that be pay for not by the british taxpayer but with the interest on russian asset that have be freeze do the prime minister agree that in the context of the threat pose by putin we must provide more guidance and support to britons to prepare they for the possibility of future conflict and that that should involve national resilience campaign do think we need to focus on resilience in sense the shift to be reflection that national resilience be become ever more central in our own national defence in particular on cyber where there be frequent attack from other state energy where we have see from the ukraine conflict that energy have be weaponise and counter terrorism with state back action in this country many of which have be thwart but the hon lady be absolutely right that we need to do more on resilience while the prime minister be in his rightful place at the nato summit this week be in my constituency for the opening of the janet harvey hall million installation that will turbocharge shipbuilding in this country and put it in the service of our defence sector the prime minister know govan shipbuilding very well labour recognise that the defence of our country be now inextricably link with the growth of our economy and investment in our public service but that view be not universally share therefore ask the prime minister to urge the snp government to back our defence sector as we do for the sake of job and prosperity in glasgow south west and beyond urge the snp to back our defence spend and the job that bring with it but also our defence stance as understand its position the snp be against the single most effective capability we have which be our nuclear deterrent at time of the great volatility we have see for decade that be simply wrong in principle and urge the snp to change it at the nato summit be the prime minister able to add his voice to the congratulation and thank that the nato secretary general pay to president trump for the successful military strike on iran nuclear programme we have long argue that iran should not be capable of have nuclear weapon and what happen on saturday night be big step to alleviate that threat that be the subject of many comment at the nato summit along with the congratulation for the ceasefire that have now be broker and the emphasis we now need on get iran around the negotiating table because if it be to be irreversible and verifiable it be important that it be do through negotiation that be what we be focus on welcome the prime minister statement especially on defence politic be about priority and as know he know the most important responsibility of government be the defence of the country and its people echo the sensible point make by the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak sadly they be not make by those on the opposition front bench and in particular his point about our intelligence service who be the fine in the world there be those whom we will never know and never see but who have keep this place our democracy and our community safe will the prime minister assure that as we seek to invest more in defence there be particular focus on support our intelligence service my hon friend make good point our intelligence service do an incredible job and pay tribute to they as he will know from now on where the intelligence service be contribute to our national defence that will be include in our defence spend it will not be include in the be core defence as always understand but will be add to it take it to in it will not have escape anyone notice that while the prime minister be rightly away at the and nato summit he make ten of billion of pound of unfunded spending commitment yet next week he expect members of parliament to vote with he to remove money from disabled people who need help to go to the toilet how can he justify make moral argument for security abroad while remove security from disabled people at home as the hon gentleman will know when we announce the increase in defence spending we make it very clear where that money be come from and it be not come from welfare spend as he very well know do believe in the moral duty and it be moral duty to defend our country which mean work with our nato ally to ensure that we have the most effective deterrent he can not give lecture on the moral duty to protect our country while maintain position of cast aside the single most effective deterrent we have that be unserious recently visit nato air force base in poland as part of the armed force parliamentary scheme be take part in with the raf there see at first hand the importance of work closely with our nato ally to defend our nation and keep we secure as we witness the scramble to the sky to ward off russian fighter jet will the prime minister confirm that he be prioritise the wellbeing of our armed force personnel both at home and abroad so that they can continue to keep we and our ally safe thank my hon friend for her question it be of course armed forces week among other thing we have give the armed force their single big pay increase in many year and make strong commitment to other aspect include their accommodation it be important that we recognise and reflect what they do for our country and that we ensure we be able to retain the brilliance of our armed force very much welcome nato commitment to core defence spending and on broad definition by for all nato member state however the prime minister and the government have publish spend figure only up until when will they publish public spending plan for to be it not incumbent on they to show how the target of for core defence spending will be meet by the government otherwise it be just an unfunded promise as the hon gentleman will know when we present the strategic defence review we have already set out the path to and the ambition for think it be right that all nato ally have now agree the by subject of course to review in of both the trajectory and balance the reason for that as he will understand be that nato itself be review its capability in and the review will therefore coincide diplomacy be the good way to prevent and de escalate risk and ensure long term security what discussion take place on how to escalate the focus on diplomacy in the middle east in order to resolve the situation in gaza clearly the architecture be not deliver at pace as well as on the forget war in sudan thank my hon friend for her question reassure she that we be have discussion with other leader not just at nato and the but on daily basis about the architecture and the path and how we can use diplomacy to get to ceasefire in gaza and to much well place in sudan thank she for raise sudan which be not raise often enough we be do that at speed and be try to bring as many ally with we as possible if the iran ceasefire hold hope that it will that will create the space to say that now be the time for that ceasefire in gaza that be only the first step of course in the route first to recovery and then to two state solution after worrying start president trump have now strengthen nato both by extract promise of more money and with the positive comment he make at the end of the summit have the prime minister have chance to assess whether that mean that president trump love affair with vladimir putin be begin to cool first think it be really important that nato be unite in the way that it be last night and do not just mean the comment of president trump mean have the whole country on the same page at really important moment for nato the right hon gentleman will understand how much hard work guile and diplomacy go into ensure that be the outcome think there be real sigh of relief around the world that this be the position on putin we be urge that this be the moment to push far to get putin to the table for an unconditional ceasefire president zelensky have say for many week that he be prepared for those talk we discuss that as ally and have discuss it many time with president trump as the right hon gentleman would expect would the prime minister care to comment on what our adversary will think when they hear the leader of the opposition mistakenly say that we can not afford our defence commitment do such fatuous response keep our country safe no it do not it be frankly embarrassing to suggest that should not have be at nato or the and think the leader of the opposition back benchers recognise that that be not the traditional position of the conservative party and the soon the conservatives get back to their former position the well be there any discussion about the kill zone that currently constitute the provision of humanitarian aid in gaza yes there be there be real concern about the intolerable position in gaza and what we can do to alleviate it we have repeatedly say that it be intolerable and that the current arrangement for aid be never go to work and can not be maintain urgent diplomacy be under way to alleviate that situation and we will continue with those effort strongly welcome the prime minister announcement on defence spending especially during armed forces week do he agree that this be landmark historic commitment reflect both the scale of the threat that we face and this labour government commitment to the security and defence of our country agree with my hon friend the commitment be landmark it be very important it show the resolve of nato and it reflect the resolve of this labour government be pleased that we be closely involve in craft and bring together the agreement that be reach yesterday the democratic primary in the most cosmopolitan city in the world have demonstrate that people will no long support hypocritical and disingenuous politician be sure that the whole house agree that iran must not have nuclear weapon but as lawyer the prime minister will understand that the attack on iran by israel and the us do not engage the caroline principle which allow for pre emptive strike do the prime minister agree with that analysis if he do not can he say from the dispatch box that he support those attack if we all agree that iran should not have nuclear weapon it be about time that we do something about it what happen on saturday night be big step towards alleviate that threat which be important we now need to complete on that the way to do that be through the talk that be now need to get iran back to the table in order to make sure that the position be irreversible and can be verify and that be what we be focus on welcome the prime minister leadership in recognise the need for strategic response it have be year since the options for change defence review begin bring down defence spending from of gdp we have spend that dividend gamble that we would not need to defend our value and generation have benefit from that bet but now we must take our chip off the table and reinvest in our security do the prime minister agree that we must level with the public about the threat that we face and the cost of under investment in our armed force yes do agree that be why we have begin the hard work of reverse the damage do under the previous government my hon friend be right about the dividend that have be enjoy but we must now make sure that there be defence dividend that high spending in that area be reflect in good well pay job in the united kingdom that boost our economy across all part of our community the former prime minister have just welcome the us military action against iran at the weekend why can not the prime minister bring himself to welcome it too have say that we need to alleviate the threat and that we have take huge step towards alleviate the threat have discuss that with and nato colleague and with president trump everybody be very pleased that there be such unity on it the forced deportation of child be illegal under international law yet russia continue to steal ukraine future one child at time be the issue of ukraine steal child discuss with our ally what more be be do to return those child to their home and family thank my hon friend for raise the matter she have campaign hard on this it be central that if there be to be ceasefire and last peace in ukraine and hope that there be it must involve the return of the child we have discuss that many time and will continue to do so since the second world war our national security have be base broadly on three pillar our physical defence which the prime minister mention in his statement the alliance that we have build which he also mention and the international rule base order which he do not mention what discussion do he have at either summit about the importance of international law and the undermining of its credibility through the inconsistent way that it have be apply in the conflict in ukraine and in gaza in particular do he try to persuade president trump to lift the united states sanction on the international criminal court have long be an advocate of the international rule base order and discuss that regularly with ally nato itself be rule base framework and an important one at that we need to maintain these rule base system to make sure that they be fit for purpose would add that the same be true for trade and the economy as member of the cross party uk delegation to the nato parliamentary assembly have have the opportunity to meet ukrainian members of parliament who make the powerful case for continue support from nato ally it have become clear in recent month that other country in the region poland and the baltic state of estonia lithuania latvia be grow ever more nervous about their vulnerability to invasion by russia can the prime minister comment on the uk effort and dialogue with those country at this unsettling time do he agree that the security of the baltic state be important for our national security my hon friend be absolutely right that the baltic state be incredibly nervous at the moment that have be the case for the past three year or so we engage with they regularly and engage with their leader regularly they have be bring into the coalition of the willing and on the occasion when they can not attend have special session with they because their concern be of such importance to we welcome the increase to defence spending and the revise target early this year at the spring statement we see cut to official development assistance the overseas aid budget to fund defence increase the oda budget be integral to our international security abroad so will the prime minister rule out any further cut to this budget for defence spending increase the hon member be right to emphasise the importance of overseas aid and that be difficult decision want to put it back up to rather than take it down in the meantime be explore other way that we can find funding for overseas aid and work with other country to that end because do not think that we can just wait until we be in position to increase the funding again welcome the prime minister statement today and the leadership that he be show on the world stage in really uncertain time which beyond the confine of this place know be genuinely welcome in my community in hertford and stortford as we mark armed forces week veteran and servicemen in my constituency will welcome the government commitment to strengthen our national security so for the benefit of my constituent can the prime minister set out little more how we be support our armed force to keep we safe and honour the service of veteran across the country let first pay tribute to the veteran in my hon friend constituency and across the country we have already put in place number of initiative particularly in relation to homelessness and veteran and more broadly in relation to accommodation and the support for not just veteran but our armed service personnel that be vital not only as reflection of their contribution but to ensure that we deal with the retention crisis among those serve which be cause by the conservative party although we may disagree on the detail agree with the prime minister that as far as possible in this place it would be well to keep partisan politic out of national security issue who know may get the whip withdraw for say that but so be it there be thing that go beyond party politic thank the prime minister for all his hard work in the national security interest of this country on the the prime minister mention sanction in his statement he say that he urge the united states to do more on sanction be he aware that the united states be actually urge the united kingdom to do more on sanction when it come to russia can the magnitsky legislation be widen and deepen so that it capture more russian asset and possibly other country that may have sanction impose on they soon for example georgia the joint expeditionary force be mention at the nato summit the prime minister will know have attend the norway meeting some week ago that ukraine be jef partnership nation do the uk support ukraine become full member of the joint expeditionary force if so when might that happen thank the right hon member for his question they be all good one so will endeavour to answer each part of they sanction be be discuss intensely as he will understand and there be two element the first be the immediate application of sanction in relation to russia we be attempt to ensure that we all act together the us the uk and the eu that be the focus of our discussion and what we be urge on the us the right hon member will know that there be piece of legislation in the us that be ready to go that need to be co ordinated with what we be do in the long term we need to look always at whether there be more we can do within the framework on sanction and we can discuss that in this house the right hon member raise an important point about ukraine and the jef we have be lead advocate of ukraine have role in the jef ukraine already have an enhance partnership with the jef the first of its kind that be do the last jef meeting that we have in norway few month ago where we be one of the lead nation push for that great involvement we will see over time whether that partnership can be take far either with the jef or nato but it be an important first step not only reflection for ukraine but also message to russia thank the prime minister for his leadership in represent we around the world in the last two week exactly where he should be do the prime minister want to remind the conservatives that it be labour government who last spend of gdp on defence and can he set out how increase our defence spending will keep our country safe and support high quality manufacturing job in west bromwich and the whole nation be happy to remind the house that we have of gdp on defence spending under the last labour government and we will have it under this labour government in long year the conservatives do not do that welcome the increase in defence spending will the prime minister take this opportunity to explain where the money be come from particularly as his government continue to weaken our economy and when another expensive benefit turn on top of the winter fuel turn be on its way the right hon lady must have miss the record investment in our country in the last month of billion the four interest rate cut and the fast growth in the in the first quarter of this year every time we have increase defence spending as we do with the we have at the same time set out where the money be come from find the leader of the opposition incredibly disappointing so goodness know what those on her own benches think while she be talk britain down may commend the prime minister for the leadership he have show this week could he say little more about how business in the defence supply chain particularly in the teesside defence and innovation cluster can contribute to the national mission for defence and security there be two or three principle here first we need to see the increase to our defence spend reflect in good well pay job in constituency across the country secondly the big sector in defence will obviously benefit but we have also put together hub for small supply chain business which whether defence specific or not be in pretty well every constituency to ensure that they take advantage of the contract and extra spending on defence in that way we can ensure that there be dividend back in the united kingdom from the extra spend we be put in place there have be some recent confusion from defence ministers surround the purchase of nuclear capable fast jet can the prime minister please inform the house of the propose in service date for this important capability we make the commitment to that capability and we be now talk to ally about precisely what the timetable will be will update the house the important thing be that the commitment be there it be commitment to the nato initiative and it bring we within that initiative therefore there be lot of move part but we have make very firm commitment and will set out the timeline and progress on that in due course hard power bbc world service soft power do the prime minister agree that the world service be crucial element of our soft convening power yes have long be supporter of the bbc world service my hon friend question chime with other question about the soft power of this country we have incredible soft power and incredible strength in our diplomacy and that very often achieve result in way that then make it less necessary to use the hard power there be scepticism in my constituency that the increase in defence spending might create good local job there as have already pitch to the chancellor and the defence secretary and early this month to the minister for defence procurement and industry alongside my local authority ceo know that huntingdon be recognise as the home of uk defence intelligence capability and of us operation in europe as well as nato give that of the equipment budget be now pledge for develop new technology along with the million defence innovation fund will the prime minister back my commitment to leverage the designation of raf wyton as ministry of defence trailblazer site to build defence technology cluster that will create highly technical local job and build new defence capability from huntingdon think the hon member be in discussion with ministers about this and we look forward to take that forward in relation to the scepticism of his huntingdon constituent reassure they that this increase defence spend will bring yield to huntingdon in the defence specific sector and in the supply chain welcome the prime minister statement and his leadership the international development committee recently publish report show that international humanitarian law be under threat like never before and that attack on aid worker be rise can the prime minister assure the house that the uk will be champion for ihl and could he elaborate on conversation about uphold it in relation to gaza as well as sudan and the many other country around the world ravage by conflict we have an absolute commitment to international humanitarian law and it be extremely important that we keep to that whether in gaza or sudan it be the framework through which we make our decision when it come to the evil of terrorism and aggression across the middle east all path lead back to the iranian regime be that the sponsorship of hamas hezbollah the houthis or indeed at the heart of the regime the islamic revolutionary guard corps although fully appreciate that the prime minister will not speculate on proscription from the dispatch box will he at least reflect on how it can be that despite call from both side of the house over many year to proscribe the irgc it still have not happen not least give that he take the right and proper action to proscribe palestine action after the attack on brize norton last week how be it that the irgc still sit un proscribe as the hon gentleman know we keep proscription under constant review and will not hesitate to take the most effective measure against the iranian regime he will know that we have already sanction the irgc in its entirety include individual commander but we do keep the matter under constant review praise the prime minister for his work on the new target and on ensure that we reach it for our national security and core defence do he agree that just as the labour government in the help to found nato this labour government could help found multilateral defence development bank that would ensure that we reach by the there be debate go on across ally as to how we can work together on the increase spending on the spend itself on the financial arrangement be that development bank or other arrangement and on ensure that we co ordinate our capability because the last thing we want be everybody spend more money in an unco ordinate way there have be intense discussion about that the situation in scotland be very difficult welcome the news that we be to go far with our at sea deterrent and of course the nuclear missile trident boat be base at faslane but as we have hear first minister john swinney and his snp administration do not back nuclear weapon far they have create hostile environment for defence firm in scotland because they will not back any firm that make ordnance this week we have also hear former first minister humza yousaf claim wrongly that allow our american ally to use the prestwick air base to refuel be some kind of war crime what can we do to nullify the threat to british security from these fifth columnist beat they this be not just the usual politic it be serious question of national security the at sea nuclear deterrent be house in scotland and just few month ago go and see one of the sub come back in it be very humbling experience quite frankly and get an even deep sense of what they do for our country it should be support in its own right and as an essential deterrent that matter be among the reason that we need change of government in scotland welcome the prime minister statement which show that international co operation and the ability to forge relationship of trust and human empathy be sign of strength not weakness our country be strong for his leadership and pursuit of peace globally through diplomatic mean do my right hon and learn friend agree that we can deter war and defend our ally such as ukraine only if outward look diplomacy be back up by ever strong armed force and an ever strong economy that those matter ought to unify all in the house and that it be very unfortunate that we have see petty party political game from the leader of the opposition agree all can say be that in fairness see on the face of some conservative members disquiet at the approach that the leader of the opposition take that be not surprising under the defence investment pledge resilience spending appear to include energy infrastructure give the evidence about chinese make cellular internet module and kill switch will he say categorically that china must be keep out of all critical infrastructure include wind turbine and solar panel the hon gentleman be right to raise the issue obviously we carefully review and monitor any chinese involvement in any element of security but it be right that we now include resilience in our overall definition of national spend and act accordingly thank the prime minister for his commitment to keep our country safe and for his effective diplomacy to that end while our international aid budget be now diminish it remain my belief that the work we do to prevent and respond to humanitarian crisis around the world play crucial role in global stability and security and in turn in our own can the prime minister reaffirm his commitment to that vital role for the uk in the world yes can my hon friend be right to raise the issue and describe it as she do we be leader on this and continue to be we want to get our aid budget back up but in the meantime want to work with other country to find other way of financing that support as matter of some urgency welcome the increase in defence spending but how on earth be the prime minister go to pay for it when his party can not agree on small reduction in the welfare bill when we go to we set out in clear term both the date and the way we would pay for it that be the way we do business on the government side of the house for year the conservative party lose control of the economy leave our armed force hollow out and leave billion black hole frankly they be in no position to lecture anyone about these issue still less after the response of the leader of the opposition which show exactly why the party be slide into irrelevance it be clear today that the leader of the opposition should never represent the united kingdom on the world stage it be absolutely outrageous be grateful to my right hon and learn friend for his statement follow the comment of other hon member may ask he what assessment he have make of the potential opportunity for scotland base defence and aerospace industry which already support hundred of job in coatbridge and bellshill arise from the expectation that spending will reach of gdp by do he share my concern that the snp disjoint defence policy risk job and investment in scotland we need to fight that at all cost my hon friend should not worry too much about the leader of the opposition represent our country she never will if she do presumably the chair at the nato summit would have little sticky note on it say busy at pmq that be how unserious her point be on the substantive question of job in scotland there be now the real potential to build on what scotland do it have proud history in relation to our defence and security this provide an opportunity to build on that platform thank the prime minister very much for his statement nobody in the house can doubt the sincerity of his careful word and commitment to what be good for the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland at the and nato summit the prime minister will be aware of my support for israel and that of so many in this great nation the situation be believe one of the major issue of the summit can the prime minister please outline whether time be take with our close ally the united states of america to discuss step that can be take to cut the head off the islamic revolutionary guard corps ensure that the usa bombing of the iranian nuclear programme be success and thereby secure truce and last peace in the middle east assure the hon gentleman that we have that discussion with our us ally both at leader level and between our team on an ongoing and constant basis israel have the right to be safe and secure and it be neither safe nor secure at the moment we have to be absolutely clear about that and about the right of israel to defend itself that mean discussion about the irgc and iran which have be constant source of threat terror and conflict in the region yes we discuss not just the attack on saturday but the further measure that can be take to ensure that iran never have the capability to develop nuclear weapon thank the prime minister for his statement and his leadership something that be sure be welcome by our ally around the world if not by the opposition my right hon and learn friend mention that there be now window of opportunity for peace in the middle east be sure that we would all want that to come to fruition however give the continuation of deadly attack on palestinian people seek food can the prime minister advise follow his discussion whether there be any prospect of israel allow the united nations and other humanitarian organisation to resume food distribution in an ordered and fair way they should do that and we be urge that they do the current arrangement be intolerable and be never go to work we need to be really clear about that we will continue to urge that with our ally and talk to leader across the region as my hon friend would expect but now be also the time to push on for the broad ceasefire to alleviate the situation more generally and allow path to open for the long term conflict resolution that be need it be the first duty of any government and prime minister to keep this country safe the prime minister take that role incredibly seriously in stark contrast to what we have see today from the leader of the opposition the prime minister have visit blackpool many time since become leader of our party at blackpool sixth form college young people tell he that they be cry out for local job in the blackpool area to keep they there will he ensure that the defence increase to which be welcome create the decent well pay job on the fylde coast so that young people in blackpool can get those job where they live be grateful for my hon friend question have visit blackpool many time as he know know first hand just how important it be for those young people to see money go into their economy with job in blackpool for they profoundly remember ask group of year old think at sixth form college in blackpool how many be proud to be from blackpool they all put their hand up when ask they how many think that their future job would be in blackpool only one put their hand up the rest all think they would have to leave blackpool to get the job they want we need to turn that around this give we an opportunity to start do that thank the prime minister for his statement today from personal point of view thank he for his recent visit to harlow and downs primary school which recently receive an excellent ofsted report do the prime minister agree that to achieve the sustainable and long term peace that we all so desperately want in the middle east in gaza in ukraine and in sudan we must work together with one voice and with all our nato ally that be why his leadership on global level be so important and why it be so important that he attend all these event to represent our proud nation my most recent visit to the primary school be to roll out our free school meal policy be happy to do that by serve school meal myself if all else fail ve get back up my hon friend be absolutely right at time like this the house usually come together and speak with one voice and we be the more powerful for it president zelensky have tell on number of occasion how much that mean for his people in fairness to the conservative party it have always be resolute on ukraine the leader of the opposition need to look again at her approach at time like this the soon we get back to the kind of cross party unity that we have the well our adversary know that when they see unity here that be much more of problem for they than when they see unserious division supply and appropriation main estimates no bill motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the bill be now read second time question agree to bill accordingly read second time question put forthwith that the bill be now read the third time question agree to bill accordingly read the third time and

country to contribute to our armed force the minister for veterans and people will set out further step as to how we will improve our reserve as we approach the armed force bill in the next session of

on the frontline overseas help to project uk power and influence help to stabilise region and help to ensure that we de escalate tension the work that our force do in the middle east may have be in the news quite lot recently but the work that they do that be often not cover in the news be just as vital for our national security and worthy of our praise and thank be sure that there be cross party support for the work that they do across the middle east the minister for defence procurement and industry will be in liverpool this weekend celebrate alongside her community of liverpool garston at armed forces day event the minister for veterans and people will be in coventry have complete tour of many of our community nationwide make the case for further investment in service to

the royal marines we will be out in force on the hoe on saturday for those people not familiar with plymouth geography and our international viewer the hoe have wonderful clifftop view of plymouth sound it be nothing more sinister than that as the son of royal navy submariner be proud to represent my home town which be not only steep in military history but play pivotal role in protect britain today have grow up as navy brat know that many remarkable people in defence tend to dismiss their achievement as just part of the humility that define service in our country but know what they do how they go well beyond the expectation of normal day job how they shoulder immense responsibility with great modesty and support by their family how they perform the ultimate public service through the government strategic defence review and defence reform we be put much more emphasis on our people and on renew the nation contract with those who serve the most troubling thing have see recently in relation to our people be the continuous attitude survey which reveal that only quarter of our service personnel believe that they be value by society encourage member who have not read the late continuous attitude survey to do so it tell the story of what our people think although we be now see morale stabilising after decade of it fall across all three service the fact that they do not feel value by society should be wake up call for all of we in think about how we talk about and support our armed force apologise for not be in the chamber when the minister refer to my constituency early this weekend we will host the national armed forces day event which will be fantastic he mention remember our veteran and our people and saturday will be true celebration of all the work that so many people put into make sure that we be safe and secure every day thank my hon friend for all the work that she put into make the case for cleethorpes to host the first of the renew national day event know that my right hon friend the secretary of state be look forward to attend event in cleethorpes this weekend and to hear not only from those people who serve today but the young people of the cadet in her community who may be those who serve in the future and the veteran who have serve our nation be look forward to event in plymouth but know that the event in cleethorpes will be the centre of our national attention this weekend and rightly so do the minister recognise that the uk armed force be visible manifestation of the philosophy and value that underpin the country if society do not value the armed force would he concede that it might be because we have consistently fail to defend the principle and value that underpin our society we should confront the accusation for example that this be an inherently racist country which it absolutely be not and that our history be not something to be proud of perhaps then wide society would appreciate the man and woman who defend not just the physical country but our value our history and our philosophy share the right hon gentleman passion for tell our nation story to tell our full story we have to explain the good bit and sometimes the bad bit but at all time we can look at the bravery courage and service of our armed force as source of national pride also look at our armed force today as the embodiment of some of our british value believe in equality it be very important to personally when think about our soldier operate in estonia at the moment ready to deter russian move across the border the colour of their skin their religion where they come from or their accent do not matter all that matter be that in that unit everyone have each other back and be proud of our country proud of their service and proud of the reason they be there armed force week be an opportunity to remind people of the difficult job we ask our people to do and to thank they for it the right hon gentleman be right to talk about the value that stand behind the uniform and why the flag they carry on their arm matter so much it be not just piece of cloth it represent british value that we should all be proud of for that reason it be important that we recognise that our service personnel need to feel more value the figure have plummet over the past year we know that word will not address the problem only action will and that be why it be so important to award our service personnel their big pay rise for more than two decade and to follow that up with another above inflation pay rise this year it be source of great pride to as the minister for the armed forces that for the first time we can say that every single person in uniform be now pay the living wage that should always have be the case but sadly it be not it be now our armed force deserve lot more than just decent salary the cold damp and mouldy home that many have be live in be betrayal of their service after buy back home from the private sector that be sell off under previous conservative government and save taxpayer more than day in rent payment we be deliver generational renewal of military accommodation with at least billion of funding in this parliament to tackle the poor state of force housing take this opportunity to mark an important week for our armed force welcome everything my hon friend say about support for our armed force and their family by way of investment in their home and more money in their pocket do he agree that support our armed force go way beyond just the equipment that they need on the frontline it be about make sure that their family be value through the support that the government can give they and that they receive from the community they live in could not agree with my hon friend more that be so important be somewhat guilty of this myself but many of our defence debate have be about kit platform and if have anything to do with it frigate we talk about the equipment but we need to talk about our people at the heart of the strategic defence review and the government policy be talk more about the family of those who serve that be why hope that the armed forces commissioner bill will become law soon it put an emphasis on allow service family to access the commissioner to make the case that it be the whole defence family those who serve in uniform and their family member who back they in their service that need to be value by this nation believe that view be share on cross party basis and we now need to ensure that it be feature in our legislation and in the day to day operation of our military there be more to do on that on the selling off of military home and the buying back of they by the labour government will the minister acknowledge that the negotiation for that deal start in may under the conservative government and be complete by the labour government indeed and when the announcement be officially make recall stand at the dispatch box and thank the shadow secretary of state for defence who be not here today for his work on it it be terrible privatisation truly awful it represent the bad value for taxpayer and it have doom many of our force family to appal accommodation for far too long now that that privatisation have end and we have bring those home back into public control we can invest in they we need to do that at pace because people be live today in accommodation with mould and damp that be not good enough we need to proceed at pace and the minister for veterans and people who lead on this work in the mod be as impatient as be to see the improvement as know the hon gentleman will be as someone who represent military constituency for the record the shadow defence secretary be not here because he have very important personal family commitment today be honour to stand in for he have the minister see our proposal for ringfenced armed force housing association to provide well quality accommodation for armed force personnel and their family be sure the house will agree that the right hon gentleman be by no mean poor substitute for the shadow defence secretary we plan to publish our defence housing strategy later this year which no doubt be not at all in the mind of the shadow front bench team when they publish their proposal ahead of time encourage the right hon gentleman to wait for the full work to be publish in due course but improve defence housing have to be priority because for many year as nation we have not deliver what our force deserve that will now change this year we extend the ability to reclaim the cost of wraparound childcare to many of those deploy overseas and next year we will go far and cover all overseas area to help make family life little easy we be legislate for an armed forces commissioner an independent voice to help improve service life we make manifesto commitment to bring the armed force covenant fully into law promise make by the nation that those who defend it will be treat fairly and will not be disadvantage because of their service that include for example ensure that service child have the same access to education as other child we be transform recruitment and hope that many young people will be inspire to join up after attend armed forces day event this weekend we be also overhaul access to care and support for veteran through the valour programme turn to veteran because although armed forces day be an opportunity to thank those people in uniform we should also use it as an opportunity to thank those people who have serve very much welcome the work be do to bring the covenant into wide and legislative effect with consequence where it be not apply that will be important in deliver service to our armed force right across the public sector but there be financial consequence parliament and government need to seriously consider how that financial consequence be bear and distribute to ensure that those public service be empower and finance to support armed force personnel and just as importantly their wide family in the good way they can agree with the hon gentleman it be important that the pledge be make in action and deed not just word if we look at the implementation of the armed force covenant across the country at the moment some area be exceptional and have embrace not just the word of the covenant but the spirit behind it and other be perhaps little far behind on the journey when we look at central government compare with local government there be distinction between the service and the offer that be why we be put it fully into law hope that one thing we will be able to do in have debate on put the covenant fully into law be to share the good practice we see in local council up and down the country in this place there be sometimes temptation to believe that all good idea must come from the dispatch box certainly do not believe that when can see brilliant councillor of all party make the case for improve the life of veteran those people who serve and perhaps most importantly their family where the covenant grip most successfully be where we can improve provision for child who may suffer disadvantage because their parent who serve move around so frequently which mean they sometimes do not get the same access to educational support special educational need and disability support and other aspect when that debate happen it will probably be later this year or the beginning of next year hope that all hon member will be able to participate and take something from that debate to amplify the work of their local council probably each and every member in this place will have something good to share about the work be do in their area we owe substantial debt of gratitude to all those who have serve their country the government have an endure duty to recognise their extraordinary contribution and to support they after service the majority of veteran go on to have successful career and life we be help they to make the good use of the diverse skill and experience that they have gain for example through the career transition partnership and op ascend but minority do not find the transition easy and may need extra support we be create new million network of valour recognise support centre across the uk to give veteran easy access to essential care and help just today we launch the valour pilot in the north west region at the imperial war museum north we have announce million to recognise the historic wrong experience by lgbt veteran in the armed force which be significantly above the level recommend in the etherton review we have also commit additional funding to maintain veteran homelessness support programme ensure that those at risk of homelessness have continue access to specialist help appreciate that the government be work on this issue but could the minister update we on the work be do to waive visa fee for family and dependant of our commonwealth service personnel the hon member will know that the ministry of defence recently publish write ministerial statement on how we can improve recruitment from the commonwealth it be not just about how we expand the pipeline come into our armed force we also need to recognise and support those who might be at the end of their service to get the support they need we have manifesto commitment to deliver that the defence secretary have speak to the home secretary about this and our official be in dialogue about it hope that the minister for veterans and people who look after this area will be able to announce progress in due course the hon member and share strong sense that there be wrong to be right here and those people who serve our country for good period of time should be able to settle here think progress will be make but recognise his interest in that happen the magnificent ve day commemoration as well as the equally historic anniversary of vj day in august have be widely acknowledge as perhaps the last major opportunity to thank those who fight in the second world war but we be also slowly lose the generation who do national service after the war and with they the live bridge they provide to our armed force we need to reconnect society with our armed force and widen participation in national resilience this weekend festivity be great way to kick start that process but as our strategic defence review make clear we have to be much more proactive as country about rebuild those connection particularly with young people half of the army current crop of regimental sergeant major be once cadet so we will boost the cadet force by by create opportunity for more young people to be cadet we will introduce voluntary gap year scheme for school and college leaver and develop new uk strategic reserve by fitting objective consider that yesterday be reserves day when we be able to thank the many thousand of reservist who serve this country they greatly bolster our capability at time of crisis serve across defence from the back office to the frontline they give we the skill scale and ability to meet the threat we face at home and overseas in cost effective way as the minister for veterans and people can attest after serve alongside they on various tour have see personally the enormous benefit that experience with our armed force can offer people particularly young people purpose adventure social mobility and unique sense of camaraderie and self achievement for many people it be route to much well life we want to make many more young people aware of the opportunity on offer and the chance to see where service life can take they as note early we be take decisive action to address the recruitment crisis that we inherit the tortuously slow process that cause so much frustration be be transform for example we have eliminate more than outdated medical recruitment policy and we be slash the time it take to access medical record from week to hour our objective be to reduce the time of flight from application to start at training establishment the new policy introduce by the secretary of state which mean applicant will get decision on provisional application within day and start date within day be good step towards improve this process but we know there be much more to do army recruitment have be completely restructure and we have act to keep hold of value staff who be most at risk of leave for example by introduce retention payment for army private lance corporal and aircraft engineer the result speak for themselves year on year inflow of recruit be up by and outflow be down by the royal navy have exceed its yearly recruitment target and royal air force application be up by third compare with early application to join the army be at their high level for seven year as we be discuss the armed service recruitment problem do my hon friend agree it be very helpful that this government be able to deliver an above inflation pay rise of for service personnel recognise their extraordinary professionalism in combination with last year headline award that represent cumulative pay award of since july which can only help with the issue he be discuss it absolutely do the strategic defence review talk about whole of society approach and view that from both an inside and an outside perspective as society we need to value our armed force more recognise that we all have role in build resilience and improve how our nation be defend but we must also recognise that armed force personnel need to feel more value by the whole of society ensure that our people be pay well and live in decent home be the foundation of that and hope that one day this house will not need to debate the quality of our military accommodation because the quality will be such that when we ask our people to move around the country whether into single living accommodation or service family accommodation it be simply give that it be decent that be our objective but we have lot of work still to do hope that member across the house will join our armed force and our community this weekend to celebrate the work of our service personnel as we set about reconnecte the nation to its military we must remember that service and sacrifice be not value confine to the history book they be just as important today as they have ever be and they be just as visible if we tell their story those value be embody in britain armed force there have never be more important time to thank they for the fantastic work they do or to promote the benefit of an armed force career to young people to all who serve all who have serve and all their family we give our deep thank to those who might serve in the future we say come along to an event this weekend and find out what our brilliant armed force could do for you rise order be conscious that some member arrive after the start of the debate ordinarily that would preclude they from speak but understand that the prime minister statement have slightly throw our timing my intention be therefore to accommodate all those in the chamber who wish to speak but inevitably those who arrive late will have to take their turn call the shadow minister give the topic be genuinely honour to open this debate on behalf of his majesty loyal opposition on the subject of armed forces day have the honour to be present in new palace yard on monday to watch member of the armed force raise the armed force flag in parliament in ceremony preside over by mr speaker and his chaplain the canon mark birch mvo it be joyous occasion and be pleased to say it be very well attend by many mp my opposite number the armed forces minister be the proud son of submariner and be the equally proud son of stoker first class reginald francois who serve on the minesweeper hms bressay on day we be both naval brat as he put it at least after fashion it be now establish that armed forces day be hold on the last saturday of june this saturday there will be many ceremony across the length and breadth of the united kingdom include in my county of essex and hope to attend the celebration in basildon the town in which grow up this be time when people across our four nation come together to celebrate the role of the whole armed force family regular reserve veteran cadet and of course their love one in defend our country and our democratic way of life will say something about those four category regular reserve cadet and veteran in my remark this afternoon begin with reserve armed forces day and indeed armed forces week normally enjoy bipartisan perhaps should say tripartisan support in parliament touch on this allow to say something about the value of the reserve to our armed force in do so declare an interest have serve as an infantry officer in the battalion the royal anglian regiment in the territorial army in the during the cold war when this date the berlin wall be still up greatly appreciate the extremely important role that our reserve in the royal naval reserve the army reserve the royal auxiliary air force the raf volunteer reserve and other play in support our regular in the defence of the realm in that context recently see an analysis show that follow the general election there be now conservative mp who have serve or be serve in either the regular or reserve armed force of the crown however the conservatives have no monopoly on military service as the same survey rightly show that labour have mp in similar position and the liberal democrats have eight for completeness should add that the hon member for strangford jim shannon also serve in the territorial army so he be with we on that point sometimes feel that he be always with we he be virtually omnipresent in the chamber it be therefore true to say that the armed force enjoy support across the political spectrum at least from those of we who be here merely note in pass that yet again when defence be be discuss in this chamber there be no reform mp present to grace our proceeding it be ironic and tell that member of party that like to wrap itself in the flag flag it do not own can not be bother to turn up to debate the service of those who loyally serve under that flag bluntly reform do not do defence nevertheless hope that most of what say in the next few minute will be broadly consensual with perhaps one exception which will come to near the end the role of our armed force in defend our way of life down the century be just as pertinent today as it have ever be with the war in ukraine where brave ukrainians continue to resist vladimir putin barbaric and illegal invasion of their country alongside the continue turmoil in the middle east on the regular those who serve in our armed force deserve our unstinting and ongoing support numerous study show that the vast majority of people who serve in the armed force benefit greatly from the experience as well as serve their country they often learn valuable skill and trade that make they highly marketable in the civilian job market indeed that can be problem for retention as the minister intimate when serve as defence minister albeit over decade ago one powerful statistic be that of those who leave the armed force find job within six month and believe the figure be equally good if not well today people who be smart discipline and train to turn up on time and to be resourceful be always likely to be attractive to employer veteran play an important role in my glastonbury and somerton constituency where of household include at least one veteran however female veteran be more than less likely to be employ than male veteran do the right hon gentleman agree that we must put more support into help female veteran find the right employment after their service agree we should do everything we can to help all veteran whatever their gender to find good employment after their service and that certainly include female veteran forgive mr deputy speaker but as it be take place in the hon lady constituency why on earth be kneecap be allow to appear at the glastonbury festival why on earth have the organiser allow that to take place interruption move on we need to bear in mind that without on point of order mr deputy speaker if may just correct the right hon gentleman the glastonbury festival site be not in my constituency that be not point of order for the chair but think it be helpful to have the record correct thank you mr deputy speaker we need to bear employability very much in mind as without skilled regular personnel to maintain and operate even the most expensive and sophisticated kit from typhoon and fighter to type destroyer and main battle tank we can not achieve operational success in short without well train people the equipment count for nothing and do not have the deterrent effect that we seek when ask at the royal united services institute early this week about the single big challenge that the royal navy face the fleet commander vice admiral andrew burns reply it people right now it the quantity of people and it not just recruitment it retention for context this be not uniquely british problem all our five eyes partner face similar challenge even the united states and shall return to that in moment let turn to cadet we in this country be fortunate to have an active and enthusiastic cadet movement and while we welcome the proposal in the white paper to expand the cadet even far we would like to see more detail about how exactly that will be achieve cadet unit play vital role in foster discipline teamwork and sense of service among young people provide invaluable opportunity for personal development and serve as pathway to career in the armed force should the young person desire that whether we be minister shadow ministers or otherwise we be all ultimately constituency mp so pay tribute to the army cadet detachment in rayleigh and wickford which be part of company in the essex army cadet force both of which have visit hope to see the rayleigh detachment again shortly not least as it appear that it will need to find new home within the next several year also highlight the valuable work undertake by wickford squadron of the air training corps and their sister unit rayleigh squadron air training corps declare an interest in the latter as recently have the honour of be appoint honorary squadron president its motto be amanogawa which be japanese for heavenly river and can confirm that they be in full flow over the year have hear number of hon member pay full tribute in the chamber to their cadet unit will chance my arm and say that be sure we will rightly hear praise for more cadet unit before the debate be out they be fundamental part of the armed force family thank not only the young people who sign up but those adult who give of their time voluntarily to provide instruction and leadership for these outstanding young people let turn to veteran as one example of work that can be do to protect veteran commend to the house an initiative know as the forcer protocol the idea be name after alan forcer who serve in the british army for number of year in several theatre but who sadly take his own life after struggle with complex post traumatic stress disorder his widow claire lilly come to see at my constituency surgery number of year ago and tell that she be determined to channel her grief in positive way by establish system to help find and protect veteran who go miss when meet claire be strike by her absolute determination to succeed and be pleased to tell the house that that be exactly what she do in short the forcer protocol be now standard operating procedure for many police force it be similar in some way to the herbert protocol for people who go miss with dementia but it have special feature that be design specifically to assist former service personnel in essence it work like this people who have veteran in their family who they believe may be vulnerable can register their detail confidentially include known associate and favourite haunt with an organisation know as safe and found online in the event that veteran go missing the family by release pin code can make that information immediately available to the police to assist they in their search for the potentially vulnerable veteran the initiative be trialle by greater manchester police over six month the trial be an outstanding success gmp report that it have allow they to make positive and timely intervention that undoubtedly save the life of dozen of veteran in the greater manchester area as result of that highly successful trial the forcer protocol be be roll out across police force nationwide we have an event to encourage progress in the commons in november and be pleased to tell the house that at very short notice the new minister for veterans and people attend to give his personal support for which thank he again today in an equally bipartisan spirit pay tribute to the actor and tv celebrity mr ross kemp aka grant mitchell for his unwavering support for that initiative for the work that he have do for veteran more widely and for his amazing documentary with the royal anglian regiment my old regiment in afghanistan thank you ross for everything you do for our armed force past and present we know your heart be absolutely in it and we be grateful be delighted to report that my constabulary in essex be formally adopt the forcer protocol today at ceremony at colchester it be deliberately do so in armed forces week thirteen force include essex be now use that life save procedure it be estimate that since the initial trial with gmp and the roll out across other force in this country the process have save literally hundred of veteran commend claire lilly for everything that she and her loyal band of supporter have do to make this possible we have another event in the commons this november by which time very much hope that all police force in england and wales will be fully sign up well do claire alan would be proud of you as mention early despite the tri partisan nature of this debate there be be afraid one issue on which feel that the government and the opposition will not agree the government propose treatment of northern ireland veteran more than regular british soldier serve in northern ireland during the trouble between and that highly challenging task know as operation banner be one of the long run continual exercise in the history of the british army during that long and at time highly dangerous deployment more than british soldier be kill assist the ulster defence regiment and the then royal ulster constabulary gc now the police service of northern ireland in uphold the rule of law in northern ireland many thousand of soldier be maim for life by both republican and so call loyalist bomb while try to hold the line in an incredibly complex and dangerous situation have see many memorial in my time but perhaps one of the most poignant be the royal ulster constabulary memorial at its headquarters in knock on which be commemorate hundred of officer who give their life work alongside the army to attempt to uphold the rule of law in northern ireland imagine the utter dismay of those veteran who serve in the british army in that highly complex theatre at the news that the labour government intend to drive through remedial order under the auspex of the human rights act effectively to remove key provision in the conservative inspire northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act that will have two very important effect first it will reopen the endless cycle of investigation and reinvestigation often via coronial inquest to which many british army soldier have already be subject secondly wonder whether many labour member be aware of this that same remedial order which their whip will urge they to vote for later this autumn will make it easy for gerry adams and his associate to sue the british government and ultimately the british taxpayer this be two tier justice at its absolute bad the veteran have initiate parliamentary petition protect northern ireland veterans from prosecutions which amass more than signature in well under month as of noon today the petition have achieve more than signature and it be still go strong as result of that public support we will debate that counter productive policy which be loom disaster for armed force recruitment and retention in parliament next month we conservative members vigorously resist that wholly misguided remedial order which be design to aid gerry adams while throw our brave veteran to the wolf we warmly welcome the daily mail campaign launch this morning to defend our veteran as the daily mail editorial powerfully put it this morning it be profoundly unfair that frail ex servicemen will continue to live in dread of knock on the door by the authority while ira murderer sleep easily with letter of immunity hand to they by tony blair think that put it rather well it be worth record that many of the soldier who serve in northern ireland be recruit from what we might now call red wall town from blackburn to bury and from bolton to burnley they be then order across the irish sea to help uphold the rule of law many of those survive veteran be now in their or even their and suspect that many labour mp would find it extremely difficult to explain to they and their loved one that they be take this action just because their government be literally obsess with the human rights act conservative members will bitterly oppose the remedial order labour members will need to look into their conscience and hopefully when the division bell ring do the same with that important exception hope that hon member from across the house who be in the chamber can agree that we value immensely the work of the whole armed force family and everything that they do to keep our country safe without those people who have the courage to take the king shilling as the old phrase have it put on uniform and if ultimately necessary risk their life to keep this country free we would have no guarantee of our precious democracy perhaps the most fitting way to end my humble contribution will be to quote the word of rudyard kipling from his famous poem recessional which be write in to commemorate queen victoria diamond jubilee those who know the poem will know that there be no hint of jingoism about it indeed quite the reverse it warn about the power of divine judgment and the humility of king as kipling put it the tumult and the shouting die the captain and the king depart still stand thine ancient sacrifice an humble and contrite heart lord god of hosts be with we yet lest we forget lest we forget thank the shadow minister the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois for share with we those powerful word by kipling which have sink into our national consciousness appreciate the cordial nature of the debate between the minister for the armed forces and the shadow minister we three be together early this week for debate on recruitment in the north east which be also incredibly cordial this be great opportunity to continue that conversation in stockton we celebrate armed forces day early on saturday with flag raise ceremony many celebration on the high street and service lead by paul be pleased to see representative of our local armed force member of the yorkshire regiment which largely serve my constituency be there although people in the north of my constituency might tend to join the rifles and we have representative from our local cadet force include the royal marines cadets the sea cadets and the royal air force air cadets who be base in norton in my constituency there be also representative from the royal military police reserves who be proud to say be also base in norton stockton have strong representation from the armed force in our local community be pleased to say that one in people in my constituency be either serve in the armed force or veteran mention the royal military police wonder if they be not mention enough in the house so think this would be good opportunity to commend their work they can claim to be the long establish regiment or corps with history stretch all the way back to the century and the appointment of the first sergeant of the peace today they be vital part of our armed force with around soldier and civilian staff they support operation in conflict zone keeping mission and humanitarian effort this be perhaps suitable moment to pay tribute to the hon and gallant member for epsom and ewell helen maguire for her service as captain in the royal military police and for her continued advocacy for the armed force community the royal military police be much like other skilled unit in the armed force but they have three main role the policing of the army special investigation and close protection in police the army they will be attach to unit in the field and will ensure that capture member of enemy force be treat appropriately legally and humanely which be clearly an important role they be recently deploy in ukraine as close protection for staff of the foreign office there be airborne rmp base in colchester they be part of operation market garden at pegasus bridge welcome what the hon gentleman be say would he accept that the action of the royal military police attach to fighting unit be direct reflection of the army and of our national character in uphold the rule of law even in warfare would may go on to develop this point but that role create for member of the royal military police unique duty and serious responsibility that put they in slightly different position from their comrade which must be quite difficult that be why want to highlight the role of the rmp member of the rmp can also find themselves in incredibly dangerous situation friend of mine who be member of the rmp reserve highlight to the role of royal military police officer during the second world war and in other conflict in manage traffic point those fix grid reference point be vital in manage the traffic flow of equipment and personnel appropriately for our logistic but they also mean that rmp personnel be easy to target by artillery and aircraft they carry out that role with great bravery commend they for that as have mention police put individual in difficult and unique position that be also true for the civilian police force but think there be particular additional burden on member of the royal military police in how they discharge their duty be strike by the story of royal military police veteran kate green which she tell year after the lifting of the lgbt military ban when she serve in the royal military police the thing that she fear most be be ask to investigate those suspect of hide their sexuality from the army if an lgbt serviceperson admit their sexuality they be out and that be the end of their military career eventually kate decide that she could not continue with her service anymore and that she do not want to continue to live lie herself so she hand in her one year notice the lgbt ban be lift on january just short time after her career end kate now work with the royal british legion and maintain strong connection with the army despite no long serve this be an opportunity for we all to welcome the lifting of the lgbt ban and to recognise the service of lgbt veteran nearly year ago when be at the university of exeter argue vociferously to make sure that our armed force be allow to recruit from our campus and that they get people like we into the military so that we could create military that be receptive and reflective of our society so that people from community could serve alongside we without any impediment do my hon friend agree that inclusion come from be part of an institution and help to change it from within and that it be necessary that we do not put in place impediment to armed force recruitment on campus today thank my hon and gallant friend for his service and his continued advocacy in this place for the armed force he speak powerfully and agree with he it be no small task to change the culture in an organisation it start and end with leadership so we must thank the leader in our armed force who have do exactly as he say will share the story of rachel webster she be royal military police veteran from the north east and she be another example of how it be possible to break down barrier and overcome some really quite entrenched stereotype rachel choose engineer over cookery when she be at school that be her interest but she be tell that she would not be able to weld because she be girl do not know if any hon member have ever have go at welding but have be boy and be terrible at it rachel be unable to pursue weld at school but like she leave school and join british steel it be well at teach her weld than it be at teach because she take four year apprenticeship programme and learn how to weld but her ambition be to enter the armed force she wish to join the royal engineers where many of her compatriot on the british steel apprentice scheme go but when she apply she be tell that woman could not be in the royal engineers at that time undeterred rachel join the royal military police in she train with the women royal army corps and then with the rmp and she be deploy to germany her career take she across the world from northern ireland during the trouble to afghanistan in but one of her proud moment come in iraq in she be help to build girl school and impress the local man who do not realise it be possible for woman to weld so she be able to use her welding skill on behalf of the army both rachel and kate have really powerful story they show we that courage do not know any gender or sexuality and hope that their story will inspire my constituent in stockton billingham and norton and people across the country let take this moment to very much thank all our armed force particularly the royal military police and its reservist in my constituency across the north east and across the country for their valuable service to our nation call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be an absolute privilege to speak in today debate on armed forces day day on which we recognise and celebrate the bravery dedication and sacrifice of those who serve and have serve in our armed force we honour and thank they early this week be proud to attend the armed force flag raise ceremony in epsom such event be hold in community across the country and their meaning run deep they be visible reminder of something that should never be take for grant the courage of the man and woman who step up to defend our freedom often at great personal cost this week be personal for because serve in the british army as part of the royal military police who vital operational work be quite rightly highlight by the hon member for stockton north chris mcdonald my journey begin with the desire to lead travel and make difference join sandhurst which be gruelle and inspire in equal measure as one of the few woman there at the time train in boot that be not design for but emerge with unbreakable friendship forge in resilience be first deploy to bosnia as part of nato peacekeeping mission later serve in iraq with princess of wales royal regiment during operation telic help to retrain the iraqi police force in dangerous and volatile area we operate under constant threat year before my arrival six of my royal military police colleague be kill in majar al kabir still remember the fear of that first night in maysan travel in black out bus and unsure of what lie ahead the fear of the unknown and of not make it home be one that many serve personnel still face today we carry out our mission with professionalism and camaraderie british troop work shoulder to shoulder with brave interpreter local ally and international partner but see at first hand how overstretched and under equip our troop often be compare with our ally we get on with the job but we should not have to make do armed forces day be not just about parade and flypast it mark time for action our service personnel deserve more than warm word they deserve fair deal that be why be call for fair deal commission to overhaul the condition face service personnel veteran and their family from housing to pay and from diversity to transition support our service personnel deserve reform unfortunately too many military family still live in substandard accommodation too many veteran struggle with poor mental health and inadequate support and too many veteran be still wait for proper justice and compensation we be pleased to see the government accept the etherton report recommendation but speed be of the essence because many of those affect be elderly or seriously ill woman in the armed force still face unacceptable level of harassment and misogyny as the atherton report reveal we must do well and we will push for full implementation of those recommendation when it come to troop number the reality be stark our armed force be overstretch and under resource we be call for new bonus scheme to help to bring into and keep more new recruit in the british army and the expansion of the current rejoin scheme to attract former soldier to re enlist leave the army early than plan like many servicewoman be force to choose between motherhood and military service there be no support no nursery and no flexible career path those be the real barrier that drive people out of uniform and the military lose many experienced people we must change that if we want to recruit and retain the good we need to support family the liberal democrats would create one stop shop for military family to access housing education healthcare and career support be proud of my constituency military history langley vale be once world war one training camp for more than soldier and it be now place of reflection our local royal engineers the geographic squadron recently celebrate year of proud service march with bayonet fix through ewell in this volatile and uncertain time let we honour the legacy of our service personnel not just in ceremony but in policy let we make armed forces day starting point for serious change it be great privilege to speak today to mark armed forces day moment for our country to show its deep and endure gratitude to all the man and woman who serve and have serve in our armed force their service underpin our national security our value and our way of life whether it be on the frontline or behind the scene at home or abroad those individual commit themselves fully to something far great than themselves and they do so not for recognition but out of duty since become the member of parliament for mansfield have have the opportunity to meet veteran serve personnel and their family have see at first hand the strength of character discipline and resilience that military life build it be clear that those who serve bring with they skill that enrich every part of our society once they return to civilian life but we must be honest about the reality that many of they face after service by its very nature military life be unique it often mean frequent move long separation from family and sudden transition although the vast majority of veteran make successful move into civilian life there be still far too many who encounter disadvantage whether in housing employment access to healthcare or mental health service and so forth serve for year at time for almost year at stretch have month on month off deployment where be away from my family during this armed forces week we must remember give praise to and celebrate our armed force family who as my hon friend describe suffer unseen pressure and burden thank my hon friend for his intervention certainly when speak to the family of serve personnel in mansfield that subject be always very close to the top of the conversation it be very important to recognise those issue and it be for those reason that it be so important that we recognise the armed force covenant our collective promise across government society and public service that those who serve should not be disadvantage by virtue of their service that be not just principle it be important that it be recognise in law but the covenant can be effective only if those in position of responsibility understand it and implement it properly that be why early this month on june be proud to host the first ever all party parliamentary reception for the armed force covenant here in parliament that event be hold in partnership with the royal british legion and the ministry of defence covenant team who do outstanding work to support veteran and promote awareness formally put on record in this house my thank to the royal british legion and to the minister for veterans and people for his attendance at that event its aim be really simple to help member of the house and their staff member well understand how the covenant operate and the support it provide and how we can use it to serve our constituent more effectively find it very encouraging to see member from across the house and across the political spectrum in attendance absolutely unite in their belief that no one who serve this country should face barrier when their service come to an end armed forces day and armed forces week be not just about parade and flag raise important though those thing be they be really about recognise and reaffirm our commitment to the people who defend our freedom day after day as we rightly thank our armed force today let we recommit ourselves in this house to ensure that their support be match by our support that their sacrifice be never meet with silence and that their family be never leave behind let we move forward on this day not just with gratitude but with purpose it be an honour to speak today ahead of armed forces day day not just of pageantry as the hon member for mansfield steve yemm say but of principle congratulate the government on reinstate the pageantry as well it be good thing it be day to recognise the man and woman who serve or who have serve in his majesty armed force the quiet professional who carry the weight of our security often in silence and too often without thank as we have hear we owe they and their family debt of gratitude that we can never really pay but gratitude alone be not enough as the minister say only quarter of veteran feel that their service be properly recognise and there be reason for that will speak plainly about it and hope the minister will not take it as partisan hope he will take what have to say in what will be difficult five minute of listen for he as call for action and assistance or if he like call for help as my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois say there be shadow that hang over our armed force the political and legal vendetta target the veteran of operation banner in northern ireland those man answer their country call in one of our country dark hour without hesitation they stand between the innocent and the terrorist often literally they be often in the way of the bullet now decade later they be treat not as hero but as suspect the frankly inadequately inform inquest into the sas ira conflict at clonoe be just one incident in which elderly veteran be be persecute there will be many more we should never forget that terrorist kill british soldier during the trouble the people who carry out those murder have effectively be exonerate by the british state do not blame the state for that it be necessary at the time but today we witness legal crusade against the man who risk everything in the service of peace this be not justice it be an attempt to rewrite history it be prosecution drive by politic not fact while the killer walk free authority hound the soldier who stop they from kill and treat those soldier like criminal the legacy act forgive my shorthand be design to put an end to this travesty for their own reason the government have decide to repeal that act but if they do not properly replace it with effective legislation they will hand the initiative back to those who spend decade glorify violence hope the minister will pay attention to every detail of the paragraph have just speak because it be important the government must decide whose side they be on in this exercise our veteran who be now in their or even old deserve peace in retirement not knock on the door and question about battle they fight to defend the public half lifetime ago those battle be fight under order under supervision and under yellow card rule and immediately afterwards everybody face close judicial examination of their behaviour to ensure they have obey the law in every respect to refer back to the speech make by the hon member for stockton north chris mcdonald the military police be often involve in those investigation it do not always make they popular but it be necessary part of the process not one of the condition have describe apply to the psychopathic murderer those soldier be up against have repeatedly ask the government to end this shameful campaign of retrospective injustice and will continue to ask until get meaningful answer and resolution to this run sore of injustice that be why support the petition that my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford refer to with its signature an astonishing number in such short time however this be just the start this issue be not just massively important to our veteran if this rewrite of history succeed this weapon of lawfare can be use against soldier in any future conflict destroy the effectiveness of our troop in future operation this morning edition of the daily mail carry powerful headline announce the start of campaign to highlight that very problem when we look at that headline though we should remember that this be not just about our special force it be about the whole of the armed force there be at least inquest into action by government agency and force that could potentially be restart by the government after the end of the legacy legislation only minority of those inquest be about special force most be about conventional force or about the royal ulster constabulary or the ulster defence regiment if we continue down this path not only will we betray our past we will jeopardise our future this campaign of persecution send chilling message to the next generation serve your country risk your life and face prosecution in your old age why would any young man or woman sign up for that the truth be that many will not know that the minister refer to well recruitment and retention figure but that will not last if this battle be lose by the british state this challenge have be most high profile when it have strike at our elite unit such as the special air service the special boat service and the special reconnaissance regiment the det as it be once know but it apply to every rifleman soldier and member of the military who carry and wield weapon in defence of his country those soldier who operate in condition of extreme danger and uncertainty be require to make impossible decision at great speed while under fire or in terror of be under fire they expect neither recognition nor reward but just one thing the support of their government we expect our soldier to put their life on the line for our country but why would they do that if their country will abandon they after their service instead they face doubt doubt that creep into the field into the command and into mission planning if soldier must weigh every trigger pull against future court case we cripple their ability to act what be the point of the armed force if we render they useless through legal ambiguity be the last person to tolerate unnecessary killing or misbehaviour by our troop those who be in the house at the time will know of my past campaign on torture and rendition will not stand for that but we must balance properly the rule of law as it apply to each environment we already have think through rule of lawfare establish in the geneva convention and that be where we must look first when conduct war from to during the operation against al qaeda in iraq our military achieve along with the americans spectacular result in save life reiterate that that be about save life in baghdad the number of vehicle bear suicide bombing fall from month to just one after we engage sectarian assassination once rife all but cease care of our military that be not the work of indiscriminate bombing or division level assault it be achieve through precise control and surgical raid into some of the most hostile environment generally by elite force and back by careful planning the impact be staggering even hostile panorama programme show that of terrorist neutralisation be capture not kill that be under unbelievable circumstance and thousand of innocent life be save that be matter not just of operational skill but of moral discipline in the midst of close quarter combat against some of the most dangerous man on earth our force show restraint few could match have no doubt that mistake be make from time to time and those should be answer for but if we allow our opponent to use lawfare to destroy these capability we be leave with blunt instrument the bomb the missile and the drone with which instead of capture or kill just the guilty we kill every innocent civilian on bus or every guest at wedding party our military have be brilliant at do the opposite at be target lawful and effective dismantle that capacity would be not only militarily reckless but betrayal of the principle that the minister say we stand for which distinguish we from those whom we fight let we today do rather more than clap politely at parade let we act let we end the relentless hounding of our veteran let we give our serve force the legal protection and political support they deserve let we recognise that if we find it difficult to recruit it be consequence of state that too often turn its back on its defender this armed forces day let we make one promise that no british soldier will ever again be abandon by the very nation they have so bravely protect rise to pay tribute to our armed force personnel may associate myself with the minister remark start by recognise veteran for their past service and their contribution to society they continue to serve society with their skill and leadership shape by their unique military experience also thank our reservist for the extra

funding particularly around general training mean that there be not enough money to progress training level sincerely hope that the government will look at way to provide more support on that be also former employee of the royal british legion and as someone with experience campaign to improve the life of our armed force strongly welcome this government commitment to renew the nation contract with those who serve and those who have serve have work on raise awareness about the armed force covenant be pleased that this labour government recognise its importance in support our armed force

help to upskill our vital defence sector and our armed force community look forward to join in armed forces day celebration this saturday want to speak in the debate today to recognise the contribution of all those who serve in our armed force and those who stand beside they in support it be armed forces week and will be attend the huntington armed forces day on saturday at sapley play field pass on my appreciation to anna dutton for her effort in organise the day from standing start also thank andy phipps of cambridgeshire army cadet force for his effort for region with strong link to the armed force it be wonderful that our armed force personnel and family both british and american will have the opportunity to participate locally say that as an mp who be very proud to have military basis in his constituency whether they be british with raf wyton the home of uk defence intelligence or raf molesworth and raf alconbury which be both run by the us air force we have an extraordinary number of us personnel in and around our village which always take people by surprise when they hear those american accent armed forces day be about the recognition and celebration of those young man and woman who give up the good year of their life to serve their nation in uniform it be also about those who stand behind they who sacrifice their time their career and their ability to make home in order to support their partner mother and father to realise their career ambition spend the good part of decade in the army although rarely if ever mention it it be one of the great experience of my life particularly now that through the passage of time have all but forget how bad some of it actually be but do love it and do miss it the camaraderie the experience and the opportunity be all unique element that make be part of the armed force so special you forge bond with those who serve alongside you and the unspoken share experience allow you to meet fellow veteran and bond over share love of spin dit sadly it would be inappropriate in this place to recount most of those dit if not all serve in the armed force during the high tempo of kinetic operation since the korean war it place strain on our armed force the like of which we have not see since know that those on the labour benches often like to recall that the last time we spend of gdp on defence be under the last labour government and the pm even mention it in his statement early today what they do not often mention be that that operational tempo just about break the army echo the word of the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire in my experience of serve during the same period we go through kit and equipment very quickly with the pace of change that we currently see on operation and in warfare we would do well to remember know the minister be listen that we cycle through different type of body armour in four year period think we have three different type of body armour and three different type of helmet we change our entire camouflage pattern and we have to bring in urgent operational request to have vehicle that could withstand roadside bomb we go from patrol in beret and enhance combat body armour in iraq to patrol in helmet and with metal detector in afghanistan only couple of year later the pace of change be something that we must consider hesitate to interrupt what be marvellous speech and great testament to the hon gentleman service but he mention the urgent request for vehicle that could withstand roadside bomb think this might be an appropriate moment to mention that in response to that new type of steel be develop in the uk ballistic steel which be invent at the university of cambridge develop at our steel research institute and produce in south wales that be great national response and it demonstrate the importance of not only our steel industry but our industry in general in provide rapid response to the requirement of those in the field concur although do not know anything about the detail of that steel and the armour it provide it be worth bear in mind the pace of change and our ability to react we have hear lot of talk in recent week about the capability that we intend to buy but we have to remember the old adage which be so true no plan ever survive first contact with the enemy that be probably truer now than it have be for many year we take our armed force for grant although the jingoistic applause the veteran discount and the thank you for your service be not for we it be too gauche we be after all british the flip side be that there be certainly some middle ground to be occupy we need great societal recognition of the value of serve and an inculcation that service to one nation be something to be proud of something to aspire to and something that benefit not just the country but the individual we too often look to our armed force as default civil emergency force and the first port of call if there be flooding we ask they to deliver sandbag if it be snow we ask they to clear the runway at heathrow if firefighter go on strike we ask our armed force to man the fire truck we also ask they to provide security at the olympics even the bin strike see the army bring in to help although appreciate that there be specific process by which the help of the armed force be enlist wince whenever see it activate we should not need to rely upon force of barely or so available service personnel to cover everything they should not be the default bailout for government or local government ineffectiveness our armed force deserve well they deserve to be pay properly so that they do not have to take pay cut when they be deploy on operation as be recently explain to by some of the personnel on nato operation in poland to be house properly so that defence contractor do not paint over the mould on the wall because treat it be not on the contractor checklist as have be inform be happen in service family accommodation in my constituency at the moment to be post sympathetically so that family do not end up split apart if both parent be serve personnel as have see happen to my good friend who be still serve and to be support and grant stability so that service personnel child can receive stable home and education could go on but the point be make be that the treatment of our service personnel be not good enough frankly it be not good enough when serve it be not good enough under the last government and do not think it be good enough now while do not doubt the government sentiment retain little confidence that the situation will drastically improve despite the promise we in this house often stand in this chamber and wax lyrical about our armed force recount story of their bravery courage commitment and sacrifice but they be more than just backdrop for an announcement and encourage those of we in this house to remember that will make one light hearted final point as we members of parliament return to our constituency this weekend to participate dutifully on saturday and attend the event and parade spare thought for those young man and woman as much as be sure that they value and appreciate the recognition remember this well from my own army experience the irony be that the good way we could show how much we value they be by not make they work on sunny saturday afternoon in june it be with immense pride that rise today in armed forces week particularly as the national celebration be return to cleethorpes this weekend that will be moment of real honour for our community in great grimsby and cleethorpes nearly year after the last time we host such an event in and my have lot happen in those year to have it return under labour government be an incredibly proud moment my constituency may not have garrison town such as those that my colleague represent but our tie to the military run deep and proud from american gi camp in grimsby people park during the second world war to the brave man and woman who give everything to their country to support the war effort include our town fisherman as well as my great grandma may and my great aunt kathleen who

constituency have two amazing squadron base in waltham forest and leyton and the good air cadet squadron in the country behind they be corps of volunteer who really do not get the recognition they deserve and it be really important that we recognise the people who prop up these organisation in our community will my hon friend join in recognise their service and commitment my hon friend make an important point member have say today that we will not have future pipeline of young people who want to participate in the armed force who already have the training and the discipline and who understand the lifestyle if we do not have the adult who be prepared to give up their time to support that it be incredibly time consume and take they away from their family and it really do show

together and in july face the horror of the somme together as part of the brigade in the division they stand shoulder to shoulder with battalion from edinburgh as they launch the first wave of the british assault at am the chums advance into what would become day of unimaginable loss some manage to reach the german trench include second lieutenant harold hendin who with just five man reach the enemy reserve trench and hold out under relentless counter attack of the battalion fall that officer and from other rank with only two officer return uninjured and barely man leave stand their bravery and sacrifice be an endure legacy of our community contribution to peace and freedom our loss be not just from that time over the last two decade we have have number of other loss from our community such as flight lieutenant smith marine lance corporal ford trooper pearson guardsman major and sergeant telford who should also be recognise in that vein welcome the commitment from the government that show their determination to improve the life and welfare of military serve personnel and their family and particularly the force accommodation improvement have live in service accommodation can confirm the difference that it make to have good quality home the property of some of my friend be not in such good state they be bring up child but be have to keep on top of some pretty terrible structural issue while their partner or husband be away on service also acknowledge the additional fund for homeless veteran which will be invaluable for ex servicemen and woman who become homeless after struggle to adjust and make change later in their life and who perhaps feel that their community be not as strong as it be when they be in the force make sure that we have the precision funding to support they be incredibly important this weekend as the red arrows fly over cleethorpes beach hopefully can share an ice cream with the secretary of state or perhaps pint there will be lot of pint drunk this weekend as our community celebrate with parade and display of remembrance we will feel fierce pride in our past and present and sense of unwavere support for our armed service know that speak for everybody in great grimsby and cleethorpes when say thank you to those who serve who serve now and who be prepare to serve their bravery and sacrifice be write into the soul of our nation and into the street home and family of our community let we honour they not just on saturday but through the value we champion the support we offer and the remembrance we preserve for generation to come call the snp spokesperson there be many gallant member in this chamber in the scottish parliament chamber back home in scotland and in other legislature of these island both national and local member who have serve in the armed force with distinction and bravery pay tribute to they and to those family and many friend who have serve and in some case continue to serve hold they in the high regard for their commitment to protect the freedom that we hold dear that commitment be demonstrate by every rank and in every location where our armed force operate scotland have very proud and distinguished military history armed forces day have become further focal point of community support for our serve armed force and our veteran in my constituency of moray west nairn and strathspey there be around serve personnel around at raf lossiemouth and around army personnel between engineers at kinloss and the battalion royal regiment of scotland the black watch base at fort george they be support by hundred of ministry of defence civilian and military contractor such as boeing and bae systems who jointly with our serve personnel deliver significant defensive and offensive capability for our military system in addition there be around veteran in my constituency believe we have the high percentage of any constituency in the uk that reflect the north of scotland very long and distinguish connection with the military once we add in immediate family around one in five people live in moray west nairn and strathspey have direct military connection quite some figure it be unsurprising therefore that the armed force in the area be not view as separate or distinct community but rather as significant and integrated part of the wide community as be often the case in the north of scotland there be no fanfare but rather an everyday respect and appreciation of the role of the armed force embed in community life frankly it be something that just be that be important there be no we and they we be whole community that do not of course equate to the armed force be ignore as can be readily observe from the significant number that turn out year on year across the constituency to witness act of remembrance be very pleased that those number have grow over the last year very significantly and show no sign of drop off there be military child in most school in the constituency and some school have very significant percentage of military child military charity be well support in the region include ssafa the raf benevolent fund help for heroes and erskine veterans charity which fairly recently open very welcoming and well attend facility in forres that be provide fantastic support to veteran they can get together for chat or for the more extensive support that erskine can provide the military include contractor offer fantastic range of opportunity to young people in the region and many take up those opportunity in my pre parliamentary life spend some four year as leader of moray council during that period we strengthen our role in deliver the armed force covenant we work cross party and across the chamber in the council to do that that have continue with cross party support and the council achieve the gold standard in the employer recognition scheme during my time as council leader be very pleased to support the develop civic link between the council and hms spey royal navy river class offshore patrol vessel currently operate in the indo pacific give the constituency and the wide region really strong link with all three service will touch on some politic trust this will be take in the positive spirit in which present it this be not day for hard politic but there be some thing that could be well for our armed force first on the covenant mention this early to the minister very much welcome proposal to embed the covenant in legislation there will no doubt be challenge associate with that and financial implication but it be in my view the right thing to do look forward to future opportunity to debate embed the covenant in law secondly one thing that frustrate in my council day be comparatively rapid change in number notably at raf lossiemouth which happen with no financial support to the council many council with military basis particularly air force basis be in rural area with small population and consequently small budget to operate with that make they less agile because they simply do not have the money available at short notice to make the change require to deliver service at big scale other member will be certain have similar experience in area with significant change in military number if the mod be private developer it would be contribute substantial sum to support growth in childcare education and health provision and range of other public service it would also be require to invest in infrastructure such as improve road and junction in the area the current design of our armed force and the government departments that support they do not lend itself to do that this need serious work be by no mean fan of everything that the us do but in this regard when significant change occur to military relate population there there be government department that step up for period to support local authority include with finance to help smooth change with investment in service provision and the local economy council and health board have to absorb big bump in demand and that be frequently easy say than do we have welcome opportunity to fix that the department in the us be call the office of local defence community co operation it use to be know as the office of economic adjustment but think that perhaps sound bit orwellian would welcome further opportunity to debate this issue to see what progress can be achieve the team in the us describe its role as help community to navigate the impact of department of defence action and programme change that be exactly what we need to achieve in the uk and it be particularly important as we move into an era of significantly increase spend on our armed force and growth in our base number there will be demand for more dentist doctor teacher and wraparound childcare that put lot of pressure on local service and we need to navigate our way through that before conclude my contribution would like to make three specific mention first like number of member who have contribute to this debate be take part in the armed force parliamentary scheme in my case the raf course which have afford many excellent learn opportunity that enable as parliamentarian to well understand our armed force and to more effectively represent constituent with connection to our armed force pay tribute to the armed forces parliamentary trust which be behind

its personnel group such as the defence sikh network be do just that by raise the voice of sikhs in service and work to ensure that they can serve with dignity and authenticity in the defence sikh

sikh principle of protect those more vulnerable than they the introduction of these gutke help serve sikhs to maintain the connection between their faith and their duty it be not always like that what come to mind be the story of young oxford graduate hardit singh malik in he be deny entry into the british royal flying corps he be go to join the french until his tutor intervene and get he special dispensation he fly with great distinction he fight against the red baron and come back survive for mile at low altitude with two bullet in his leg his plane be shoot at more than time as he himself

ilford in world war two we honour those whose name be not always remember whose record be lose like those of the man of the raf photographic reconnaissance unit and we reaffirm our commitment to implement real change from large scale policy initiative to small cultural initiative we must make our force strong and more inclusive rather fittingly this debate come in the shadow of the nato summit at the hague yesterday with its headline pledge for defence spending to reach of gdp by the midpoint of the next decade echo remark from across the house about how we live in an increasingly volatile world perhaps more volatile and more unpredictable than at any other point in the era of pax europaea and pax americana we see the bloody conflict on european soil since the second world war and death and devastation in the middle east and across africa asia and beyond in comfort on civvy street we be perhaps sometimes guilty of forget how fragile our freedom and democracy be and we forget the threat pose to they our value be not guarantee they have to be fight for and we must be remind of that we live in an age that be the historical exception not the norm our way of life at home depend on our strength to defend it and how we project ourselves abroad we recently celebrate the anniversary of victory in europe just few generation back still within the memory of many this country be engage in fight for its very life and survival we would do well to remember that always thankfully the brave man and woman who serve today need no such reminder come from military family my late father serve in the royal naval reserve two of my three brother have have long career in his majesty armed force ben be brigadier in what still insist on call the black watch as officer command in scotland when the late queen die he be in charge of make sure that everything go smoothly can not tell you how proud be of my baby brother ben when it do johnny now retire be lieutenant colonel in the grenadier guards they have dedicate their life to the service of our country assure everybody that their example and that of every soldier sailor and airperson reinforce my knowledge that our military remain in the good of hand say perhaps with shred of bias that britain armed force be still the fine in the world speak with additional pride about my constituency of tiverton and minehead which be home to veteran it be proud part of the country with strong military tradition take this opportunity to salute the fantastic presence of the royal british legion and other veteran organisation in my patch particularly the wonderful dunkirk memorial house at the foot of the quantock hill and the armed force breakfast club in minehead and bishops lydeard which provide sense of community have do lot of pro bono work with the royal british legion in previous life particularly on ptsd and hear loss this be topic very close to my heart be delighted to hear the minister announce that the armed force covenant will be include in legislation it be national obligation to look after those who have serve we before be elect have to try and help young raf veteran owein and his family include his young daughter autumn who have just be diagnose with autism they have become homeless if only that legislation have be in place then know that my colleague councillor claudette harrower who be responsible for the covenant at mid devon district council will endeavour to make sure that the very good have be do the armed force covenant be not charity it be justice we must be alive to the recruitment crisis currently bedevil our armed force we must close that gap fear however that we be not overly help ourselves in this regard allow to draw attention to the plight of young constituent of mine which suspect be frustratingly similar story to that of number of young people up and down the country in february she give up the chance to study level to attend the lichfield assessment centre where in october she pass the assessment with score that be exemplary and such that she be accept into the intelligence corps however by june of this year some month later she still have not be give start date and just receive occasional hold communication from military authority meanwhile she get by with series of menial part time job but have seemingly be leave in the lurch by her army recruiter be not use her name because she have ask not to but will give the minister her detail later in the hope that we can process this matter soon rather than later young people like my constituent who be prepared to serve their country and so represent the good of their generation deserve well will the minister comment on that privately will the minister also commit to publish detailed target for processing application allocate sufficient personnel to the recruitment pipeline and provide all successful candidate with concrete start date within reasonable time period want to put on the record that the veterans minister be know as legend when he serve in the royal marines and to he remain legend can send he an email and receive his response within hour which be enormously helpful to my constituent who be the people serve in finish refer to aleksandr solzhenitsyn who say that he be patriot but not nationalist as finish my speech reiterate his word speak as proud patriot but never ever nationalist it be both pleasure and privilege to close today excellent debate on armed forces day pay tribute to colleague across the house for their thoughtful and passionate contribution rise on behalf of his majesty loyal opposition to express our sincere thank to all those who serve and have serve in our armed force regular reservist veteran and cadet and to the family

you thank you to those defend the uk and our interest around the world our armed force represent the very good of our country committed courageous and professional they work tirelessly often in the most challenging condition to keep we safe and uphold the value that we share today debate have be particularly powerful because of the personal reflection share by so many right hon and hon member the hon member for stockton north chris mcdonald represent strong military constituency one in serf or have serve in the military have watch the hon gentleman in defence debate it be clear to that he be passionate advocate for his constituency with strong military link he talk about the royal military police regiment that play vital role that we need to hear more about enjoy hear about the airborne police officer unit an interesting skillset that we could potentially see in the met he also talk powerfully about his constituent kate and rachel veteran who face internal adversity because of their gender and sexuality as he say rightly courage do not know any gender or sexuality the hon member for mansfield steve yemm talk strongly about the skill that military people bring to civilian life have see many veteran in my constituency make that transition know how many skill they bring he advocate for more support for they to make that transition and mention the real need for the armed force covenant to be strengthen be glad to hear about the reception he hold here recently in support of the covenant and it would be good to support he in future such endeavour we must ensure that the sacrifice make by our service personnel be never meet with silence as he say but with real lasting commitment and action agree with my right hon and gallant friend the member for goole and pocklington david davis that gratitude for service be not enough on its own only quarter of veteran believe that service be value and completely agree that that need to change he speak powerfully about northern ireland veteran especially the special air service regiment in which he serve he speak about the injustice that group of special force soldier and other in the military face from the opening up of domestic legal framework those veteran be in battle that be fight under order under the yellow card legal system and under the view of the royal military police there be strong legal framework surround those operation and my right hon friend make the point that those veteran join up and serve our country but the view be now that they can be prosecute in later life that be not right and look forward to the issue be debate later this month and hope overturn the petition on the subject be currently live and there have be significant uptick in the number sign it in the last few hour the hon member for bolton north east kirith entwistle make remark about her personal connection to the armed force and her husband service in the reserve it be interesting to hear about the royal artillery regiment in her constituency and her link to the royal british legion she make powerful case for great support for training and look forward to the minister response to it also echo her support for expand the cadet programme spend many happy year in the air cadet and see what value they bring to society and as pathway for people to join the military align myself with her comment my hon and gallant friend the member for huntingdon ben obese jecty be as ever strong advocate and champion for the military unit in his constituency we regularly hear he call for more support he serve the uk in operation during the global war on terror in afghanistan and iraq and he know first hand the challenge that come from the evolution of war and the need for kit to keep pace with the evolution of threat as he rightly say no plan survive first contact with the enemy and those word remain as true today as they have ever be it be crucial that we not only learn the lesson of modern conflict but ensure that our armed force retain broad range of capability to meet the demand of the evolve environment that we may be involve with in the come year my hon friend also make the fair and timely observation that make our armed force work on hot saturday in late june be perhaps not the good way to honour they the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn rightly highlight the volunteer who work tirelessly behind the scene to ensure that our armed force be commemorate properly they often miss out on enjoy the event themselves so hope that they will find time to relax and enjoy some sunshine with their family we thank all of they and their grassroots group for their vital support for these commemoration she also share move story about her great aunt and mother which touch many of we in the chamber they welcome polish serviceman into their home and they become part of their family nearly year ago demonstrate how service personnel become deeply weave into our community and life as always be sure the red arrows will deliver magnificent display over cleethorpes this weekend hope that she manage to enjoy an ice cream and hopefully few beer too with the secretary of state when he be in her constituency this weekend the hon member for portsmouth north amanda martin be the proud mother of serve royal navy sailor olly whom she have speak about many time she represent city with high number of service personnel and veteran one of the high in the country and one of the home of the royal navy say that as devon mp and stand opposite the minister who represent devonport she also raise an interesting point around the protective service btec course have see the value of that at first hand in my constituency at bicton college and it be interesting to see young people flourish in that environment again just like the cadet it provide strong pathway for those who want to go into the military or other protective service the hon member for north devon ian roome again represent strong military veteran and of household he have long be proud advocate for the royal marines with the commando logistic regiment in his constituency be impressed to hear about the work he have do with ssafa the armed force charity it be enjoyable and interesting to go away with he recently on the trip he speak about to normandy to see the day commemoration it be particularly poignant to meet the day veteran norman ashford who be year old he be royal marine and as the hon member say make countless trip up and down on to the beach that day have great deal of respect for he when meet he and hear his story the hon member for ilford south jas athwal speak about the raf photographic unit tale of derring do it be unit that have enjoy learn about as the campaign have be grow and look forward to that debate be reschedule and bring back to the house he make some interesting point about the contribution of people from all over the world include the commonwealth to our armed force and the need to celebrate they this armed forces day it be interesting to hear about hardit malik the first indian fighter pilot in world war one with the royal flying corps fight against the famous german red baron lastly my near neighbour in the south west the hon member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour have strong military family and have speak to she many time about her brother service she raise an interesting and important point about the pathway for people who want to join the military she talk about her constituent try to join the intelligence corps and the wait time to join be far too long it would be interesting to discuss whether something can be do to provide concrete start date too speak from personal experience be proud to have serve in the royal marines and after leave regular service decade ago be fortunate to continue as royal marine reservist with the royal navy parachute display team it be to say the least one of the more unconventional side gig in public service give literal bird eye view of armed forces day celebration over several year have the privilege of parachuting into national armed forces day event in guildford cleethorpes and llandudno from thousand of foot above see the crowd gather to show their support be genuinely humble although will admit that at that height my primary concern be not so much national pride as avoid crash land into someone picnic those kind of event be not just pageantry as member from across the house have say today they be powerful tool for engagement and recruitment have vivid childhood memory of attend large air show and other military display but one personal favourite and one that be sure many hon member attend be the royal tournament at earl court here in london the navy high octane field gun competition and the royal signals famous white helmets motorcycle display team make lasting impression on and without doubt help shape my decision to join the military as defence spending rise and as difficult choice be make to support that increase it will be more important than ever to showcase our armed force and their capability that visibility ensure public understanding and accountability for where taxpayer money be spend there be also broad point as the national security strategy outline this week the threat we face be serious the possibility of hostile attack on the uk which for many decade be see as unimaginable be now again within the realm of possibility time may come when we must once more defend the thing that we hold dear we must therefore forge renew relationship with defence not see it just as line in the budget but recognise it as fundamental pillar of our national security and resilience armed forces day be about more than capability it be about morale it be about recognise the extraordinary service of our sailor soldier and aviator public support matter as it lift spirit strengthen bond and remind those in uniform that their country stand firmly behind they that support must go far than symbolic gesture as we have hear repeatedly in today debate the armed force covenant be solemn pledge year round commitment from government business and community to treat those who serve and their family with fairness and respect in everyday life the message from today debate be clear gratitude must be back up by action on housing employment and dignified transition to civilian life these be responsibility we all share the government strategic defence review rightly propose whole of society approach to national defence it be welcome and it be necessary defence be not just the task of our armed force it be share civic responsibility true resilience rely not only on military capability but on strong institution cohesive community and national unity at the heart of that resilience be trust social contract between the nation and those who serve it we must do all we can to honour that trust which be why we can not ignore the serious concern raise by veteran especially those who serve in northern ireland the strength of feeling in that community be real and justified my right hon friend the member for goole and pocklington mention that in his speech place on record my thank to the minister for veterans and people the hon member for birmingham selly oak al carns for his principled support for judicial review of the clonoe inquest and hope his judgment be actively be seek by his colleague in the northern ireland office especially as they reflect on their plan to repeal the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act our veteran deserve clarity compassion and fairness the strength of the royal navy the british army and the royal air force lie not just in firepower or training but in the character of those who serve their dedication discipline and selflessness be credit to our country so let we use this armed forces week not only to reflect but to renew our commitment to serve those who serve we to honour those who have wear the uniform and to ensure that future generation understand the debt we owe we be grateful we be proud we will remember they we will support they and we will thank they member who have to sit through my opening remark will be pleased to know that will not be repeat many of they but be keen to pick up on number of point raise in their speech which be so ably summarise by the hon member for exmouth and exeter east david reed thank hon member for their contribution at time when it be easy to take political pot shot across the chamber on serious issue today debate have show that we can come together cross party to support our people to have serious debate about the contribution our armed force make to our national security and to raise genuine issue of concern with respect and thoughtfulness sadly not as many people will be watch this debate as watch other proceeding in the chamber but if do they would see parliament work effectively and properly in bipartisan spirit perhaps the minister will allow to relay brief apology promise the chair of the defence committee that would explain why he and some of the committee be not here when ordinarily they would be they be on an overseas trip directly relate to defence business it would help keep honest if the minister allow to place that on the record the right hon gentleman certainly do not want to offend the chair of the defence committee so be glad that he have have the chance to put that on the record what hear in the debate and what hope our force will have hear if they be listen be not only support for the man and woman who serve and advocacy for the armed force as brilliant career choice but support for improvement to the transition from military life to civilian role and support for those who have serve in the past we hear story of heroism and courage that make for good debate and be pleased that number of member be able to pick out element from the strategic defence review the government have adopt all recommendation from lord george robertson report and we will implement they in full further announcement will be make about what we be implement and how we be take forward not only the sdr recommendation but its spirit as we set path for increase defence spending to of gdp by april to in the next parliament and to by and for spend on resilience and homeland defence over in the same period hope there will be plenty of opportunity for member to make the case that increase defence spending can mean spend not just on kit and equipment but on our people expect that to be hear loud and clear across the house so that when we hear conversation about renew military accommodation we know that there be an increase budget to pay for that work and when we talk about value our people we know there be above inflation pay rise for they for the first time in very long time that be important there be one thing that will expect to see and hear more about in future debate we hear lot of mention of our army navy and air force and their traditional role but in future debate on the armed force expect that we will hear more mention of those who work in cyber and the digital defence of our nation the cyber direct entry pathway that we have open have be success and we look forward to announce the passing out of the first cohort later this year the ability for we the armed force and people who care about defence to talk about cyber resilience and protect our digital infrastructure be just as important as protect against kinetic and more traditional military threat indeed expect that in future year there will be more discussion of how we keep our space domain safe be glad that number of hon member be able to talk about their role and participation in the armed force parliamentary scheme be the minister responsible for that and be proud of the way that the scheme have be expand in the past year thank the armed forces parliamentary trust for its support on that the scheme be superb opportunity for parliamentarian who have not serve and for those who have to experience different perspective on military life it allow they to understand what we ask of our people to listen and learn from they their deployment and their experience and to bring that into the house and improve our work here turn to comment make in the debate be glad that the shadow minister the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois talk about the forcer protocol indeed expect all member of the house to ask their chief constable whether their police force be go with that undertake to do the same for devon and cornwall police as will many of the other devon mps imagine there be real merit in the protocol so be grateful to the right hon gentleman for bring it to the house attention be proud to be plymouth first ever out mp and see the way that lgbt personnel and veteran be now speak about in the house fill with pride when be grow up there be not always the role model or the public debate that enable folk like to feel that there be place in the armed force for they the remark make by my hon friend the member for stockton north chris mcdonald and other be very powerful he say that courage know no gender or sexuality which be absolutely right we need to build that sentiment into our armed force as we seek to change the culture so that everyone be welcome and there be no place for abuse as we move to warfighting readiness we need the contribution of people from every background to our armed force if we be to keep our nation safe be grateful to the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire for talk about the importance of payment to lgbt veteran the priority order be establish by the minister for veterans and people the initial payment have go to those over and those who be sadly towards the end of their life so that we can ensure that those payment be make before they leave this place we have now establish the procedure for pay the large cohort of people who do not fit into that category and the minister for veterans and people will make further announcement about how we will roll out the payment we be pleased that the first payment have be make in full to the first cohort agree with the hon member for epsom and ewell that armed forces day be starting point for serious change believe that change start on july last year but take her comment in the spirit in which she make they it be not enough to talk about change we have to take action hopefully she and member from across the house will see the strategic defence review be implement the increase in defence spending the increase pay for our force and the housing improvement all of which will contribute to improvement be grateful to my hon friend the member for mansfield steve yemm who speak about the armed force covenant be our collective promise which be exactly right as we look to put that fully into law there will need to be conversation if may be cheeky madam deputy speaker point out to right hon and hon member of all party that question on our armed force covenant need not be direct only to the ministry of defence if the covenant be to be effective we need every government department to understand their role in put the covenant fully into law the minister for veterans and people have be undertake cross government work on that and imagine that there will be further such work in due course as we build towards that legislation in the hope that other government departments be listen the minister might recall that say in my remark that at noon today the northern ireland veteran petition have just over signature look few second ago and the figure be now just shy of perhaps people be inspire by the excellent speech by my right hon friend the member for goole and pocklington david davis will the minister convey to his colleague in the northern ireland office that we do not want to throw our northern ireland veteran to the wolf and clearly from this petition neither do the public will return to the right hon gentleman speech so he will not have to wait long for my response but first will deal with some other point be grateful for the speech by my hon friend the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn about the national armed forces day event which be pleased to see back she have passion for the event and be serious about her community she also have pride in and close connection to the folk she mention it be very powerful speech be certain that the ice cream will be on the secretary of state especially now that he know he be go to the event so she should expect plenty of dairy come her way thank the hon member for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter who speak about raf lossiemouth the importance of how we base our people and value the wide community be grateful to he for mention hms spey the offshore patrol vessel be do superb job in the indo pacific as be her sister ship hms tamar their contribution to uphold the international rule base order and support our ally in the region be really important she be little ship with big impact and be really very powerful there so be grateful for his comment encourage the hon gentleman not to forget the opportunity to talk about resilience spending he talk about the spending of other government departments and council effectively enable homeland defence that be precisely why the spending pledge agree at the nato summit be that by of gdp should be spend on homeland defence and other activity that bolster our resilience as nation think he have strong case to argue on that nato will shortly publish the full criterion set out what money will come into that but believe that the example he give be good one to use in argue his case so encourage he to do that my hon friend the member for portsmouth north amanda martin and do indeed wave off hms prince of wales when she leave for her deployment to the indo pacific that be good opportunity to meet member of her community in portsmouth the carrier and the carrier strike group include people from all part of our country who be all sail together alongside many of our ally include our norwegian friend who have frigate sailing on the entire deployment when we celebrate the contribution of our armed force let we remember the contribution of our ally to keep we safe today and in the past be very grateful for the intervention from the hon member for horsham john milne who speak about jack dark birthday be also grateful for the remark from the hon member for north devon ian roome who speak about norman ashford day veteran it be really important that we value and take extra care of those final few folk from the second world war we must ensure that we capture their story and retell they so that they be not forget be grateful for the contribution of all of they my hon friend the member for ilford south jas athwal correctly raise the issue of the raf photographic reconnaissance aircraft can report that the minister for veterans have indeed meet those involve in the campaign as suspect nearly every single person in the house have if there be public affair award for good lobbying campaign this campaign would certainly deserve it understand that progress be be make and that the campaign group meet westminster city council to discuss the issue the cost of what be be suggest would need to be meet by public subscription and have no doubt that it would be so expect positive progress there be strong support for recognition of the bravery of the people who undertake these role in the second world war and be grateful to my hon friend for raise that issue be also grateful to he for give example of service personnel who in recollection of wartime story do not always get the attention that they deserve include those from the sikh community who he speak about it be good to have three front bench speaker from devon that do not always happen in this place be grateful to the hon member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour who speak about the contribution that her family make on the issue of the time of flight as it be refer to in the ministry of defence that be the time from sign up to attend training establishment we inherit situation in which that time be over year for some of our service and that be not acceptable in july last year we be lose of people in the process not because of medical problem or eligibility issue around nationality or criminal record but simply because the process take too long that be not acceptable be strongly against the criticism make that our young generation do not want to serve our nation because that be not true last year people try to join the british army and we hire at the end we lose the vast majority because the process be too long and slow that be why we be reduce the time of flight be very happy to look into the casework matter that the hon lady raise if she write to the and policy that mention in my opening remark should certainly make difference when roll out fully across all three service will certainly try to discourage the minister for veterans and people from read the transcript of this debate be regard as legend will no doubt boost his humbleness be also grateful to the hon member for exmouth and exeter east for his concluding remark and for his story of nearly crash land in someone picnic he do not tell the end of that story but as he be here in one piece let we assume that it all go well be also grateful for the way in which he summarise the debate my hon friend the member for bolton north east kirith entwistle raise valid question from battery about training level we have inherit situation in which training for both regular and reserve force be often the first casualty of try to manage in year budget pressure over number of year we be very aware of that within the ministry of defence we be conscious that the increase in defence spend could in part make difference to that but as we have number of challenge to deal with we need to look at the good way of deliver increase training particularly adventurous training which be what many of our force want would be very happy to have further conversation with my hon friend so that she can raise with the particular of those issue the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty between make his speech and come back have change his tie to look more like mine be very grateful for that fashion change his remark particularly about the contribution of the us air force basis in his constituency be good reminder of the close friendship we have be at the us embassy early today as part of conference organise by the council on geostrategy look at our transatlantic alliance our military to military co operation underscore the value of our relationship with our us friend and know that america really do value the basis in the uk that it be able to operate from entirely agree with the hon member for huntingdon that our armed force personnel should be pay properly house properly post sympathetically and grant stability that be the intent of many of the change we be make on the stability point be think in particular about where we be with british army deployment because air force and navy personnel generally have great stability than their compatriot in the army we be aware of that issue and be look at it but be certain that the hon member will be send lot of parliamentary question possibly before have even sit down let turn to the very serious issue raise by the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis who speak about northern ireland veteran he will know because we have speak about it number of time and he have also speak with the secretary of state and the minister for veterans that we on the government benches feel very strongly that we need to support our veteran we be seek to navigate through that process at the moment the debate on the petition mention by number of members will take place on july welcome that debate which will be an opportunity to make the case for those people who serve our nation in support of peace in northern ireland there be more work to be do in this area after the right hon gentleman make his speech read the article in the daily mail about the launch of the campaign that he reference it be certainly true that the government seek to repeal the current northern ireland legacy act but what one have to get to the penultimate paragraph of the article to read be that we intend to replace it as well the right hon gentleman choose his wording carefully about how that replacement need to work the current act be unlawful it have be find to be so in number of court and it have not prevent some of the thing we be see at the moment so we have to find way forward in this area the northern ireland office be look at it at the moment and we in the ministry of defence continue to have conversation with our nio colleague indeed think that be the point that the shadow minister the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford be make in his intervention and we will continue to do so come as do from constituency in the north east let say that member of our community of course serve in northern ireland for many year so the issue of northern ireland veteran be just as important to those of we on the government benches as it be across the whole house be in the house on may when the secretary of state for northern ireland say that the government come into office commit to remedy the failure of the legacy act that give great assurance to and be sure it give great assurance to veteran in my constituency do the minister agree with the secretary of state comment entirely agree there be something that be not right and it need to be resolve do not doubt the passion that opposition members and indeed those on the government benches feel about this issue share that passion we need to find solution to this issue that can provide peace of mind as well as the ability to address community concern there be path through but we need to go carefully to make sure that we be cognisant of all the strong view but be certain that will happen be also certain that we will continue our conversation outside the chamber as we work with northern ireland office colleague who have the lead in this policy space be grateful to the right hon member for goole and pocklington for raise the issue in this debate this have be good debate for armed forces day support come not just from the member who can speak in this debate be conscious that number of members present have be unable to speak due to the vagary of parliamentary procedure include my hon friend the member for motherwell wishaw and carluke pamela nash who sit behind as the parliamentary private secretary to the secretary of state she be attend armed forces day event at the motherwell united services club on saturday my hon friend the member for wellingborough and rushden gen kitchen be the whip on the government benches early and be conscious that there be whip on both side of the house who might not be able to contribute verbally but who be certain will be support armed forces day event in their constituency across the country we need to ensure that the warm word and well craft speech we have hear today be put into action all year round it be not enough to have day where we celebrate our armed force we need to recognise their service each and every day as the nation see an increasingly uncertain and dangerous world on their tv screen and on their phone it be the man and woman of our armed force who be at the pointy end of the defence of our nation but we can all do something to increase the resilience of our defence if everyone in the house update the operating system on their computer and phone britain would be more cyber secure than it be beforehand we all can do something in this place in particular members of parliament from all part of the house can continue to make the case for our people for defence family for investment for well pay and for well equipment for our force that be this government intent and from the sentiment have hear from all part of the house today we can see that have cross party support thank all hon and right hon member for their contribution and wish everyone successful armed forces day on saturday question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider armed forces day float solar panels motion make and question propose that this house do now jones be delighted to see the house so full for this adjournment debate want hon member who be stay to remember who be here indeed people in the public gallery might wish to make note in their diary too because hope that will in some way blow the house mind with what be about to say and sow seed that will grow into something fantastic what we be here to discuss be float solar member will know that be the member of parliament for spelthorne feel obliged to remind the house on regular occasion that spelthorne be not in lancashire or in lincolnshire it be everything south of heathrow until one get to the river thames hon member from around the house know my constituency well because it be what they see when they take off from or land at heathrow airport be select as the candidate for spelthorne four day into the general election campaign have spend year in the army obviously love map there be very good saying if you do understand what be go on get big map when look at map of spelthorne be strike by these four massive block of blue so look into they they be four raise reservoir which hold half of london drinking water be practical person first think to myself well there be not many vote there secondly think can not really build any house there spelthorne be green belt and water and large chunk of the rest of it be floodplain so it be difficult to know what we might do to meet our housing target people get cram into the small island where development can happen be determined though to find some way to utilise the acre of raise reservoir in my spelthorne constituency look into it little far and come upon the concept of float solar this be terribly simple concept simply take solar panel attach they to plastic float anchor those float to the bottom of the reservoir and stre some wire to take an alternating current from the float solar panel the clever bit in term of intellectual property be the anchor because as be sure hon member know the depth of reservoir tend to vary by about metre from time to time equally reservoir be drain and reassess on rolling cycle of about year thank my hon and gallant friend for allow to intervene we be tell that there be nothing new under the sun but he be describe something that tick both box it be quite remarkable learn much about reservoir from play by the side of the scenic penwhirn reservoir outside by home town of stranraer also learn about they in geography class at stranraer academy and it strike that one of the reason that reservoir level rise and fall be to do with evaporation and water be obviously precious resource do cover reservoir help to combat evaporation my hon friend pre empt one of the many benefit of float solar that will highlight to the house he remember his physics higher well because the placing of float solar reduce evaporation from the body that be cover by give that the vast majority of the water in our reservoir be lose through evaporation every year we will save great deal more water if the government decide to pursue this technology at grand scale part of my come here today be to speak to two large constituency within this house there be constituency that contain reservoir or man make water source similarly countless member from across the house have very difficult decision to make about put solar farm on good agricultural land essentially what have happen be that the whole discussion in this area have become zero sum game it be battle between food security and energy security and there have seem to be no way of unpick that until now globally float solar have be put to practical application at large scale in china india and vietnam the uk be formerly leader in this space because on the queen elizabeth ii reservoir in grand technology demonstrator be put on and plug in and it have be bang out mw into thames water water treatment facility ever since that be enough to power home give that float solar cover less than of that reservoir be sure that hon member can see the vast potential want to talk about some of the benefit of float solar because they be legion first as hon member will have work out already there be the removal of the opportunity cost of put float solar panel on grade agricultural land if we do not have to put they all over lincolnshire and we can put they on reservoir that land can be use for grow food my hon and gallant friend be talk about the use of prime agricultural land and food security be part of national security as be energy security and indeed water security however there be huge trend of prime agricultural land be devoted to solar plant include in my constituency of epping forest where new plan be about to go in for acre plot between thornwood and epping upland he be articulate alternative for the placing of solar panel and there be plenty of such place up and down the land brownfield site reservoir railway siding rooftop of agricultural building so do he agree that we must protect prime farmland and the green belt and make sure that solar panel go in the right place completely agree with my hon friend hope we be go to give hope across the house and therefore across the country that this alternative solution to put solar panel on grade agricultural land be to certain extent an answer to maiden prayer not only do float solar remove the opportunity cost of put it on agricultural land but one of its beauty be that it be twice as efficient as land base system land base system warm up because they be on the land and as they warm up they become less efficient whereas float solar panel because of the evaporative effect on the underside remain automatically cool and efficient throughout sunny day as the hon member for strangford jim shannon be not here unusually perhaps can fill in for he we have already hear from one of my essex colleague my hon friend the member for epping forest dr hudson about the controversy in essex over number of solar farm development on land before the boundary change have very large reservoir in my constituency at west hanningfield which would be ideal for the technology my hon and gallant friend be suggest do he not believe that many hundred of other reservoir across the country would be so suited do indeed be not sure which minister would respond to this debate so have have only the brief of moment to look at the lake in burgess park in the minister peckham constituency to see whether that may be suitable for float solar we have talk about the opportunity cost and about double efficiency be sure hon member will have work this out but the acre of reservoir in my spelthorne constituency be raise which mean no one can see the top of they unless they be fly off to torremolinos or landing from dubai therefore there would be none of the visual vandalism that people object to so much and the carpeting of our beautiful country in solar panel would go away too must declare that share an office with my hon and gallant friend so know an awful lot about float solar because he be so passionate about it as result would point out that grafham water in my huntingdon constituency be the eighth large reservoir in the country by volume and the third big by area it be also raise reservoir but ironically it be surround by solar panel to generate electricity that we can see from the ground he obviously agree with that it would be fantastic idea to use that enormous stretch of water for some float solar be grateful to my hon and gallant friend for join this merry band of evangelist for float solar and for seek to get in on the ground floor with the inclusion of the reservoir in his constituency within minute he be immediately see the opportunity and congratulate he on that be really happy to join this debate which be not only amusing but very educational for it be matter of great concern for this country to conserve the water supply we have do the hon member therefore agree with that float solar stop the evaporation of water because it avoid direct sunlight hit the water and that it also conserve water the hon member with whom serve on the defence committee make very important point about future proof the united kingdom water supply from increase temperature in australia understand that reservoir be be cover at great expense to reduce evaporation he might know that where float solar panel exist they reduce evaporation by in the case of the queen elizabeth ii reservoir that is tonne of water day it be absolutely extraordinary know member be think well lincoln it could get any well but have to tell the house that there be still some further benefit hon member more where reservoir be own by water company and the water company want to use the electricity themselves there be no requirement for planning permission when we consider the turmoil that land base system have to go through over many many year and the paroxysm the nation put itself through before it put in land base system we should note that float solar can be deploy within few week this be another issue where the conservatives can perhaps give more information to those on the government benches we have real issue in many part of rural britain with the energy infrastructure that have to go alongside solar farm for example the massive mega pylon in east anglia if the energy can be use onsite or if there be exist energy infrastructure as there often be around reservoir due to hydro and other factor that be another great reason why float solar be solution that everyone can get on board with my hon friend make fantastic point the queen mary reservoir in my constituency have plug in point to the national grid at one end of it the ability to minimise the disruption that be cause by place solar farm away from where the power be need be certainly consideration that play into this hon member will think well that must be his list complete those must be all the benefit of float solar because there can be any more but say to the house that one of the most astonishing thing about float solar be that it improve the water quality underneath as it be denude of light and heat there be thing that grow in the water which the water company subsequently have to filter out to make it tap ready for we and our constituent the water company have to use few filtrant where the surface have be cover by float solar we have cover the evaporative effect so think have make the case for float solar my hon friend make strong point about be able to use float solar to obviate the need for development on green belt land in other part of the country be he aware that development have be propose by bloor homes at dollymans farm in my constituency for up to house which be major issue in the ongoing by election in wickford park do he agree that to prevent the housing at dollymans farm people should vote for the excellent conservative candidate lewis hooper before the poll close tonight we have go from cooper to hooper be delighted to follow my right hon and gallant friend endorsement and wish everyone there the opportunity to get to the poll today to exercise their democratic right be very grateful to my hon and gallant friend for give way second time do wonder if may have stumble across another advantage to float solar which may not have occur to he if water quality be improve will that not help the fish clatteringshaw loch reservoir in my constituency have some of the good pike fishing in the country wonder if the fish might benefit from have roof over their head on tuesday visit the queen elizabeth ii reservoir which be closed site own by thames water be not aware that there be any fish there but there be certainly bird life it be important to make the point that the general planning norm and all the modelling have be base on cover only of these reservoir in order to leave sufficient space for leisure use include fishing no doubt and for bird life the bird see on the queen elizabeth ii on tuesday be warm themselves very happily on the float solar panel because of course by be on the panel they be predator free as nothing can attack they there how big could this be hear the house roar how big could this be thank my hon friend for that the instal base of every single solar panel in the united kingdom be produce gw if we be to cover of man make reservoir in this country we would double the national capacity add furth gw without touch an inch of agricultural land that be absolutely extraordinary in so do we would create job in the construction phase and job in the maintenance phase my plea to the minister who know be put the finishing touch to the government solar road map be that float solar should play much great part in the final road map than it do in the first draft be grateful to my right hon and hon friend for their support hope this debate have be educational and informative and that they be now fully sign up to the float solar brother and sisterhood which will go forth from this place and evangelise for the good cause thank the hon and gallant member for spelthorne lincoln jopp for secure debate on this important issue and for prosecute his case for float solar with such flourish also wish to put on the record that the minister for energy my hon friend the member for rutherglen michael shanks be desperate to be here and be very sorry that he can not be but be glad that be able to stand here in his place be also glad that the hon and gallant gentleman be able to make his speech today as know he be not able to intervene in the recent solar debate let start by say that absolutely agree the government be very clear that like the hon and gallant gentleman we believe there be an exciting role for float solar it be new technology but one that we think have huge potential developer around the world start to come forward with utility scale proposal in the past decade and several large project have be construct in recent year include installation with the capacity to generate hundred of megawatt of electricity which have mainly be in china the hon and gallant gentleman have very effectively set out the upside of float solar so will not reiterate they however want to put on the record that we agree and that we recognise many of those upside will say little about the state of float solar in the uk today there have be some deployment of float solar in the uk lightsource lead project on the queen elizabeth ii reservoir which be just outside the hon gentleman constituency as he mention the project use solar panel to generate around of the site electricity need it be at the time of construction europe large float solar installation there be now other small project across the country but the scale be still nascent and very limited we have already hear about grafham water which be large reservoir in my constituency just to the north of my constituency in north east cambridgeshire we be about to start build the fens reservoir which be as be sure the minister be aware joint project between cambridge water and anglian water it will be million cubic metre and the development consent order be expect to go in in with actual construction start in do the minister agree that this be fantastic opportunity to try out this nascent technology on large project which could generate so much energy in the cambridgeshire area thank the hon gentleman for his intervention there be many scheme and huge opportunity and the government be work with industry to think about what the potential be across the country new proposal be come forward and we be try to engage with they although we see that there be huge potential it be also important to put that in the context of some of the challenge we face as we try to grow float solar we be try to do our part to work with industry so we want to ensure that we deal with some of the obstacle and barrier to the scheme that be come forward for example planning or investment certainty float solar project can apply to the government flagship contract for difference scheme and they do know that one of the argument in favour of float solar which the hon and gallant gentleman put forward and which be reiterate by other hon member be that it will reduce the amount of land that we need to use argument have be make about agricultural land and constrain the amount of ground mount solar panel on they gently say however that if we look at the statistic we see that only of land in the uk be cover by ground mount solar at the moment minuscule amount even with the expansion that we be actively try to encourage we be still talk about fraction of uk land that will only ever be use for ground mount solar so it be important to put that in context the minister be right to point to the figure now but this be grow problem one of the difficulty with the land that go under solar panel be that it tend to be south face land which be prime agricultural land that be where the crop would normally go so this be grow problem recognise that point but even with the expansion we be still talk about only fraction of land inevitably regional and local government will make judgment about the land that we protect everyone recognise that we must have prime agricultural land because we need it so we be make decision and local government will also be make decision in that context just point out to the minister that she could save herself vast amount of political pain because apart from few swan that see couple of seagull and one man from the royal society for the protection of birds there ai many people who be go to complain about put float solar on raise reservoir be always in the market for less pain let say little bit about some of the constraint eligible bid have be submit to our contract for difference scheme but unfortunately none have yet be successful that be because the cost of float solar be about to high than those of ground mount project and the reason for that be the cost of the float structure on which the panel sit and we hear from the sector that these can account for nearly half of the cost of the project moreover float solar require expensive underwater cable which cost more than land base system therefore although we be very keen to encourage this technology and to encourage the sector to grow there be more that need to be do in order to make they cost effective from government perspective it be critical that every scheme and every project that we support be cost effective so that in the end taxpayer be not foot the bill for technology that be too expensive thank the minister for allow to intervene again she be make powerful argument for look again at the cfd scheme which be notoriously complicated and very difficult think we need two pronged approach we need some change to cfd but obviously technology associate with solar be move on all the time so perhaps the two could come together we will always keep this area under review we recognise the potential of the technology and we will continue to work with industry to bring down cost as the hon member say there be reservoir and waterway where there be potential problem but there be also the potential for it to be painless if we can help to unlock the technology there will absolutely be appetite from the government for this we be try to invest in research and development in this area and we be put in government support and investment to unlock that finally the hon and gallant gentleman mention the solar taskforce we be work at pace to deliver the taskforce recommendation the taskforce have effectively bring together industry and government to discuss the action need to scale up solar deployment in line with our clean power mission it have identify the need for road map to address the specific barrier to float solar and other innovative technology and sub group have be convene to focus on this specific topic wonder whether the taskforce have engage with the company that run the queen elizabeth solar farm it be call bluefield very clever name very clever company it write to the secretary of state early in the year some four month ago but be yet to receive reply would be grateful to know whether the department be engage with bluefield and whether could nudge the secretary of state to reply to its letter thank the hon and gallant gentleman for that his nudge have be take and will pass that on to the minister for energy as department we be try to engage extensively with industry on how we will take forward the complex and difficult challenge as we try to deliver our clean power mission if company and organisation can lend their insight and knowledge to help we develop well policy we be always in the market for that so will pass on the nudge we be finish the final touch to the solar road map and it be due to be publish very soon while will not disclose the detail of it assure hon member that the question of float solar will be address within it we recognise that float solar be an exciting area and we think it have huge potential for deployment in the uk we be see the technology be deploy more broadly in other country and we want to be part of that the hon and gallant gentleman have talk about the benefit for the grid water quality consumer of electricity and ultimately climate change there be much to like about float solar the challenge for we be to work with industry to ensure that we can unlock its potential that mean reduce the cost ensure that it be cost effective and ensure that we can deploy the technology the one commitment will make on behalf of the government be that we will always engage with industry as we do this work we want the innovation insight and experience of the bright and the good as we try to build up our clean power sector so we will work with industry to unlock the huge potential that we believe be there question put and agree to house adjourn
