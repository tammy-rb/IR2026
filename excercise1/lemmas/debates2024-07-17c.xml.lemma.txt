work that the right hon member and carry out throughout the last parliament be an example of how we can work co operatively with member of opposite party and find those issue on which we can serve our constituent well he join we at an opportune moment as be about to talk about an issue that be close to his heart my final urgent request of the government be one of moral duty to recognise support and compensate our nuclear testing veteran and their family these be the man who put their life at risk in dangerous atomic weapon test to ensure our long term security for decade campaigner labrats veteran and their family and the indefatigable susie boniface have be fight for recognition for these hero they have highlight scientific study that show increase rate of miscarriage increase birth defect and the same rate of genetic damage as clean up worker at chernobyl of course the campaigner take pride in the fact that the defence secretary and the prime minister meet they when labour be in opposition and support their campaign to receive the long overdue recognition they deserve but despite win the campaign for medallic recognition the uk sadly still remain the only nuclear power that refuse they adequate compensation research and support unlike the us france canada and australia medal criterion be very limited there have not be formal recognition event and even access to war pension have be impede veteran and sometimes their wife widow and descendant have report make repeat request to gain access to their blood or urine testing record from sample the veteran recall be take during the nuclear testing programme sadly many confirm that their service medical record frequently do not include the test result and they just do not understand why the data be vital for their war pension application and for understand the condition they suffer but sadly the absence of such record mean that many veteran war pension application be refuse want to place on record my thank to hon member right across the house who have continue to support these veteran particularly the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes who have work closely with and campaigner in recent year this week we have both write to the defence secretary and the minister for veterans and people my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak al carns request that they
