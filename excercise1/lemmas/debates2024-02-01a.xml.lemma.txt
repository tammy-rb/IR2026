pigmeat production and chicken do the secretary of state accept that this asymmetry on standard of animal welfare be incoherent and pose significant risk of contaminate the food chain with ban pesticide the hon gentleman be mix up two issue he mention australia and specifically egg if he actually look at the agreement with australia he would see that egg be exclude as be pork and poultry he

almost nothing for their milk their potato and the ordinary thing that man and woman buy in this country where be the money from these high price go because it be not to the farmer can tell the hon

what step he take be to support local authority to reduce litter and fly tipping in city what step his department be take to tackle fly tipping know what blight litter and fly tipping can be on local community which be why we have provide nearly million to help council purchase new bin and almost million to combat fly tipping while furth million will be award in the spring we have more than double the maximum fine that council can issue with all income from fly tip fine to be reinveste in enforcement and clean up our street from april to ensure that council can invest in crack down on crime

affairs minister to ensure that we can work together for the betterment of all peatlands be such an important habitat so it be important that we work together that be why we be put huge amount of money into restore peatland in the upland and the lowland and we have just increase our sustainable farming incentive payment for that farmer can get more than hectare to start to re wet peat call the shadow minister agree entirely with what the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton say we welcome the government intention on peatland but the idea that this government after year be so fizz with new idea that they do not quite have the parliamentary time to get on with act on those intention be candidly laughable will the minister tell we what be actually happen we be expect

damn indictment of the government record it say they be largely off track with just four of the target be achieve when it come to the environmental land management scheme can the minister tell the

stakeholder and farmer who be work up and down the country to improve the environment they have spend generation create that environment we should celebrate what they have achieve and we should encourage they to do more that be what the sustainable farming incentive be design to do and what the scheme be deliver the minister do know do he the government be spend large amount of public money

constituency environmentalist such as those at chester zoo be shock to see that the government have ignore the advice of their own expert and authorise the use of neonicotinoid pesticide for the fourth year in row will the minister tell how that be line with our national and international obligation to reduce the overall risk from pesticide and how it reduce our biodiversity loss the hon lady

globally hopefully emma hardy will get we back on track call the shadow minister recently meet with farmer henry ward who show the extensive and damaging flooding right across his farmland cause by two breach in the river after storm the environment agency be unable to tell he when it will have the resource to repair those breach this mean that henry not only lose all the crop that be flood but will be unable to plant new crop in spring he be not the only farmer to be impact when will the government realise that their failure to be decisive and get ahead of the problem of weak defence be cost farmer their livelihood and order we only get until to take advantage be just not fair we must have brief question from the front bench not only have the water minister the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend the member for keighley robbie moore be decisive he have meet the individual farmer the hon lady mention on his farm we be take action to

of rise inflation in the price of item such as bread milk and even baby formula may again ask the secretary of state to commit himself to implement food price control if further brexit red tape lead to the food price hike that be be anticipate such be the obsession with brexit in the snp that we hear no mention of the impact of the war in ukraine no mention of the farmer who be strike across the eu and no recognition of the huge amount of work on supply chain that be be do by my right hon friend the farming minister moreover the hon gentleman seem not to have notice the rapid review of label that we be conduct which be about empower consumer and ensure that the high animal welfare standard that we have in england be well reflect be sure the secretary of state have see report in that about third of the uk wheat crop have either rot in the ground because of the wet condition or be not drill at all supply of spring seed be very tight with many variety already sell out and while it be possible for some farmer to use farm save seed it be illegal for it to be trade between farm many farmer do not grow spring crop this year or indeed sell their crop at harvest be there solution to the

touch on we have also provide international leadership by put nature at the heart of tackle climate change at which be strongly reflect at the select committee have be consistently hold water company

flood alleviation scheme and our flood resilience be incredibly important which be why the government be recognise the amount of investment we need to put into it we be double that investment from billion to billion over the next six year period the sort of scheme we be help will assist project across the country to deal with those problem do my right hon friend recognise that drift net fishing for bass be more sustainable targeted and efficient than fish with set net will he reconsider the ban which be introduce as temporary measure in order to allow those with an exist bass entitlement to

reduce it as much as possible we co operate with not only farmer processor and retailer but all those involve in the sector to try to make sure that we provide reasonably price food basket for our constituent the good news be that the cost of our food basket in the uk be low than that find in many part of the european union on point of order mr speaker in response to question the secretary of state attribute another party position on europe to my party the alba party position on europe be to opt for the european free trade association thus maintain sovereignty over fishery and farming would be grateful if the secretary of state would correct the record call the secretary of state such be the confusion within the scottish national party that hope the house forgive for the mistake recognise that the hon gentleman have change his party and now be an alba member be happy to correct the record on point of order mr speaker would like your advice on the scheduling of business today number of people sorry but that be not relevant to the question we have just have the only way the hon gentleman can raise that as point of order be by do it after we have do all the question we now have question to the attorney general attorney general the attorney general be ask fraud and economic crime prosecution what step she be take to help ensure effective prosecution of perpetrator of fraud and economic crime what step she be take to help ensure effective prosecution of perpetrator of fraud and economic crime what recent step her department have take to increase prosecution rate for fraud and economic crime the crown prosecution service and the serious fraud office play crucial role in bring economic criminal to justice indeed this month the sfo charge two company director with fraud in relation to car lease scheme into which hundred of british saver pay about million the horizon post office scandal have appal the nation hundred of sub postmaster be wrongly prosecute and convict and many be jail although they be entirely innocent of any fraud on the other hand fraud be know and real estimate put it as high billion yet we have not claw back fraction of what have be steal why be the innocent leave to rot for so long while the guilty go free to enjoy the fruit of their covid crime the hon lady be absolutely right about the appalling miscarriage of justice agree entirely with everything she say about horizon and the post office as she know step be be take to address that and work be ongoing on covid crime the attorney general and meet regularly with the serious fraud office and the crown prosecution service to press for action on whatever be the press issue of the day the cps have charge number of individual in relation to precisely the fraud activity she refer to be the solicitor general aware that the home affairs committee be currently look at the whole issue of fraud and find huge problem with everything from romance fraud to fraud financing terrorism clearly there be an urgent need for much well join up work between agency and information sharing in this country as well as on the international front what discussion and experience have he have on which nation prosecute fraud more effectively than we do in this country my hon friend raise an excellent point commend he for his work on the home affairs committee and look forward to the result of that work which we will consider carefully the attorney general and meet regularly with the sfo and the cps to assess good practice and to see where lesson may be learn both internally and from abroad intelligence sharing go on between the respective agency in any event and we will look at what lesson can be learn from good practice here and abroad to take forward the point he raise in the past five year law enforcement agency include the cps proceed of crime unit have confiscate million from criminal those agency get to keep tiny percentage of recovered asset and virtually no fine to help they continue their work why be the government enfeeble the very organisation it rely on to win the fight against economic crime why will they not adopt labour invest to save model of enforcement commend the work of the enforcement agency which have rightly crack down on the fraudulent activity the hon gentleman refer to he be right that the government have tirelessly pursue criminal with view to recoup money to prevent those criminal from benefit from their ill get gain among number of positive outcome have be million be return to victim thank the solicitor general for provide detail about what be happen but since the pandemic fraud have cost the public purse more than billion much of that relate to the government own scheme public resentment be understandable because at the same time prosecution for fraud and money laundering have go down by more than since do the solicitor general agree that the time have come for more action and that we should seriously consider an economic crime fighting fund to reinvest seize asset and profit into improve law enforcement against fraud the hon lady be right that this be matter of huge public concern and understandably so the government work very hard during the pandemic to ensure that support be provide but clearly where people have take advantage of system that must be pursue that be why we be look at the fraud strategy for example and the economic crime plan part we will continue to drive forward to see what further action can be take every day old and vulnerable people be prey upon by fraudster and scammer be it online by phone or on the doorstep will my hon friend reassure my constituent and the country that the conservative government the police and the criminal justice system will do all they can to bring those immoral criminal to justice yes can my hon friend be right to draw attention to this as people be take advantage of be one of the great issue of our age it happen to member of society of all kind but particularly to those who be elderly and vulnerable work continue on number of sector charter which have be successful in bring forward positive outcome for example million scam text have be block we have take forward work on the online safety act as well as the charter refer to but assure my hon friend we will continue to see what more can be do call the shadow minister it be two year since the former anti fraud minister lord agnew resign in embarrassment over the government oversight of covid business loan scheme describe it as nothing less than woeful can the solicitor general tell we in the past two year how much of the miss billion seemingly write off by the prime minister as chancellor have be recover and what the government be do now to chase down the covid crook the hon gentleman be right to draw attention to this the public quite rightly expect the money that the government advance in good faith to help those who be challenge during the pandemic not to be the victim of fraudulent activity intelligence sharing go on between the serious fraud office which as he know prosecute the most serious case and the crown prosecution service which have already charge number of individual we will continue to do that both from our perspective and with the law enforcement agency to make sure that the crook to whom he refer be pursue safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill echr what recent assessment she have make of the compatibility of the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill with the european convention on human right would like to assure the house that the government respect their international obligation the law officer convention prevent from disclose outside government whether have give advice or even what the context of any such advice might be the bill to which the hon gentleman refer be currently in the other place and will be sure be discuss very fully there just this week we hear medium report that four rwandans have be grant refugee status in the uk in the past four month cite found fear of persecution at the same time the government would like we to accept that rwanda be safe country despite the home office accept that those individual face real threat of persecution can the attorney general tell we how we can send asylum seeker to rwanda under those circumstance we be ask parliament to look at the matter afresh not just to look at the fact as they be before the supreme court but to look at new circumstance evidence be publish on january to assist parliament in those deliberation we have assurance from the government of rwanda that the implementation of all measure within the treaty will be expedite and we will ratify the treaty when we be ready to do so call the snp spokesperson journalist and blogger who criticise the government be arrest threaten and put on trial with allegation of torture disappearance and suspicious death those be just some of the issue that human rights watch and amnesty have report on in rwanda when ask parliament to disregard establish legal principle such as the burden of proof and the need for evidence be the attorney general genuinely comfortable in pass the rwanda bill it be constitutionally proper for parliament to legislate in response to decision of the supreme court we do it all the time in the finance and tax space lord reed be careful to point out to the constitution committee in the other house that we do it follow the burmah oil case in the war damage act in this case urge the hon lady to look hard at the evidence that the government put before the house on january if the bill pass everyone must treat rwanda as generally safe for the transfer of individual under the treaty violence against women and girl prosecution what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for case relate to violence against woman and girl what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for case relate to violence against woman and girl we be steadily increase the number of rape case send to the crown court we be prepare to launch joint justice plan which will transform how the police and the crown prosecution service investigate and prosecute domestic abuse case will welcome my friend andriy kostin the ukrainian prosecutor general who be not quite here yet because his plane have not arrive in my office after question the relevance of that be that team of uk expert be support his office to investigate and prosecute case of conflict relate sexual violence in ukraine last july the then solicitor general the hon and learn member for mid dorset and north poole michael tomlinson tell the house in write answer to the hon member for strangford jim shannon new vawg strategy for be be develop for publication later this year that year have come and go as have that solicitor general so can the attorney general tell we the status of the strategy and its content who the government be consult and when it will be publish the hon lady take long term interest in these affair and she have discuss they for many year reassure she that great deal of work have be do the work in the rape sphere which reference early be very commendable after have really difficult time in prosecute rape for many year we be back up to level and indeed be exceed they the joint justice plan which will build on the rape work in the domestic abuse sphere will be ready very shortly we be say in the spring but think she will have to wait only few week the home affairs committee carry out an inquiry into the investigation and prosecution of rape one of our very clear recommendation be that police force need to have specialist unit to investigate rape for case to proceed to the cps and hopefully to court we know that we get well decision making and communication with victim and the cps if we have those specialist officer be the attorney general as surprised as be that not all police force have those specialist unit to deal with rape and sexual assault the right hon lady who do sterling work on the home affairs committee know that the police be not directly under my supervision but be proud to talk about the very close co operation between the police and cps specialist in this field which have really help together with some great granularity and push on the statistic to drive up rape prosecution she will be glad to know that in her area of yorkshire and humberside the number of suspect charge with rape have increase significantly over the last year my newton aycliffe constituent zoey mcgill suffer from appal knife crime when her son jack woodley be kill in she be now suffer again as one of the perpetrator be use social medium from custody to glorify himself do the attorney general agree that such action should be prosecute and that the consequence should be publicise to ensure that they become deterrent against other glorify themselves from our prison my hon friend highlight horrific case that be why it be so important that we crack down on mobile phone use and indeed mobile phone existence within prison the government have put in million to ensure that prison have airport style security to ensure that it be much more difficult for phone to get in incident such as he raise be very serious and commend he for do so as well as his constituent zoey and the northern echo which understand have be campaign on the issue prosecution of fraud how many prosecution have be bring by the serious fraud office for case of fraud connect with contract and financial support scheme the serious fraud office have bring no prosecution for case of fraud connect with the sfo deal only with the most complex and serious economic crime so the vast majority of such case would not fall within its remit the sfo work closely with other law enforcement agency to ensure that intelligence be share and the investigation be handle by the most appropriate agency it be staggering to hear the solicitor general refer to this as not serious or imply that it be not serious in the level of fraud report by his majesty revenue and customs in two financial support scheme sit between billion and billion with less than billion be recover consider that the uk government have already write off an alarming billion that they spend on protective equipment buy during the pandemic will he commit to routinely publish account include the number of prosecution and the cost of recovery for contract and support scheme the hon gentleman misunderstand my point the sfo deal with the most complex scheme not for second would have suggest that any such fraud be not serious of course it be but the vast majority of the crime to which he allude would be deal with by the cps indeed the cps have charge number of individual with precisely those sort of crime director of public prosecutions priority what recent discussion she have have with the director of public prosecutions on his priority for the crown prosecution service have regular meeting with the director of public prosecutions his priority align closely with those of the government namely tackle delay combat violence against woman and girl enhance our work with victim and drive improvement across the system it appear that almost every week on our street we see hate fill demonstration with antisemitism rife yet no action seem to be take the end result be that my hon friend the member for finchley and golders green mike freer have announce his decision to leave this place because of antisemitism and the threat against his person will my right hon and learn friend the attorney general take up the matter with the cps to ensure that that be the last such case and that antisemitism be prosecute properly in the way it should be my hon friend raise an important and serious matter reassure he that have be work closely with the cps which in turn be extremely close to the police to deal with these very significant issue the cps have be embed in the control room during the most serious of the march that have take place also reassure my hon friend that large number of prosecution have already start most of the one that have come to conclusion be necessarily guilty plea because prosecution take time but we all see sadly large uptick in that horrible crime after october last year and we be just start to get to the phase when trial be begin where people have not plead guilty hope he will take some reassurance from my answer and that he will come and see so that can talk he through some of the work we be do do the attorney general agree that key priority for the cps must be fix the flawed way that joint enterprise law be use and do she agree that no one should ever be convict of crime that they make no significant contribution to know the hon lady be time campaigner on joint enterprise and also know that the lord chancellor my dear friend in this place have also consider such matter very carefully government rule of law what recent step she have take with cabinet colleague to ensure the rule of law be uphold within government have always be clear that the rule of law be fundamental to our constitution and it be the duty of the law officer to uphold it as emphasise in my speech at the institute for government last summer and in my appearance before the house of lords constitution committee take that duty very seriously indeed engage not only with colleague across government but with student and other young people to ensure that the rule of law be protect not just now but for generation to come the horizon scandal have raise many important legal question range from the reliance on flawed evidence to the slow pace of the justice system in correct miscarriage of justice will the attorney general now address the implication for the power of organisation such as the post office to pursue private prosecution and in particular what oversight the crown prosecution service can or should have over the use of those power thank the hon lady for her serious question and would like she to rest assure that these matter be be consider very carefully within government the immediate priority be to take bold and novel action to right in so far as we can the wrong that have come about through the horizon scandal but slow timed but nevertheless urgent piece of work be to make sure that private prosecution be sufficiently scrutinise and inspect in future do my right hon and learn friend agree that the leaking of law officer advice for political or any other purpose be not only breach of the very important law officer convention respect the confidentiality of legal advice but damage to the public interest and contrary to the rule of law my right hon and learn friend make characteristically significant intervention have serve as both solicitor general and attorney general he will know very well the importance of the law officer convention to the working of government legal professional privilege generally be very important construct and something on which the client relationship rely in government it be if anything even more significant and when law officer advice be leak it have chilling effect on our ability to provide free frank and honest advice to the rest of government that be something wholeheartedly deplore and agree with everything my right hon and learn friend say call the shadow attorney general we have all read with deep concern last week interim ruling from the international court of justice regard the situation in gaza and labour be absolutely clear that hamas must release all remain hostage immediately that israel must comply with the icj order in full that the judgment of the court must be treat with respect and that all party must comply with international law as part of an immediate humanitarian truce and sustainable ceasefire ask the attorney general very simply do she agree with on all those point and be it the official position of the government to accept the authority of the court in this matter and even more importantly to urge israel also to accept the authority of the court and to implement its order in full as matter of urgency the right hon lady be right to call for international humanitarian law to be respect and civilian to be protect in gaza and join she in that call we be deeply concerned about the impact of what be happen on the civilian population in gaza too many have be kill and we want to see israel take great care to limit its operation to military target we regularly review israel commitment to ihl and believe that we in this house all call for an immediate pause that will allow aid to get in and hostage to come out afghan relocations special forces urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make statement on afghan relocation and assistance policy eligibility for afghan special force be grateful for the opportunity to update the house on development relate to the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme and to answer the specific question raise by the hon gentleman in relation to former member of commando force and afghan territorial force many colleague across the house be passionate advocate for applicant to the arap scheme whether they serve shoulder to shoulder with they in afghanistan or represent applicant and their family member who be resident in their constituency we owe debt of gratitude to those brave individual who serve for with or alongside our armed force in support of the uk mission in afghanistan defence be determined to honour the commitment we make under the arap scheme which be why we have robust check in place and regularly review process and procedure although many former member of the afghan specialist unit have be find eligible under arap and safely relocate to the uk with their family recent review of process around eligibility decision demonstrate instance of inconsistent application of the arap criterion in certain case the issue relate to tranche of application from former member of afghan specialist unit include member of cf and atf know as the triples have identify this issue through internal process we must now take necessary step to ensure that the criterion be apply appropriately to all those individual as such can confirm that the ministry of defence will undertake reassessment of all eligibility decision make for application with credible claim of link to the afghan specialist unit the reassessment will be do by team independent of the one that make the initial eligibility decision on the application the team will review each case thoroughly and individually write ministerial statement to that effect be table this morning and commend it to colleague further dear colleague letter will follow by close of business tomorrow it be the case however that arap application from this cohort present unique set of challenge for eligibility decision making some serve in their unit more than two decade ago and some while the afghan state apparatus be still in its infancy or yet to come into existence all together it be also the case that they report directly into the government of afghanistan mean that we do not hold comprehensive employment or payment record in the same way as we do for other applicant fully understand the depth of feeling that arap evoke across this place and beyond thank member from across the house for their ongoing advocacy and support for arap we have that same depth of feeling in the mod and in government and we will now work quickly to make sure that the decision be review and change if that be necessary thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question the triples afghan special force train and fund by the uk be some of the top target for taliban reprisal around triples face imminent deportation from pakistan to afghanistan and at least six member of the triples be report to have be murder by the taliban since the withdrawal from kabul minister have allow medium speculation to build for almost week before set out to parliament today the government plan to turn and look again at the application the minister highlight inconsistency in process the application failure flaw how be that allow to happen on his watch how long will the review take and what new information will be factor in tragically today decision could be too late for many do the minister know how many of the triples who be wrongly deny support have already be deport to afghanistan torture or kill what conversation have he have with pakistan to halt deportation of those who could now be grant sanctuary there be no time to waste the least the triples deserve be clarity over arap policy but for month public spat have play out between the minister for veterans affairs and the minister for armed forces we should all remember that the people who matter here be those afghans who have be leave in limbo fear for their life and their future that be why clarity matter britain moral duty to assist afghans be feel most fiercely by those in the uk force who serve alongside they many of whom sit on both side of the house british personnel who have offer reference to former triples say that they be never even contact by the ministry of defence many of their arap application be deny will such basic error happen again or will that be review properly the british public do not understand why afghan special force personnel who serve and fight alongside our troop and who be eligible for safety have not yet receive sanctuary here will the minister now sort this out know that the hon gentleman who have be advocate for some case and be as passionate about the matter as anybody will feel aggrieved as will many colleague around the house the responsibility of any minister be to own any failure of process that happen in their department and accept that responsibility the reality be that these be very difficult decision to make the hon gentleman say that the triples be fund by the uk government that be not entirely accurate they be fund as donor alongside many other donor into the government of afghanistan who fund the unit as he will well know from colleague on his own benches who command unit that work closely with the triples top up payment be make in order to generate loyalty and frankly to avoid the triples be poach by other coalition partner which have similar force of their own the record of those top up payment be very ad hoc take my responsibility for accuracy to the house seriously and can tell the hon gentleman in all seriousness that we have look for employment record and none of those ad hoc record of additional payment be available to we we have speak to colleague who have experience of these matter in the house and beyond to ask for any record that they have but even then lot of the record produce be those that be put together by charity advocate for the triples rather than contemporary record of those top up payment the reality be that whatever the challenge have be some decision be make in an inconsistent way that be why they must be review we will aim to get the review do as quickly as possible we anticipate that it will take around week before that we need to put in place the people who will do the review who will be independent of everything that have go before in the first instance it will be review of the robustness of the decision themselves and where it find that decision be not robust we will of course seek new information both from the applicant and from colleague in the house who have advocate for they the shadow minister make some good point about what this mean for people who be in pakistan it be impossible to say who of those who be not already in the pipeline as approve applicant have be deport we do not track that so can not answer his specific question but of course we will alert the government of pakistan to those who be include within the review so that they can enjoy the same protection from deportation as those who have already be approve and be await their onward move to the uk the shadow minister necessarily point to the politic and the alleged disagreement among conservative members that be the nature of his role but be simply not motivate by such thing the reality be that we be try our good to bring as many people to the uk from afghanistan as possible some decision be relatively straightforward because we hold the employment record but other be far more complicated although there have undoubtedly be some decision that be not robust and need to be review put on record that the people involve in make those decision across the mod have be work their hard and do their good stand up for their service and for what they have do and take responsibility for their shortcoming have be approach by people who be involve in train these and bost and they tell that they be the most loyal brave and most effective soldier who be operate in afghanistan as result they be the soldier the taliban fear the most which guess be why the taliban have be execute they in front of their family whenever they catch they the minister rightly say that we owe they debt of gratitude but this be more than that it be debt of honour can we ensure that both in our administration and in our relationship with pakistan we do everything to deliver on that debt of honour as quickly as possible we certainly will it be important to mention that the government of pakistan have often be the subject of question in relation to arap over the past year or so in my experience they have be incredibly co operative we be hugely grateful to they for that the limit on the speed of flow be not any problem with the government of pakistan but the challenge of get people out of afghanistan the reality be that no matter how many decision we review and no matter how many additional people we add as eligible for the scheme there be limit to how fast we can move people over the border into pakistan that will take time call the snp spokesperson thank the shadow minister the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard for secure this urgent question the department late number show that people have be grant entry to the uk and that have be give indefinite leave what have happen to the remain individual be they still wait for decision have any be eject as other have say those who be target by the taliban can not wait the minister indicate to the shadow minister that we be about to have discussion with pakistan but what discussion have already take place we be all concerned that pakistan be eject people finally the fear of persecution due to religion or political belief be qualifying factor under the refugee convention what consideration have the mod give to the compatibility of that qualifying factor with the arap scheme to take the hon gentleman last point first the mod be not consider asylum claim which be separate matter for the home office the mod be consider the case of people who claim to have serve alongside uk armed force although do not doubt the seriousness of the right to asylum the mod make no decision in that regard we have no responsibility for that part of immigration policy turn to indefinite leave to remain will need to write to the hon gentleman with the detail because my understanding of the immigration status of those approve to come to the uk under arap be that they have it immediately they be effectively citizen in that they have the right to immediately come here live and work there be no further immigration phase require after their arrival because the approval of their visa to come afford they all the right that indefinite leave afford they in the first place however will write to the hon gentleman to confirm that my understanding be correct and that he have not pick up something that be not aware of on pakistan refer the hon gentleman to my early answer genuinely could not wish for well engagement from the pakistan government with our high commissioner in islamabad and be grateful to the pakistani high commissioner to london who have similarly make himself available to whenever have need to speak to he the issue with people in pakistan be challenge pakistan have very large cohort of people whom the pakistan government regard as illegal migrant and whom they be seek to deal with that be their sovereign choice as nation and it be not for we to tell they that they must not however where we have be able to tell they that people be part of our scheme those people have be protect from deportation for that we be very grateful indeed far to the question ask by my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis we clearly owe these individual debt of honour what assessment have the minister make of the number of people who be affect and how many family there be what be the ministry of defence do to reach out to the family of these brave man and woman to ensure they can come here as they should have the right to do we think that about decision need to be look at again some of those will be entirely the right decision they just be not write up and document particularly well so it be difficult to say at this moment how many of the case that we will review will require further scrutiny what can say to my hon friend be that once we have carry out that initial review of the robustness of the decision that be take we will notify people if their case be up for review and additional information might be require while will set out the detail of that process in the dear colleague letter that will follow my expectation be that we will also reach out at that point to any colleague in the house who have advocate for that case so that they be aware that it be up for review and can similarly put forward whatever evidence they have be grateful to the minister for meet with recently to discuss this matter but give the unique nature of the relationship between uk force and the triples and give the commitment that have be make previously it be beyond bewilder that we have not get to this point soon the minister speak about instance of inconsistent application of arap criterion in certain case and have say that he take responsibility for that but can he give an assurance today that he will work at pace to put it right and what do he think it will mean for our international reputation will people trust we in the future be grateful for the constructive engagement that the hon gentleman have have with the department ever since the evacuation from kabul our meeting the other day be most instructive and much of what he say cause we to reflect in the way that we have do he should take much credit for that we be work at pace the hon gentleman have my assurance that we will continue to do so but we have be do so all along this be an incredibly difficult process that be consume ever large amount of horsepower within the department and rightly so because we owe these people debt however as have come up previously at defence question we must be careful not to set the expectation among our partner force that everywhere that the uk armed force operate now and in the future there will be an immigration angle to such partnering accept that there be reputational damage to the mod and that have an effect on my reputation too that be right that be ministerial accountability but push back gently against the idea that it will have an impact on the willingness of partner force to work with we do not think it be helpful if partner force think the reward for work with we be visa that do not work at all appreciate the minister comment and his commitment today but it be more than two year since the chaos of the collapse of the operation in afghanistan and this surely have come much too late there be still many people not just the triples but interpreter and people who work alongside the force trap in country that be hostile and threaten they with transportation back to afghanistan can he commit today to ensure with some urgency that all case be look at quickly and speedily and that we get as many people to safety as possible the case be be look at urgently in the wide arap cohort that the hon member describe that process have be much easy some time ago direct the excellent official who work on this instead of work through the pile of application to go to the employment record we hold for interpreter and other locally employ civilian and to focus on find they in the pile of application rather than go through all the application that may be spurious or less credible we will do so as quickly as we can but it take time and even once eligibility decision have be take if people be undocumented and many of the arap cohort be it be incredibly challenging to get they out of afghanistan and into safe country and that limit our rate of flow enormously on those in other third country we do all that we can through the excellent staff in our embassy and high commission to facilitate their movement out of those country however there be some country with whom we have quite challenging diplomatic relationship particularly at the moment and that make it particularly difficult that do not mean that we do not keep try and be very grateful to our ambassador and high commissioner for their effort but fundamentally we can not tell sovereign country what to do back in september the minister for veterans affairs tell this house that about afghans be access homelessness support and that be after the government have evict afghans include arap personnel from uk hotel could the minister confirm that there be still afghans access homelessness support will need to write to the hon member on that due to the high number of former afghani soldier whose life be at risk as long as they remain in afghanistan what conversation have the minister have with cabinet colleague on the possibility of additional safe route to the united kingdom these thing be discuss regularly as the hon gentleman would imagine there be an additional route to the united kingdom in the afghan citizen resettlement scheme indeed our arap and acrs offer cover all afghan citizen who serve alongside our armed force or work alongside our diplomatic mission or who be simply prominent in afghan government and society and for whom we therefore feel that relocation be necessary for their protection up to point arap and acr be match not quite in their generosity but in their scope by scheme in many other country that be part of the nato force in afghanistan the wide donor community for afghanistan so the opportunity for people to leave afghanistan and resettle elsewhere be enormous we should be proud of the uk scheme which today announcement notwithstanding be incredibly generous we be move at the good pace we can to move people out of country where that be very difficult think the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis could not have put it well when he talk about the debt of honour we owe all those who serve with our armed force in afghanistan be sure that member on all side of the house will be appal at the fact that year later the situation be still not completely resolve the minister rightly highlight the challenge pose by lack of documentation in some case but give that for those individual obtain documentation will often mean apply to taliban control passport office will the minister say how the government be ensure that those affect have route to get the necessary documentation in safe and efficient manner no be not go to share that detail with the house because it be in absolutely nobody interest for the taliban to know how we be do that call jim shannon think happy birthday be in order madam deputy speaker if you be like you do not count the year you just make the year count thank the minister for his very positive answer ask this question simply because meet gentleman in pakistan about month ago on this issue he work for the british army alongside those in the special force so it be wonderful news that special force in afghanistan will have their application review wholly welcome that but want yet again to highlight the need to do the right thing by other as well as those who put their life on the line in afghanistan as part of the rebuilding effort and who have find themselves hide away out of sight in pakistan for example because they be not yet safe ask the minister for consideration to be give to review of application for interpreter and those who provide sustained assistance to our force and who live life in darkness and in fear as say in response to early question the interpreter and those who work alongside we in support function be much easy to find within the pilot application because we have the employment record and be therefore able to confirm their service easily if the hon gentleman would like to write to about the specific case raise with he will endeavour to get he answer as quickly as can business of the house be to ask the leader of the house if she will give we the forthcoming business the business for the week commence february will include monday

unacceptable and we must do more to protect our freedom and democracy we stand together yesterday alison phillips be bang out of the newsroom in her last day as editor of the daily mirror alison break the mould for female journalist and she lead number of campaign that have direct effect on this place she leave proud legacy last week ask the leader of the house about the procedure committee report

ministers finally come forward with statement this week on the ongoing conflict in gaza and israel will the leader of the house ensure that that happen more often with the foreign secretary himself take question the situation demand it the international court of justice interim ruling be deeply significant and make for difficult reading we be clear that israel must comply with the order in the ruling in full and that hamas must release all the hostage immediately international law must be uphold and the independence of international court respect with all side hold accountable for their action twenty five thousand innocent people be dead include thousand of woman and child and of the population of gaza have be displace and million face the risk of famine we can not let innocent palestinians pay the price we must redouble our effort for sustainable ceasefire and political process for two state solution on that welcome the foreign secretary willingness to recognise the state of palestine which be policy we have long support we hear this morning that secretary of state blinken be move the us in that direction too as the leader of the opposition say it be an inalienable right of the palestinian people can the leader of the house clarify as there be some confusion the government policy on the recognition of palestine talk of secretaries of state be accountable perhaps the leader of the house can clear up some of the creative use of language by the home secretary in his appearance before the home affairs committee yesterday apparently we no long have backlog of asylum claim it be just queue of applicant some queue but definitely not backlog the asylum seeker who have go miss apparently be not miss but have simply disengage do the leader of the house recognise that the government have lose control of the asylum system and that smoke and mirror can not hide the truth the business secretary be not exactly forthcoming with the truth this week either on monday she tell this house that negotiation with canada to save british car import be ongoing but now we learn that she walk out of those discussion and the entire issue be on pause do the leader of the house want to take this opportunity to correct the record finally can not let business question go by without refer to the leader of the house rather bizarre unprompte over the top glow tribute to the prime minister in last week business question feel the lady do protest too much it be as if she be at the traitors roundtable desperately want everyone to believe she really be faithful it seem that the traitor sit among they still secretly plan their next kill the evil plotter be try to avoid banishment so they can win the prize can she reveal herself today because we all want to know perhaps some of her colleague can too or perhaps they should do we all favour cut straight to the endgame and let the public decide quite honestly much as love the traitors this be not tv show and their antic have real life consequence as much as we be all sick of watch it unfortunately there be no off switch from the government benches say happy birthday to you madam deputy speaker this week

time foreign commonwealth and development office ministers include the foreign secretary have make appearance in parliament respond to parliamentary question and in select committees on gaza the hon

the tees tory mayor in everything from governance and transparency to failure to provide his own board with the necessary information to make decision to the lack of scrutiny over value for public money do the leader of the house agree that that be sufficient reason to call in the national audit office even before the late private eye revelation that million be pay by the mayor development corporation to the organisation control by two local businessman to move rubble from one part of the site to another without any contract be not sure whether the hon gentleman be simply make suggestion to you madam deputy speaker or whether he be offer to purchase you glass of whisky hope the latter labour be focus on teesside the last few month have be the first time for that really for

the international court of justice rule that claim of genocide in gaza be plausible two day later during settler conference in jerusalem alongside other government ministers itamar ben gvir the israeli minister of national security state that encourage emigration from gaza be necessity be sure that many colleague across the house would agree that that sound dangerously like an advocation of ethnic cleansing of palestinians from gaza so will the leader of the house find time for debate in government time so that this house may express its view on whether it be now appropriate to issue target sanction against any individual organisation or state that be find to have incite or commit war crime or incite ethnic cleansing or genocide understand why the hon gentleman raise concern about that issue all member of the house be concerned about what be happen in the middle east we want to see civilian protect and an end to hostility key to that be ensure that israel be safe and secure and that its citizen who have be kidnap and be be hold hostage be return the hon gentleman will have hear what the foreign secretary have say on those matter he have be do huge amount of work particularly over the last week talk to nation in the region which can particularly help to secure all those aim urge all right hon and hon member to think about what they say on the floor of the house and whether it help or hinder that situation this chamber be not an international court accusation about genocide or ethnic cleansing should not be make it be about ensure that the right body be oversee matter be sure that if the hon gentleman ask for briefing on how the government be do that whether through our partnership in the ministry of defence or at the foreign commonwealth and development office he would be very reassure by the oversight that be be provide trust in politics matter will the leader of the house make statement set out the importance of every single member ensure that any information they present to the house as fact be accurate and that when mistake be make as they sometimes will be member have duty to correct the record in early course out of respect for other member and those we represent do she agree that correct inaccurate information provide in error be sign not of weakness but of strength and honour value to which we should all aspire hope that my past action on that matter speak volume and do that job where have give the house incorrect information have correct the record the hon lady be quite right sometimes mistake happen and they should be correct with regard to the motivation for her question refer she to what say yesterday far to point of order the figure that she be work off from house of commons library paper be from the snp budget in they be out of date write to the secretary of state for health and social care on october to ask whether the department would consider reopen the state of the art rutherford cancer centre in bomarsund in my constituency give the lengthy and lengthen cancer waiting list in my area of the north east receive letter from the department only this week three month later suggest that to operate as nhs cancer centre the rutherford site need to meet nhs specification and we be advise by nhs england that they do not the reality be that other rutherford cancer unit in taunton and in clatterbridge in liverpool have joint partnership with the nhs the rutherford centre in bomarsund have have referral from the nhs so this be absolute humbug will the leader of the house consider debate in government time on fairness and equity in the frequency of diagnostic cancer treatment and so on across the country not forget the north east of england order before call the leader of the house should say that significant number of members wish to participate and there be some very serious business to follow so would be grateful if member on both side of the house ask question and do not make speech as the hon member for wansbeck ian lavery know the department of health and social care oversee the national cancer plan although do not know the background to his constituency issue suspect it will be matter for local commissioner will make sure that the secretary of state for health and social care have hear what he have say today but he may need to direct the issue to local commissioner the office for budget responsibility be responsible for give clear advice to the government on their fiscal and budgetary strategy have the leader of the house note that the other day senior representative of the obr say that the government figure be work of fiction because the projection for cut after the election have never be print will she comment on that be it work of fiction can we have debate on the obr and its role suggest that the hon gentleman should raise that directly with the treasury he will not have long to wait as the next treasury question will be on february remind he that we establish and continue to support the obr which have do great deal of work to ensure that the kind of mismanagement that happen before do not happen again recent court document appear to

week later be tempt to ask the leader of the house whether we can have debate on the basic competence of the scottish government but instead ask she whether there be any mechanism for further statement on levelling up funding or on any other mean that we can use to get funding to an essential community regeneration company such as clyde gateway be very sorry to hear about that situation can tell how disappointing it be to the hon gentleman but it will also be very disappointing to his constituent will ensure that the secretary of state for scotland have hear his concern and worry there be not enough hour in government time or hour that the chairman of the backbench business committee could give this house to fully examine and debate the level of incompetency that the scottish government be so renowned for be very sorry to hear about this particular incident which the hon gentleman have now put on the record it be always pleasure to ask the leader of the house question this

business of the house which be fine this week business have also be alter again understandably give the importance of the northern ireland motion for approval and the united kingdom internal market

general debate on miner and mining community and the motion for freedom and democracy in iran frankly that be not acceptable can you advise the house mr speaker on how back bencher can have their voice hear in this place far to that point of order mr speaker be happy to respond to the hon gentleman and understand his disappointment hope there will be good amount of time for backbench business debate the chairman of the backbench business committee the hon member for gateshead ian mearns who be sit next to the hon gentleman will know that be keen to accommodate and give time for these important debate and to support the innovation that be the backbench business committee it will be for the house to decide the length of time it take on these two statutory instrument yesterday there be considerable representation for more time to be give and for the house to have mechanism to allow the si to be take individually the government listen and on this important matter we think it be important that the house have that time the only thing can add be that the hon gentleman be sit next the hon member for gateshead ian mearns who be sure will offer very sympathetic ear and hope could

question ask for further detail the answer come back on january the government be in the process of appoint clinical legal and social care expert to advise the cabinet office on detailed technical

correctly to the house members and the wide general public thank the right hon lady for give notice of her point of order which be very important one as she well know be not responsible for the accuracy of statement that minister make in this house or in write answer nor have be give the power to police their accuracy however and think this be important be sure that those on the treasury bench will have hear her remark and the table office will be able to advise she on how to pursue this matter one thing do know be that the right hon member will not stop here today but will take all avenue open to she to ensure that she get response to the remark she have make again be sure that those on the treasury bench will have take that on board northern ireland we now come to motion on the draft windsor framework constitutional status of northern ireland regulation if the house give leave this can be debate with motion on the draft windsor framework uk internal market and unfettered access regulation be there an objection object since there have be an objection to the two motion be debate together we will take they separately beg to move that the draft windsor framework constitutional status of northern ireland regulations which be lay before this house on january be approve get devolution back up and run have be the principal focus of government policy in northern ireland since february when the then first minister resign the agreement that set out to the house yesterday be design to secure the wide possible support among the community in northern ireland for participate in the political process these regulation should be see and consider in the context of form part of package this package will safeguard and durably strengthen northern ireland integral place in the union and the uk internal market and it will do so by place commitment in that package into law the windsor framework constitutional status of northern ireland regulations affirm strengthen and future proof northern ireland place within the union underpin by the act of union and the term of the northern ireland act if the chancellor of the exchequer wish to lower the vat rate or to take something out of vat altogether will that be good law for northern ireland as well as for the rest of the uk and can we now set taxis for the whole country on the example my right hon friend have give of vat that have just be do for number of different thing believe the late one be solar panel but will check with those in the box there be various other product and will get an answer for my right hon friend but yes be the answer for vat and also for tax the regulation address the concern that have be express in part of the unionist community in northern ireland that its status have be diminish let say from the outset of our discussion that what the government want and the democratic unionist party want and which we have be our share determination to strengthen our union may sincerely recognise the effort of the right hon gentleman his team and his colleague in achieve what they have achieve over the last week one of the most encouraging thing in the last week be that leader within nationalism and unionism have all emphatically say they want to make northern ireland work we all have different view on the constitutional future and that discussion and debate be ongoing but if unionist want to make northern ireland work and nationalist want to make northern ireland work regardless of that everyone benefit completely agree with the hon gentleman it have be pleasure to work with all the party leader over the time have be secretary of state be absolutely convinced indeed have see this on number of occasion that they can work together behind the scene it be strike last february when detective chief inspector john caldwell police officer be shoot by dissident republican how all the political leader of northern ireland come together in such strong repudiation of that attack have see they work together behind the scene on whole host of thing and know that when stormont be up and run they will be able to deliver strong government make the right decision for northern ireland and make northern ireland much more prosperous place thank he for his intervention and he be absolutely right again let say from the outset that what unite the government and the dup be our share determination to strengthen our union there be memorial service on tuesday for somebody who think never get enough credit for his role in the peace process peter brooke once say that britain have no selfish strategic interest in northern ireland and that be later repeat in the downing street declaration read the command paper it seem to that the government have move from that position which think undermine the good friday agreement they seem to have move away from the principle of rigorous impartiality do the secretary of state agree with peter brooke assertion and the downing street declaration or be he move to different place disagree with what the hon gentleman say at the end of his intervention and completely agree with what sir peter brooke say at the time and our commitment to the belfast good friday agreement in all of its different facet want to stress our determination to strengthen the union and the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson have powerfully argue that strong and effective devolution deliver thriving northern ireland within our united kingdom be the sure way to ensure that this united kingdom remain united in the time ahead in take the step he have take he be deliver far more for the future of northern ireland in the union than any of his detractor can the secretary of state give list or summary of what those who be against the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson feel they have actually achieve in their month of campaigning would love to be able to outline anything have piece of paper with that on it oh it be blank nothing absolutely zero be hold up the piece of paper be afraid that the back of postage stamp be too big to write what they have achieve the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson have achieve so much in this deal in guard the union and his detractor have not come up with anything the change the right hon gentleman have secure in these regulation and the other instrument before this house which we will consider shortly will far enhance those protection the regulation end any presumption that there be any form of automatic and unchecked dynamic alignment with european good rule section of the european union withdrawal act the so call pipeline of eu law be now expressly subject to the operation of vital democratic safeguard that the northern ireland assembly when sit will be able to exercise include the stormont brake indeed when emphasise when stormont begin to sit again and first assemble will be able to sign that stormont brake legislation into law and it will be available to be use by the assembly as we move forward when parliament pass the act it be exercise its sovereignty so that the uk eu withdrawal agreement could be implement in domestic law the secretary of state indicate that there be now vital democratic use the plural term to guard against eu law include the stormont brake can he tell we what the other safeguard be yes we have the withdrawal act itself and the right hon gentleman be sit in the place that safeguard our law themselves it be right that we be update domestic law to reflect the fact that democratically elect representative in northern ireland will now be able to reject new and amend eu law and that the withdrawal agreement implementation be subject to robust scrutiny the ability of ministers to govern be already severely constrain by thing like the human rights act what worry about this be not the deal as such be brexiteer and want dynamic and deregulated economy so what happen when we try to diverge from eu law will some civil servant have to sign this off will it be question of no minister before we even get to the house of commons can the secretary of state therefore assure that we will be able to enjoy our brexit freedom under this deal thank my right hon friend for his question which have be put before it be put yesterday and it be genuinely fair question can honestly say that this package of measure will not change the freedom and power we have secure through leave the european union or through the windsor framework it will not reduce our ability to diverge or our commitment to do so should it be in the interest of the united kingdom and if the legislation do carry significant adverse effect of course the house would expect the minister to set out any step to be take in response to that assessment as my right hon friend may expect shall now refer to section and ask he question about it on the amendment make under the statutory instrument which be not by act of parliament of course the arrangement under section of the european union withdrawal act state that the parliament of the united kingdom be sovereign and that its sovereignty subsist notwithstanding section of the act include the windsor framework my right hon friend will know what be say in practice and in law constitutionally there be the capacity for override not only the withdrawal agreement and the protocol but the windsor framework as result of what be contain in those word note my hon friend point as say yesterday hope he recognise what we be do in this statutory instrument make northern ireland place in the united kingdom strong addition to the section as say to he yesterday his original clause have be big part of the solution to this conundrum be grateful to he for it and completely understand the point he have just make and thank he for it from listen to the secretary of state and read the command paper we would perhaps think there be only the democratic unionist party in northern ireland and no people with any other constitutional preference but of course there be many people in the north of ireland who want to see new ireland as soon as possible despite what might be in the command paper and what the secretary of state and other have say do he agree that the good friday agreement be sacrosanct and that it be absolutely clear that if people vote for constitutional change that be what will happen that it be not up to the british government or anybody else it be up to the people of ireland north and south yes nothing that we be do here change that fundamental principle the hon gentleman be absolutely right to make that point and hope have clarify it for he properly far to the point make by the hon member for foyle colum eastwood the difficulty be that in the eye of unionists the northern ireland protocol undermine the principle of consent which be at the heart of the good friday agreement do the secretary of state agree that these new measure and the legislation reset the balance so that the principle of consent and the will of the people of northern ireland alone will determine the future of our country as part of the united kingdom yes and think the right hon gentleman and the hon member for foyle colum eastwood be make exactly the same point and rightly so they represent two community that have govern by consent in the past and what we be do here today be try to get government by consent back up and run in stormont in the future as one who in live memory serve as minister responsible for the environment and for agriculture in northern ireland because the northern ireland political process be not work may say that as well as the exercise in syntax and the like in the writing of these instrument the key point be that the assembly should be effective and ministers should come from northern ireland do the job we do not want to have to do from westminster anyone who ever become father of the house be obviously wise and well experienced and that be particularly wise comment from particularly well experienced hon member my hon friend be completely right in everything he say crucially this legislation will also change the law so that new regulatory border between great britain and northern ireland can not emerge from future agreement with the european union that be an important new safeguard to future proof northern ireland constitutional status no government in the future can agree to another protocol neither can the uk internal market be salami slice by any future agreement with the european union this legislation will also introduce safeguard so that government bills that affect trade between northern ireland and other part of the uk be properly assess minister in charge of such bills will need to provide my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh raise this point write ministerial statement to parliament as to whether bill would have significant adverse effect on trade between northern ireland and another part of the united kingdom if the legislation do carry that significant adverse effect the house would expect the minister to set out any step to be take in response to that assessment indeed we have select committee chairmen present and they would expect to do high level of scrutiny in that space this be very good transparency measure that we should all welcome the secretary of state have repeatedly say that the deal we be look at today will not prevent britain from diverge from eu law which be obviously welcome on page of the command paper it state we will also set out plan to introduce legislation in the spring that would avoid new regulatory divergence between gb and ni on veterinary medicine be the command paper say that in that area there will be no future divergence if my right hon friend go through paragraph to of the command paper she will see we state that we know that the current situation be not right we have grace period that will run out soon and we want to find solution similar to the one we find for human medicine it have be suggest that we set up work group of expert and people who truly know and care about this subject to look at this matter quickly and come to ministers and parliament with solution that we will take to our european partner and negotiate hard to get and we want to do that the situation be not quite as she state there be process to get to point where we have settle view from this house and indeed from expert from northern ireland in this space so that we can move forward on this matter know it be important to all member from northern ireland as be say before that intervention the si will increase transparency by ensure that parliament be present with evidence of the gb ni trade impact of relevant legislation before proceed with it the concrete step we be take and enshrine in law will deliver clarity to business that northern ireland unfettered access to the uk internal market will not be threaten by new regulatory border finally with this legislation the government will provide for additional duty and further requirement in statute regard the operation of an independent review of the windsor framework reflect our steadfast commitment to ensure that the framework operate on the basis of the broad cross community support as secretary of state will be put under duty to commission review within one month of the assembly have pass consent vote but without cross community consent and will be oblige to respond to the report from that review within six month that constitute new and important commitment by this government all those step we be take be design to ensure that tangible action be take off the back of review and solution be find government ministers be be place under legal duty to raise the content of the review at the uk eu joint committee on the withdrawal agreement can the secretary of state provide little further clarity about the independent review of the windsor framework he will appreciate the spectrum of view on the windsor framework and it be worth state that most people in northern ireland most elect representative and most business be pragmatic about it although there be those who be oppose to it can he assure we that it will be genuinely independent review that take on board the full spectrum of opinion not least in the context of the assembly potentially have confirm at that stage ongoing support for the windsor framework can give the hon gentleman that confirmation it will be for minister to make sure that the panel be completely independent on the regulatory issue in northern ireland several law have be pass in europe we hear that up to have go through since we agree to leave and some of those be already in place in northern ireland as part of the review be it possible to look at those that have be implement to make sure that we get rid of those that we can that mechanism should be in place the review will be base on the entirety of law but essentially it have to look forward the hon gentleman be right that there be always pipeline of european union law be member of the european parliament for year and see at first hand the quantity of law that come from the european union the point would make to he be that have we be able to get to this place early we would have have the stormont brake in operation early and northern ireland assembly member might well have be able to trigger the stormont brake and see it in action very much hope that we will see it in action in the future to demonstrate its worth in this space it be worth make the point that while the secretary of state be right in his response on the review which be the subject of the rightful concern raise by my hon friend the member for south antrim paul girvan he be also right to focus on the democratic scrutiny and accountability mechanism that be not before we today but it have be legislate for and it be change to the northern ireland protocol the secretary of state will also know that in this statutory instrument there be proper amendment be make here in the uk parliament to section of the european union withdrawal act which relate in particular to that pipeline to give sense of how regulation have be change through this process on tuesday evening when the european union and the uk government reach agreement on what be contain in the red lane for rest of the world product page or more of legislative text and change be publish that show the benefit not only have this legislation deal with regulatory barrier that could be create in the future as part of the overall package some of those barrier have already be remove could not have put it well myself the hon gentleman be knowledgeable about the subject and have be well involve in the negotiation behind the document and the statutory instrument we be talk about he be right do my right hon friend who himself be on the european scrutiny committee recognise that we be constantly monitor these thing indeed the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson be on that committee have the pleasure of serve for five year on the european scrutiny committee under the wise chairmanship of my hon friend and he be absolutely right that scrutiny be what this house do well the select committee system be there to scrutinise all aspect of legislation what the government do and what come our way know his expertise have experience it when we be member of the european union wad through the hundred of different explanatory memorandum that come the committee way be quite job and quite responsibility one of the commitment we have make be that we will make sure that information be freely available to assembly members in northern ireland when they take their seat to ensure that they can undertake democratic scrutiny of proposal that might well affect northern ireland so that they have the information they need to use the stormont brake should they so choose scrutiny be vital part of all this the secretary of state and everyone on these benches will know that over the past two year have do lot of consultation and have lot of discussion with party group community group the orange order those in the nhs and many other people as well seek their opinion from all that come where we be today suspect that this legislation be not the fulfilment of everything we would wish to see and with that in mind ask one question the constitutional legislation and the legislation to secure our place in the internal market be here but and my constituent retain some level of concern so press the government for more assurance it be highlight yesterday that european law might be overrule by the government but that wording suggest they may also be accept allow northern ireland to diverge want the answer secretary of state do the last word lie in this place or do it lie with the eu when it come to make those decision actually for an element of law that would be trigger by the stormont brake think the big say would be with assembly members though this place parliament be sovereign and the hon gentleman will know that this place have already choose for great britain to diverge from northern ireland that have happen on the matter of animal welfare and livestock export and for good reason northern ireland have land border and vociferous and lively trade in live animal export with the republic of ireland and be we to extend the ban in great britain to northern ireland that would affect the export of about cattle pig sheep and so on those be the figure for livestock move to ireland from northern ireland in this place already make such decision and it will continue to do so the secretary of state be at odd in make that argument that be one argument that the minister for food farming and fisheries make in say why northern ireland should be exclude but the reason give be that because northern ireland be part of the eu single market there could not be discrimination between cattle be transport to the republic of ireland and cattle be transport thousand of mile away to the south of italy that be the real reason why this house once again find itself subservient to eu rule in northern ireland be afraid that the right hon gentleman be completely wrong know that he have write to my right hon friend the minister for food farming and fisheries have his reply which be copy into expound that some sort of carve out should be make but this be on the basis of range of international agreement and their core principle and that include the world trade organisation as good eurosceptic as be be careful not to blame the wrong organisation for the wrong thing we have sign up to world trade organisation rule and we benefit from those rule one element of this issue be world trade organisation rule and he be pick the wrong thing to point his finger at those rule prevent discrimination against different country in all sort of way and they be important vital rule be afraid that on this particular point he be completely wrong have long be clear to right hon and hon member that serve in the government proudly as unionist be pleased that the regulation which commend to the house will address the concern express by part of the community in northern ireland in past year that our union of nation have be somehow diminish as whole the regulation demonstrate that the government have listen so that trust can be rebuild so that people and business can be reassure that they be in the uk long term future and so that we can see northern ireland political institution restore we be obviously debate the regulation but may point right hon and hon member to annex of the government safeguard the union command paper which provide an excellent summary of the historical context of the act of union include article many keyboard warrior across northern ireland be not sure what they have achieve in the last eight month other than to create whole kerfuffle would be well advise to read it they would see that none of the act of union be under threat in any way thank my right hon friend for make that point he be right that lot of noise and heat have be generate in many way by people who have do absolutely nothing in this space they be try to cloud the reality that he express and which we have set out in annex for everybody to see very much hope that right hon and hon member will welcome the progress we have make in deliver the agreement by support the passage of these regulation and that in come day they will join in welcome the return of stormont so that the assembly and the executive may serve the people of northern ireland once more thank the secretary of state for be generous in give way as he know always try to be constructive it be for all the people out there include my constituent who have concern and probably do not have trust in the government for genuine reason forgive but we have be let down on number of occasion that ask the secretary of state to reiterate this once again my apology for ask he to do so with his hand on the dispatch box we all know what that mean and be aware of the duty of his position will he answer in simple term for my constituent do this deal constitute the renewal of our place in the constitutional and economic united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland as fully and as completely as any other area in this great uk believe that it someone want to send good from gb to ni would naturally expect to use the new internal market lane the green lane who decide whether they would not be allow to do so would it be the eu the uk government or the stormont executive it be the uk government in that area far to that point in respect of paragraph of the command paper will the secretary of state outline whether he expect further si in the pipeline to give full effect impact and clarity to the issue raise in this wide range document we will give legal direction to the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs on these matter we will use other legal instrument for the deal but it be for we to give legal direction to daera on that point we all accept that the dup have particular issue about all this but do the secretary of state accept that it be not good practice in northern ireland to have one government one party process will he commit in the future to have much more inclusive process for deal with these type of issue thank the hon gentleman for that point he make it fairly to be honest with he there be one party that be stay out of government and that party represent community do try to keep he as update as could throughout the process as we have do with the other political party but need to talk more to the party we need to persuade to go back into government in future will always try to treat everybody equitably but hope the hon gentleman understand that have to ensure there be an agreement that the democratic unionist party could stand behind so that could start to rebuild the trust the hon member for strangford jim shannon use the word have be lose between the democratic unionist party and the united kingdom government that be something we have to do between the two of we be grateful to the secretary of state for give way again think it have to be understand that there be more people in northern ireland than just the dup and unionism think nationalism feel that north south have be undermine by the massive emphasis put on east west ask he to think carefully about that for the command paper undermine the good friday agreement undermine north south and go far too far in the direction of the dup thinking the hon gentleman be friend of mine so hope that he do not mind my disagree with he on this the command paper will hope deliver the restoration of stormont the most important strand institution of the belfast good friday agreement it will also allow for ministers to be appoint to the north south ministerial council an important institution in different strand of the belfast good friday agreement which could then function properly what the command paper do be allow for all strand of the belfast good friday agreement to start hum again as they should he will have to forgive but must disagree with he on that point be grateful to my right hon friend for be so generous do it not all boil down to this as be outline in annex it be important to distinguish between northern ireland integral place constitutionally within the united kingdom and its internal market and the access it have to the single market as result of its unique position those two word the difference between access and its constitutional place be what we really need to focus on when try to square this circle agree with my right hon and learn friend the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee he make an important point eloquently as ever mr speaker sorry madam deputy speaker it be very nice to see you in your place and be sorry do not see you come in the regulation undoubtedly will strengthen union it be for that reason and more that wholeheartedly and unequivocally commend they to the house be grateful to the secretary of state for his explanation of the first set of regulation that we be consider and join he in want to see the institution up and run again as soon as possible welcome the measure and the opposition will support they ever since our leave the eu create the problem that have cause northern ireland to be without government for two year we have be try as nation to find common sense way through the si be continuation of that process to balance two objective first to enable the free flow of trade between northern ireland and great britain and secondly to make sure that good that enter the republic across the open border meet the single market rule we should note the further commitment to which reference have be make contain in the command paper publish yesterday we look forward to regulation and guidance to implement they where require perhaps with little bit more time to read they although understand completely and support the timetable we be deal with today commend the right hon member for skipton and ripon julian smith for draw the house attention to the annex of the command paper on the history certainly learn some thing from read it have hear the argument that there be always free and unfettered trade and now that have change only to discover that the government of ireland act require that the movement of good between great britain and northern ireland be treat as export and import and that custom officer be instruct to conduct physical inspection of ship and daily sailing twice weekly at check rate of it be jolly good idea to understand one history when try to deal with the problem of the future some suggest that the act of union should be as they be in but my hon friend the member for north antrim ian paisley would be perplex to discover that bottle of bushmills whiskey distil in his constituency would have tariff add to it to be sell in great britain the rest of the united kingdom do the right hon gentleman agree that we certainly do not want to go back to that be teetotaller so perhaps do not feel the suffering in that example in the same way as other member however the right hon gentleman be an observant student of northern ireland history and he make his point extremely forcefully do the right hon member recognise the difference between tariff be put on by this parliament or the assembly or parliament in northern ireland where the people of the country elect representative who take decision on tariff that act as an impediment to trade and tariff impose by an outside body such as the eu which be the case in northern ireland that be how the act of union be be disrupt because an outside body can interfere with it we have see quite lot of disruption to arrangement in recent year have we not the point try to make moment ago be that our departure from the european union cause problem everybody know that there would be problem between northern ireland and the republic because of the open border that everyone continue to support think say last week that it be about the only thing in brexit where there be agreement if there be problem we have to find way through it what we be grapple with here and have do previously and may do in the future be how to solve that problem which be the result of democratic decision take by the british people turn to these particular regulation part of they update previous legislation to include reference to the windsor framework which come after those piece of legislation or reaffirm for clarity the exist legal position welcome the prohibition make by regulation of any agreement with the eu that would create regulatory border between great britain and northern ireland however if we be to form the next government labour would seek to negotiate sanitary and phytosanitary agreement with the eu with the intention of remove check on animal food and plant not only between gb and ni but between the whole of the uk and the eu that would benefit farmer food business the horticultural industry in northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom regulation amend section of the european union withdrawal act to include reference to the stormont brake procedure and the democratic consent vote note that the secretary of state say that the windsor framework democratic scrutiny regulations pass by parliament last march which think he say he have sign will take effect once the assembly be back up and run indicate assent see that the secretary of state be nod it be also important to remind ourselves of the significance of those regulation and the democratic check that they will create the stormont brake will be available to the assembly when the eu seek to amend or replace exist eu good legislation in annex of the framework the windsor framework give new role to the assembly to approve or reject any propose new eu legislation be add to the framework note that page of the command paper state that the full operational detail for the stormont brake will be set out in writing for the assembly can the secretary of state confirm when that will happen and what form it will take so that we in the house can see it do the right hon gentleman accept that there be distinction between new and amend legislation in this context they be not by any mean the same thing particularly as amend legislation can be very extensive take that point but we be talk about two separate category one be long list relate to the legislation that form part of the original protocol in the annex and the other relate to new stuff come from the european union do the shadow secretary of state recognise that there be different school of thought from some people and business in northern ireland around the stormont brake if there be degree of delay or uncertainty in the application of an update eu regulation that could inadvertently undermine northern ireland dual market access by create uncertainty for business seek to invest or remain in northern ireland by far the well way be for northern ireland institution to talk to the european union at the start to make sure that our concern be reflect as fresh eu law be undertake or update the hon member make an extremely powerful and useful point the business that have speak to in northern ireland support northern ireland access to the eu market in choose to pull or not pull the stormont brake there be many consideration which be sure elect politician in northern ireland will take into consideration let we be honest it depend on what we be talk about what impact will it have will it have really bad effect in which case people might reach for the brake other time it may be perfectly sensible change and nobody need to worry about it but there be mechanism that give northern ireland politician and the assembly the chance to decide between the two far to that point which be very good one would the eu not decide to use its power if stormont try to use the brake too often and change the amount of eu law that apply the stormont brake be the result of negotiation between the government and the european union it be really big step forward it be why we be have this discussion now and support it anything be possible in the future with regard to what one or another party that be engage in continue discussion and negotiation may seek to do but we have deal with the european union and it expect we to honour the windsor framework point have make in the house many time before and we would expect the eu to do entirely the same nobody can guard with absolute certainty against what may happen in the future we have to deal with the world as it be today what people have miss over the past few week be the cross party support for both the windsor framework and this deal the reality be that anybody campaign or continue to campaign against the decision democratically take by the democratic unionist party be campaign against something that this house have support in voting number could have only dream of when be the government chief whip during brexit this house support the windsor framework and the deal secure by the secretary of state and the prime minister the right hon gentleman make an extremely powerful point hope everyone will notice the near if not complete unanimity that we will see reflect in the house today those who wish to rail against reality and the fact that we have to make choice and deal with issue as they arise as the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson have so eloquently point out achieve nothing and contribute nothing what the house be try to do be to take this forward and crucially to restore the institution be not try to rail against reality be just seek the truth would it be fair summing up of the labour party position that it be supremely relaxed about all these future trading arrangement because if there be to be labour government they will have absolutely no intention of diverge far away from the eu from deregulatory point of view if the right hon gentleman become secretary of state there be no danger that any civil servant will say minister be careful about this labour be very relaxed about this matter it be go to get close and close to the eu be it it be very kind of the right hon gentleman to say that we be intensely relaxed about the prospect that we might form the next government and who be to disagree with he in that observation the point about divergence be that it be choice it be strike to note the number of instance since we leave the european union when the current government decide that they be go to diverge and then suddenly have second thought about it because it do not really make lot of sense make no apology for have give the example of the veterinary sps agreement that we would like to reach because it would help our business in the uk business in northern ireland and business in the european union that be my definition of common sense negotiation the decision have be make but that do not mean britain can not seek to improve the relationship we have with the european union in our interest and the interest of our european neighbour also welcome regulation which would require minister before the second reading of bill contain provision that would affect trade between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom either to make statement that it would not have such an effect or to set out the reason why the government want to proceed none the less it may be difficult at this stage but wonder whether the secretary of state in wind up could give we an example of the circumstance in which ministers might want to make use of the provision in propose new section to the european union withdrawal act find at the top of page of the regulation in other word in what circumstance would the government want to proceed with legislation even though it would have an adverse effect welcome the clarification make in regulation regard any independent review that may follow the democratic consent vote that vote by assembly members must take place as understand it by the end of this year have the secretary of state have any discussion with northern ireland political party as to when exactly that vote might take place or do he intend to do so or be it entirely matter for those party will return in the subsequent debate to the matter wish to raise on the uk internal market regulation madam deputy speaker now bring my remark to close there be obviously big time pressure on this debate want to bring the secretary of state back in at pm so urge colleague to be brief if they possibly can call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee will certainly bear that exhortation in mind madam deputy speaker this debate have properly focus on the statutory instrument that will amend primary legislation through the power of the act which my right hon friend the member for skipton and ripon julian smith and both spend lot of time deal with in its enactment however it be right to look again at what be outline in the helpful annex to the command paper in term of the history and the legal background to what the party have be deal with and why it be that many of the argument from the naysayer do not pass close scrutiny at all be delighted to see on page of the command paper clear exposition of the position with regard to the act of union say the act of union because of course there be more than the one in since that time the act have be amend and not just by the seismic event of they be amend right through the century and indeed beyond to take into account the evolve position of northern ireland just as every other part of our united kingdom have evolve so have northern ireland it be right to pause and say that the argument that be assert in particular in the supreme court about what we can now call the old protocol be inconsistent with the act of union be just wrong that point be never at issue before that court the court specifically say that it do not have to rule on it lot of this be quite surreal because it fall into the ground of piffle remember sit in the select committee on northern ireland and the then secretary of state for northern ireland the right hon member for skipton and ripon julian smith tell in october this will all be light touch you will even notice it we have spend the last four year now try to unravel the heavy hand of europe and still need to prise those finger off what be happen in northern ireland we have also be tell that yes there be problem and we all now know what the problem be this house fail to stand up to europe and allow northern ireland to be buffer zone to protect its single market and throw our single market down the toilet in the process feel the emotion and hear the proper point that the hon gentleman make the process become the legislative and constitutional equivalent of brain surgery and the patient be northern ireland everybody be feel it this be not just an archaic debate this be debate about the business and economy of northern ireland this be real and important for the business that right hon and hon member represent absolutely right which be why the hon gentleman party should claim proper credit for the painstaking approach that he and his colleague include the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson have show in this process they have not take no for an answer they have actually seek to try to reach solution and be part of that brain surgery process that neurological change but say gently to the hon gentleman that there be distinction between the integral part that northern ireland play in our united kingdom constitution and our internal market our single market and the inevitable access that northern ireland will have to the eu single market why because of the nature of the border that exist in northern ireland the unique nature of its status and all the history and indeed the reality that go with that that be why there be not go to be an elegant or perfect solution to all this it be always go to involve compromise compromise be difficult word it imply weakness and fudge it imply lack of clarity but right hon and hon member opposite have recognise that that be the world in which they operate which be why we be able to be here today to debate important change that will underpin not just declaratory word about northern ireland place within the uk internal market but concrete action that be set out in the command paper be think in particular of the operation of the stormont brake yes we need to see more guidance about its operation we need to understand the evidential threshold that will be require for mla to bring the brake to the attention of the uk government to lodge their objection that work have to be do but today will allow it to happen in its judgment the supreme court look in particular at the question of the sovereignty of parliament and affirm that as article of the act of union itself recognise it be the most fundamental rule of uk constitutional law there be nothing novel unexpected or controversial about that which be why some of the language that emerge from that case be not just unhelpful but wrong know that the right hon member for lagan valley the leader of the democratic unionist party share my view it be time for leadership and leadership mean be straightforward and get it right that be why commend the right hon gentleman and his colleague for the work that they have do they get it right and as result of their approach we be able today hope to pass this much need change welcome it warmly commend my right hon friend the secretary of state and commend this measure to the house call the scottish national party spokesperson my party and have never make any secret of our disagreement with brexit and the manner in which it be deliver that have certainly cause issue for we in scotland however we broadly welcome the point that matter have reach today it have be long road have clarity about northern ireland constitutional status be believe helpful as indeed be the reaffirmation of the principle of consent which be the basis on which many of we in scotland not just in northern ireland understand the union of which we be willingly or otherwise part the manner in which brexit have come about have as say cause issue in scotland it have place our own constitutional question back at the forefront and under renew scrutiny but despite the tension that that have release or bring about politically hope that my party and have be able to understand and empathise with some of the concern of people in northern ireland and not just over the way in which brexit as originally constitute threaten to undermine the basis on which peace and progress have be secure over the previous quarter century hope that my party and have also be able to understand and reflect on the fact that aspect of the protocol have leave unionists in northern ireland in particular feeling that they have be in some way separate or set on course of be separate from the uk in that regard as have say on number of occasion we never consider it unreasonable in and of itself in the light of experience that the uk government should seek to renegotiate or to rework aspect of the deal that have be put in place although there be certainly opportunity to recast deal which would argue could have work well in the interest of all part of the uk would highlight sanitary and phytosanitary alignment as be essential to that and while regret that those option have not be pursue today do not begrudge northern ireland single aspect of what have be agree in recent day or what appear in the statutory instrument the hon gentleman say that he do not begrudge we the achievement of some of the objective that we set out to achieve do he agree that one of the advantage that we have and scotland do not have be mile unclosable land border that make virtual accommodation with access to the irish republic and onwards into the wide eu market almost impossible to prevent the border be certainly complex one to try to police and that have be at the forefront of many of the discussion by contrast we have what would be very straightforward border between scotland and england be it ever to take on international significance there appear to be something of contradiction in that northern ireland can not conform to the requirement of the single market to maintain access there and also the uk internal market in the event of future divergence that bring to mind paragraph of the command paper which provide that the government will legislate to require that minister in charge must assess whether or not something have an impact on trade between great britain and northern ireland and make statement that contrast with new section of the si which state his majesty government must not ratify northern ireland relate agreement with the european union that would create new regulatory border minister might lay statement before parliament to that effect but that do not mean that the minister opinion will necessarily be share or make the statement any less subjective minister might be capable of think six impossible thing before breakfast and indeed at time during the brexit debate it seem that that be necessary qualification for office nevertheless would be grateful if the secretary of state in sum up the debate could clarify how any such dispute might ultimately be determine and resolve with these publication we appear to have reach something of conclusion it have be thoroughly exhausting process which have occupy talent and energy not just in the government and parliament here but across swathe of public life in northern ireland and beyond that could believe have be direct more productively much work have build up in the absence of an assembly but hopefully these provision will allow for all the political mechanism to bring the assembly back it be important for that to happen because peaceful prosperous northern ireland at ease with itself in control of its future and able to be respectful of all shade of opinion be manifestly in the interest of all people in all these island to the extent that the statutory instrument pave way towards restore that state of affair we support they rise order let once again emphasise the need for brevity so that we can get the majority of people in section of the european union withdrawal agreement act prescribe that parliamentary sovereignty will prevail notwithstanding section of the act the wording be bit difficult to read because one have to go through all the enactment to ensure that one have get it right but it do say include the windsor framework so for practical purpose our parliamentary sovereignty subsist however find it incongruous and rather lewis carroll that we should end up continue to maintain eu law in relation to northern ireland could make long speech about this but will not do so the fact be that no man can serve two master in respect of the wording of the statute let paraphrase the word of humpty dumpty word mean what we choose they to mean and the question be who be to be master that be all this be the problem this be the dilemma this be the basis on which most of the controversy occur and regret to have to say that it may ultimately be decide on some day in the future by the prospect of referendum that of course be what sinn féin have be ask for personally believe that we should protect northern ireland and have always do everything in my power to do just that have say that should also mention that my family have be involve in the irish question since the in this house for instance john bright and frederick lucas the member of parliament for county meath make that point to emphasise that take this very seriously and indeed pay respect to the member of the dup for the way in which they have fight for their interest there be some measure in the statutory instrument that can understand as have benefit but ultimately the question will turn on the issue of whether give the constitutional framework within which this be be present with all the assurance that we be hear and all the hopeful aspect which expect to be deliver we find that it will be decide by the test of time we will see whether it work there will be continue argument and continue debate but unfortunately have to say that just as with section of the european communities act there be no way in which section of the act have anything other than the same fundamental limitation as regulation under that section in that they can not contradict or restrict the scope of eu law it have to be say because it be the honest truth however that do not alter the fact that effort can be make the stormont brake may come in and may be able to make change say everything with reservation vote against the windsor framework because foresaw that issue of this kind would arise pay tribute to all the people involve in try to mitigate the ultimate impact of the windsor framework but the scope of eu law that still remain leave with serious concern as chairman of the european scrutiny committee end by say that we will be monitor this and we be concern be concern the devolved assembly be democratic plus we can not issue order from westminster to northern ireland if the people do not want it the bottom line be that those in the dup have real issue on their hand with sinn féin be that as it may believe they will do everything in their power to maintain their democratic right the chairman of the european scrutiny committee who be my friend have outline his concern about the constitutional future of northern ireland he will know that legislatively in it be settle that the future of northern ireland place in the uk be base solely on the decision make by the people of northern ireland he will remember that in gerry adams say that there would be united ireland by he will also know that today in the government who will have to decide whether there should be border poll have declare in the command paper safeguard the union on page paragraph on the basis of all recent polling the government see no realistic prospect of border poll lead to united ireland be extremely glad to hear the hon gentleman make that point to conclude simply say that you can read the crystal ball but the question be can you always read the book it be an honour to follow the hon member for stone sir william cash we truly value his continue interest in northern ireland the problem for dup members be that the origin of our difficulty be the withdrawal agreement itself and the decision to go with the northern ireland protocol sadly it place northern ireland in situation where we be separate from the rest of the uk in key element of the benefit that ought to have flow from brexit my task and that of my colleague ever since have be to repair the damage that decision do and it be work in progress do not pretend that we have complete the task recognise there be ongoing concern about how the new arrangement will work in practice and it will be our task to hold the government to account on their commitment and ensure that they be honour in full and deliver that be why my party executive mandate as party leader to proceed on the basis that we need the government to progress key element of the arrangement before we would recall the assembly and restore the executive welcome the publication of and the opportunity to debate the statutory instrument they amend key constitutional law of the uk in way that in my humble opinion strengthen northern ireland place within our united kingdom and reaffirm our place in the uk underpin by the act of union and by the principle of consent that be at the heart of the belfast agreement and the legislation that be to say as my hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson have state that the will of the people of northern ireland will ultimately determine our future nevertheless it be welcome that this parliament which be sovereign in our united kingdom reassert its sovereignty in regard to northern ireland and reaffirm our place within the uk thank my right hon friend and colleague for bring that forward he be absolutely right to state the fact say this with respect to the secretary of state and the government of the distrust that many unionist have for this process the opinion of this house on sovereignty should be clear and my party leader have seek not simply to secure but to future proof the legislation and the change the difficulty be that many people represent have state their lack of trust in the government who tell we that they would give we their good and do not do so how can the government and the secretary of state reassure the unionist people whom we represent that our sovereignty be protect thank my hon friend for his intervention he restate point he make early to the secretary of state and he will have hear the response give it be the task of all dup member to ensure that the government deliver and we bank the gain we have make in this process and move forward on that basis recognise not only that there be more to do but that there be new opportunity to seek and secure change the secretary of state refer early to my detractor who have be very vocal even challenge to debate on these issue my challenge back to they be clear and simple as say last week in this house when they be in position to set out clearly for the people of northern ireland what they have achieve the change they have secure to the protocol and to the windsor framework and the change they have secure to safeguard our place in the union will consider discussion with they but what will not do be accept their criticism of what we have achieve on safeguard the union real achievement and real change which my party have long seek we be disappoint when the government abandon the northern ireland protocol bill because all dup members recognise that those proposal provide way forward for northern ireland we have seek to incorporate into these new arrangement many aspect of that bill but we have go far and achieve more we will come to this more fully on the second si before we this afternoon but that bill which be endorse fully by my parliamentary party propose green lane and red lane as the mean by which good would move between great britain and northern ireland what we have achieve be to remove the need for the green lane because we have restore northern ireland place within the uk internal market under these new arrangement good move from great britain to northern ireland and stay within the uk will flow through the uk internal market system there be no need for so call green lane there be need for only one lane which deal with good that flow through our northern ireland port and onwards to the eu or that be deem at risk of enter the eu the red lane be endorse and support by my party and every one of my mp vote for that proposal that be my mandate and it be what have secure it remove the irish sea border within our internal market of the united kingdom and it mean the only check we need to carry out be those on good move into or at risk of go into the european union that be what we state in our response to the windsor framework endorse unanimously by all our party officer we make clear what we want and have go far even than that response in remove the green lane from the new arrangement this be progress do it give we everything we want it do not my hon friend the member for north antrim ian paisley have be assiduous in his pursuit of solution on veterinary medicine he have work with the government and campaign alongside representative of the northern ireland agrifood sector as result of that work in the command paper we now have clarity on the position of the uk government in the absence of an agreement with the european union that maintain northern ireland full access to uk veterinary medicine the uk government will legislate to protect our access to veterinary medicine in the united kingdom that be commitment give by the government and commend my hon friend for his work that be the business we be in it be unfinished business we will continue to work to ensure the government deliver on their commitment in the command paper on veterinary medicine thank the leader of the party for his comment this be crucial it affect every single person in northern ireland because it be about food security across the whole of the united kingdom the northern ireland food industry feed about million people not only in northern ireland but across the united kingdom and the world it be vital to our food security damage it as be happen under the previous agreement be wholly destructive to food health and farming also welcome paragraph which address the movement of cattle and livestock that be significant for our farming industry agree that more need to be do and will hold the secretary of state to account to get that legislation on the statute book if europe do not move need add nothing to the point make by my hon friend we welcome the explicit reference in the command paper to northern ireland part in the economy of the united kingdom include the fact that we be within the custom territory of the united kingdom we be part of the uk internal market and it be important that that be maintain may put it on record that think the right hon gentleman have do lot of good work over the past couple of week and he have be very brave it be not easy for member to face down people in their own constituency and it be important that he do may also put it on record that the social democratic and labour party do not support the command paper we think it have move far beyond the principle set out in the good friday agreement it undermine north south co operation and have far too much focus on east west co operation move on from that point we need to ensure that any future negotiation be do with all party and both government so that everybody can feel comfortable in the result the hon member have make his point with fortitude and determination but he will understand that make no apology as unionist for have focus on protect preserve strengthen and bind together our united kingdom of which northern ireland be proud part today be an important moment for we as unionists the strengthening of our constitutional position within the united kingdom be important because our primary focus have be on the protection of the union in that context welcome and draw attention to annex paragraph of the command paper publish yesterday northern ireland place in the economic union remain the single most important factor in ensure its prosperity that be the economic union of the united kingdom we sell more good to great britain than anywhere else in the world and we want to maintain our ability to trade freely within our own country these new arrangement guarantee our unfettered access to the internal market of the united kingdom not just now but in all scenario in the future the safeguard build into these arrangement will protect our place in the economic union of the united kingdom echo the right hon gentleman sentiment about paragraph in annex want to comment on the good will and character through these last month that have be essential to achieve this progress and these gain do he agree with that the polling reference by the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson be not as important as the stamp of approval from this house that come through good debate and scrutiny thank the hon member for his intervention his continue interest in northern ireland and his work in this place to strengthen and protect our union he make strong point which welcome acknowledge the point make by my right hon friend but do he also accept that in propose new section of the windsor framework constitutional status of northern ireland regulations the government still reserve right in the statute book to introduce law that will interfere with trade in northern ireland urge my right hon friend to read all the proposal if he do he will see that new statutory duty will be introduce that will ensure that in circumstance where there be the risk of divergence the minister in charge of the new policy or law will come to this house and make statement not only inform the house of any potential impact on northern ireland place within the united kingdom internal market but set out the measure that the government must take to ameliorate that situation that be set out clearly in the command paper it be commitment by the government on which we intend to hold they to account go forward it be important that we have means of scrutiny and cut the eu pipeline as we have through the amendment to section of the european union withdrawal act people tell we by the way madam deputy speaker that we would not achieve legal change and yet that amendment to section cut the eu pipeline and end the automatic alignment of northern ireland with eu law that be something this party can take great credit for because we have achieve what none of our detractor have be capable of achieve that offer we the opportunity to influence clearly as we state in our seven test how we might proceed in conclusion on behalf of my party welcome this legislation it be important constitutional legislation that safeguard our place in the united kingdom we will hear later about further change to the law that will protect our place in the uk internal market take together with all the proposal in the command paper believe we have basis for move forward pay tribute to the nationalist and other party who have be patient during the process and to the labour party for its support of the government the secretary of state and the prime minister these be very important constitutional safeguard as we have hear but this si be about much more than the constitution it unlock something much big get back into stormont make northern ireland success and make it work this si be about people public sector pay health charity that be desperate to get move again school agriculture and the economic growth of northern ireland commend this si and believe that it will get the full support of the house with the leave of the house will answer few of the point that have be raise we have hear wide and varied range of contribution on all aspect of the regulation from member across the house in my closing remark wish to take the opportunity to address those point first thank the right hon member for leeds central hilary benn for the way that he have approach everything we have do he ask few question which shall try to answer he talk about these measure and how we will be protect the european single market with this package what these measure also do which be unbelievably important be protect our internal market at the same time interruption know that the right hon gentleman know that but just want to emphasise the point because it be important he ask for an example think that it be in propose new section introduce through the regulation of where there would be significant adverse effect can refer he well to the example give of the animal welfare livestock exports bill where there be an obvious advantage to northern ireland to be different which we take on board he very kindly show some ankle on labour position on our future relationship with the eu can beg he to continue to do that while we all enjoy good political debate will not go too far into this point because we be in consensual place we would very much like to explore exactly what labour position be on european union free movement and whole host of other thing the right hon member make reference to the fact that within the legislation there be now safeguard around significant disadvantage towards northern ireland and significant adverse effect do he not agree though that the significant adverse effect be very subjective it have no concrete definition and section allow the minister to go ahead anyway even if it do cause significant adverse effect thank the hon lady for her question before answer it may say that owe she an apology because completely misheard her question yesterday be have trouble hear she think it might be my age but hopefully it be the microphone so want to apologise for not answer her question properly disagree with she and think write ministerial statement allow this place to scrutinise what the minister be do and to allow more transparency also wish to make point hope that will not punch bruise here about the intervention of the hon member for north antrim ian paisley on the right hon member for leeds central the hon member for north antrim say that tariff between gb and northern ireland would be acceptable if they be the will of the parliament disagree think tariff on bushmills would not be that great none the less all of the arrangement in the framework be give full effect by the will of this parliament and so by his definition it must be completely acceptable thank he for his support question put and agree to resolve that the draft windsor framework constitutional status of northern ireland regulations which be lay before this house on january be approve united kingdom internal market beg to move that the draft windsor framework uk internal market and unfettered access regulations which be lay before this house on january be approve it be the view of the government and believe of the overwhelming number of right hon and hon member across the house that the union ought not be reduce to matter of the law or the constitution alone ours be thriving economic cultural and political union whose health be insure in no small part by the free flow of trade across it enhance that economic aspect of the union be the purpose of this second set of regulation before the house today the view of business and trader on the progress that we have make be also important in the context of today debate be pleased to confirm that the early reaction from business have be promise the view of collaboration of key northern ireland industry body be clear yesterday in say that they welcome the agreement the government be clear that the old protocol create unacceptable barrier within our internal market and invite anyone to consider the full implementation of the old protocol against what we have achieve in the windsor framework the windsor framework take major step forward and acknowledge that this be first and foremost an achievement of the democratic unionist party and also great achievement of my right hon friend the secretary of state the framework restore the functioning of the uk internal market by ensure the smooth flow of trade within the uk and disapplie range of eu law include ensure that northern ireland benefit from the same vat and alcohol taxis as the rest of the uk member of the house can also be encourage by the smooth functioning of the framework since october when the first phase of arrangement come on stream support trade between great britain and northern ireland should just say that colleague do ask how it be go say have you see any news on it of course no one have it have be go very well and want to thank and congratulate all those official here and in northern ireland who have make that possible these regulation go far in that aim to strengthen our uk internal market now and in the long term follow the agreement of the windsor framework the border target operating model set out that we will begin phase in check and control for irish good and non qualify good move from the island of ireland to great britain from january indeed from yesterday this be powerful demonstration of northern ireland integral place in the uk internal market and it rebut incorrect claim that it be instead member of the eu single market the reality be that third country member of the eu single market will now have full third country process apply while northern ireland business will have full unfettered access to their most important market in great britain the minister be absolutely right perhaps the most powerful illustration of the change that we have secure be to consider what will happen now on the ferry route between dublin and holyhead as result of these new arrangement northern ireland haulier use that service will board the ferry travel to holyhead leave the ferry and travel straight out of the port and on to their destination with no customs procedure and with full unfettered access in contrast southern irish haulier arrive at holyhead will be subject to full uk custom procedure at the port before they can proceed do he join in welcome northern ireland restoration fully within the uk internal market yes the right hon gentleman be absolutely right in what he have just set out and do join he in that it be proud day for as it be for he and join other members in congratulate he on his courage in bring all of we this far as result of these regulation we now have guarantee for northern ireland good move to the rest of the uk via dublin this unfettered access be future proof regardless of how rule evolve in either northern ireland or great britain these regulation will more squarely focus the benefit of unfettered access on northern ireland trader the regulation tackle avoidance of the rule and ensure that for agri food good to benefit from unfettered access in avoid sanitary and phytosanitary process they must be dispatch from registered northern ireland food and feed operator we will also expressly affirm through these regulation that export procedure will not be apply to good move from northern ireland to other part of the uk internal market it have be say that maybe of good move from gb to ni will be able to use the internal market lane why will not be able to do so and why would the uk government who be tell be in charge not want to ensure that practically all good use the internal market lane with great respect to my right hon friend with whom have go very long way in this cause he might like to revisit the text the point be that the of good go on that route be stay in northern ireland they be uk good the other be good that be go on to the european union that be the point be uk internal market trade and be trade go on to the european union rise will the minister give way will can not say that be astonish this be the important moment do the minister accept that all the statistic show that it be not true that of the trade that go through northern ireland go to the irish republic in fact it be about to much of that trade which will go through the red lane consist of good go into northern ireland either to warehouse or to manufacturer in northern ireland they might never go near the irish republic they might stay in northern ireland go back to gb or go to the rest of the world yet such product will still be subject to check go into northern ireland would not accept that be not in position to set out the statistic and do not doubt that the statistic need some work apply to they it pain to say this as have always regard the right hon gentleman as great friend he and have walk long way together on this and have always regard he as an ideological bedfellow both on the union and on brexit but as his group leader the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson say early we vote for and fervently support the protocol bill we say that we be willing to have red lane in order to safeguard the legitimate interest of our friend and partner and family member as the irish ambassador martin fraser say this be always family dispute and we be always go to get through it our friend in ireland and indeed in the eu have legitimate interest which we should have the humility to respect even if we have act unilaterally as single unite parliament ride roughshod over any international negotiation and just do what suit ourselves with the protocol bill we would have implement the red lane be afraid that will part company now with anyone who say otherwise we would rightly have implement the red lane even act unilaterally out of respect for the legitimate interest of our friend and trading partner will the minister join in welcome the announcement on tuesday of agreement on joint legal text that will significantly change the status of good come from the rest of the world into great britain and travel on to northern ireland the effect of that change which be part of the arrangement and the publish command paper will be that some million good movement between great britain and northern ireland will now be move out of the red lane and into the uk internal market system that be this party delivering and secure real change that ensure that more good flow freely between great britain and northern ireland save for those go into the eu or that be at risk of do so because they be part of manufacturing process for good be sell to the eu strongly welcome that intervention think that the right hon gentleman be go to mention the draft joint agreement on tariff rate quota for while be concern that trqs need to be apply to northern ireland so that northern ireland could share fully in the benefit of free trade agreement with the rest of the world hope to return to this later but in case do not have the opportunity to do so want to say what an extraordinary situation northern ireland be now in northern ireland be not in the single market draw everyone attention to page of the command paper which set out checkmark compare northern ireland with ireland as member of the eu and with norway which be member of the single market through the european economic area but be not in the custom union or the european union northern ireland really have the minimum of eu law compatible with unfettered or privilege perhaps good access to the eu market and consistent with have an open structure free border wonder at people who think that we could leave the european union and establish hard border or do absolutely nothing about the border we be always go to leave the european union and have special arrangement in relation to northern ireland this be moment of great feeling for because before the referendum vote and other colleague set up committee of eurosceptics to consider how we might deal with these issue confess that we do not have the sps and custom expertise to proceed that then become the great story of this battle if the united kingdom have unite in accept the result of the referendum if this parliament have unite in go forward with resolve to further our own interest as an independent nation state outside the eu but crucially with the humility to respect the legitimate interest of our friend and partner and if from the beginning we have have unite resolve and clarity of vision do not doubt that in spirit of friendship and good will the kind that exist today between ireland and we and between the european union and we thank to the work of the secretary of state the prime minister and other we would have be as we be now in totally transform position to make our way forward as friend respectful of their interest and resolve on our that be not what happen the house do not need to rehearse it it have take eight year of drama for we to arrive at this moment when we have reduce eu law to this extent and put in place red lane to protect the legitimate interest of ireland and the eu that be something that we should all be very proud of after everything that we have face and all the risk that could have put we in far bad position totally understand the need for red lane to ensure that good go into the republic of ireland be check but there be business in northern ireland of whose sale be into northern ireland the stuff all come to it in one container maybe of that load might make its way into the irish republic as part of service agreement with another dealer be talk about major firm in my constituency that have an all ireland approach that mean that the red lane apply to every single item even though of its stuff be use in northern ireland scotland or england it be main distributor and it will end up have to put all its good through that job of work might need to be do to try to ameliorate its problem the hon gentleman be right that job of work will need to be do assure he that my right hon friend the secretary of state have just say that of course it do be grateful that we will be do that further work in spirit of good will and co operation through the joint committee with the european union if the hon gentleman drop an email to my northern ireland office address shall be glad to visit the firm with he bring official and we will see whether we can move far to assist it need to find out more about its exact circumstance my goodness that be long series of intervention this legislation ensure that we can avoid any unnecessary gold plat in the implementation of new arrangement through new statutory guidance on section of the united kingdom internal market act set out how public authority should have special regard to northern ireland place in the uk internal market and custom territory and the need to maintain the free flow of good from ni to gb we will take power through the regulation to issue such statutory guidance and public authority will be require to have regard to it those change to the law will help to ensure that public authority take every proper effort to prevent new barrier to intra uk trade in do so they will maintain and strengthen the health of the uk internal market in the long term one issue that greatly vex those in my party be that farmer in my constituency and in other have say that vet now cost even more as they have to source medicine and device from an acceptable source the command paper suggest that the issue have not be resolve but will be work on be that firm demand on the government or be it just another work group that will talk about thing my hon friend the member for north antrim ian paisley have be at the fore on this we need person on that committee to push thing forward if we have solution through the committee we need timescale for delivery we understand that point and we be listen to the hon gentleman and other we be resolute that of course northern ireland must have proper access to veterinary medicine and will be glad to work with he and other he will appreciate what the priority be and have be and we will certainly continue to make pursue veterinary medicine high priority be personally resolute on the issue and look forward to pursue it the regulation must be see in the context of the overall package agree between the government and the dup the passage of these regulation demonstrate the government commitment to take forward that whole package and to maintain the participation and trust of the whole community in northern ireland political process and the stormont institution go forward if may touch on what the hon member for foyle colum eastwood say early my right hon friend the secretary of state and the whole government be completely committed to the belfast good friday agreement in all its dimension as say to one nationalist politician about year ago now if recall it be perfectly possible to be unionist and support the belfast good friday agreement in all its dimension just as it be possible to be nationalist or republican and support the belfast good friday agreement in all its dimension it be the beauty and the triumph of the agreement that we can all support it and move forward be try to say this as gently as possible can understand degree of discomfort from the hon gentleman because this be big breakthrough for unionism unionist conservative government have agree to do unionist thing with the democratic unionist party and that be something be very proud of however that do not in any way diminish our impartiality or our commitment to govern or see to the government of northern ireland in proper manner rise before give way to the hon gentleman may just say that think after the experience of the last eight year perhaps the last need defer to no one in my vociferous commitment to democratic self determination the minister say he support the good friday agreement in all its part do he support the bit that say that the government should be rigorously impartial yes do not quite hear the comment from the leader of the dup not on the union it have long be say that this be the conservative and unionist party and we have long be understand to be unionist party this agreement be entirely consistent with both our unionism and our full respect for all dimension of the belfast good friday agreement we will continue to govern in spirit of good will and impartiality will my hon friend give way will but after have give way to my right hon and learn friend will make progress and finish so that other colleague can have their say have listen carefully to the intervention from the hon member for foyle colum eastwood and the concern that he and other will have about the scrapping of the legal obligation with regard to the all island economy be the point not that while as uk government we have to uphold the rule that apply within our united kingdom and the promotion of our own internal market that do not detract from the access to the single market that northern ireland business will continue to enjoy that be the compromise that have be reach here therefore there be not binary either or choice the hon gentleman concern can largely be meet and continue to be meet in way that be fully in accordance with the good friday belfast agreement agree with my right hon and learn friend who demonstrate his expertise look forward as much as anyone to the re establishment of the assembly and the executive and along with that the re establishment of the north south institution they be much need and look forward to their work do not mind admit that find myself able to work constructively with politician of all political party in northern ireland and be glad to do so let return in concluding to what be at stake in this process firmly believe that all party in this house and all party eligible to form part of an executive want northern ireland to work have see what unite political leader in northern ireland real determination to make life well for their constituent and my goodness on wide range of front that be necessary and to allow northern ireland to grasp the opportunity of the future and what opportunity they be elaborate on some of the thing northern ireland have before it right now if we combine the institutional arrangement before northern ireland with the very substantial financial package to transform public service and deal with the public finance and if northern irish politician reach out and grasp the opportunity now before they they can make northern ireland beacon to the world beacon of prosperity and hope of reconciliation these regulation be part of that process and commend they to everyone in the house call the shadow secretary of state begin by agree with the minister that business in northern ireland want to make the current and future arrangement work that they want they to work well and that there be huge potential for the people of northern ireland in the economic benefit that its current and future circumstance provide it have some specific point about the regulation see the minister clearly relish respond to those paragraph of the command paper state we be now change arrangement to ensure that check be eliminate save for those conduct by uk authority need for the protection of the uk internal market on risk and intelligence basis will the minister clarify which check on good move from great britain to northern ireland will be get rid of be he refer to identity check check on paperwork or something else at the moment about of good use what be call the green lane which will become the uk internal market lane be subject to some check on paperwork will he clarify what will happen to they welcome the amendment to the uk internal market act provide for in regulation propose new section would reaffirm northern ireland unfettered access to the rest of the internal market and ensure that no new ni gb check can be introduce the regulation also make provision for the secretary of state to issue guidance to departments on how they should carry out their duty under section of the act namely ensure that they have special regard to among other thing northern ireland status in the uk internal market when they formulate policy will the minister confirm that guidance will soon be forthcoming and share any further detail he can at this stage about what that will contain note the change to the definition of qualifying northern ireland goods eu exit regulations make by regulation which be intend to prevent northern ireland from be use as back door for eu good move into gb and to protect northern ireland agricultural sector ensure that ni register agrifood operator fully benefit from unfettered access be very positive step and welcome it will the minister tell the house whether the government envisage any further change to the definition of qualify northern ireland good also note the government confirmation in the command paper that there will be no border control post at cairnryan that be greatly to be welcome but can the minister say anything far about how check and formality on non qualify good that enter gb from northern ireland through cairnryan will work in practice let turn to some of the other commitment set out in the command paper will the minister confirm when he expect the new body announce to promote trade within the uk intertrade uk to become operational and how it will be oversee welcome the government determination which have be bring up by number of member to ensure the continue supply of veterinary medicine into northern ireland beyond the end of when the current grace period expire we all hope that an agreement can be reach with our european partner as soon as possible share the view express by other in the debate that we have the same problem with human medicine and in the end the eu recognise that something have to be do about that hope very much that the eu will show the same spirit in approach this question the command paper however say we will if necessary deploy all available flexibility to safeguard and sustain the supply of veterinary medicine will the minister tell the house what those flexibility be and how they will be apply if we get to that point in approve the regulation which hope we will do unanimously as we just do with the constitutional set we will be take another step close in this really important week to the restoration of power sharing the people of northern ireland who have be without government for so long may not in all fairness be study the regulation in the way that we be do today but they very clearly understand why they be essential to get their government back once we have do our bit today it will be over to the politician of northern ireland and be sure that every single member of the house wish they the very good in the task that lie ahead of they the important statutory instrument that we be discuss today be the late in the process of implement the result of the referendum to leave the european union they may not have attract the same volume attention or emotion as those endless meaningful vote in and but they be no less important this have be long and difficult process that have divide the nation but the end goal of restore our status as an independent self govern democracy have be prize worth fight for for century member of this parliament strive to ensure that we would be govern only by the law make by our own elect representative and that be what brexit seek to deliver but we all know that the job be not yet finish when it come to northern ireland so pay tribute to the secretary of state the minister and the dup for their work and determination to tackle the problem with the windsor framework and secure northern ireland place in the uk internal market very much welcome the advance be make towards the restoration of power sharing and devolve government and accept that the statutory instrument be an important part of enable that to happen because of the significant change they contain of course completely understand the dup concern regard the northern ireland protocol and the windsor framework we must do all we can to minimise trade friction between britain and northern ireland the agreement on the windsor framework start that process for example by make the movement of medicine food and item for retail sale much less problematic believe that further improvement will be deliver by the deal that we be look at today which will far reduce check and inspection my concern be that the central problem remain that northern ireland be subject to single market rule without have vote on they the instrument we be consider do not change that although welcome the important further clarity and safeguard offer on the stormont brake dialogue with the eu have to continue so that ultimately we can move to situation in which only item destine for export to the south be subject to eu rule and regulation in northern ireland with pragmatism and advance border technology that should be possible it be important that we continue to strive to bring that about so that we can restore democratic control over make our law in every part of our united kingdom and brexit be fully deliver for northern ireland as it be for great britain we also need assurance from ministers that nothing in regulation of the windsor framework constitutional status of northern ireland regulations will prevent regulatory divergence between britain and the eu of course any responsible minister must consider the impact of his or her decision on the unity of the uk and its single market but new screening obligation must not be allow to create chilling effect which would stop we chart our own course with regard to how we regulate our economy take back control of make our own law be key reason that people vote to leave the eu we have yet to fully deliver that for northern ireland and as have say we must go far on it in the future be grateful to the right hon lady for the conversation we have have on this specific point she be right to highlight her concern and to seek assurance from the government but she do accept that it be right to get assessment that it be right that government should always be go through the process of assess the impact of their decision on every part of this united kingdom and that there be nothing wrong with transparency with know any possible consequence nor if that potential consequence be negative with all of we determinedly try to ensure that it do not arise thank the hon gentleman for that intervention the dialogue that he and have have over recent day have do lot to reassure that this package be about transparency not block on divergence hope the minister will confirm that in his closing remark because divergence be important the regulatory reform make possible by exit be think crucial for our future economic success by make we more competitive modernise regulation be key mean to boost growth raise living standard and reduce taxis in conclusion it take courage and determination from northern ireland elect leader to secure peace after three horrific decade of terrorist violence ask very different party to sit in permanent mandatory coalition be never go to be easy not least because some of the division between they date back decade or even century that devolve government have work for so much of the past quarter of century be testament to northern ireland leader and their determination to make the settlement work to make northern ireland work pay particular tribute to the dup in that regard for so often it be they who have find way to fix problem and keep devolve government go while always safeguard unionist principle we in this house must recognise the significant problem cause by the northern ireland protocol and the windsor framework include of course what the court have describe as subjugation of article of the act of union of but as we have hear today we be make real progress on tackle these issue by set out in the statutory instrument strong legal protection for access to the gb market also think that the historical perspective as set out in annexe of the command paper be something that everyone should read we be make progress on remedy these problem it be privilege for as secretary of state for just under four year to play part in northern ireland inspire story and truly hope that way can now be find for its devolved institution to resume their work of take northern ireland forward to further success and an even bright future rise be try to get an idea of how many member wish to speak some who have indicate that they want to speak be now not stand fine that be very helpful call the snp spokesperson we on the snp benches start from the principle that the few impediment there be to trade between all part of the uk and between the uk and the eu the well that be something that clearly take step backwards with brexit so we very much welcome the fact that the northern ireland situation at least have be largely address by the regulation before we which we will support with that dual market access northern ireland will clearly now enjoy highly advantageous situation relative to other part of the uk and although we very much support this si my hope be that in time the people of england wales and scotland will wish to rediscover that advantageous situation for themselves and ultimately render the content of this si obsolete finally it would be remiss of not to miss the opportunity to tweak the minister tail slightly give that he say he be an enthusiast for democratic self determination so be and look forward to similar stout defence from the minister of that right to democratic self determination in other part of the union in the future it be privilege to speak in the debate and to follow the many hon and right hon member who have speak with great wisdom knowledge and personal experience on these matter it be informative to apply to article of the act of union the four test for impact that be develop by justice colton specifically northern ireland compliance with certain eu standard the bureaucracy and associate cost of comply with custom documentation and check the payment of tariff for good at risk and the unfettered access enjoy by northern ireland business to the eu single market question the representation of the supreme court judgment as set out in paragraph of annex to the command paper but those be matter for the last debate and there be not time to make my point the windsor framework remove many eu standard for gb produce consumer good destine for northern ireland that do not change under the si before we the second test on bureaucracy and compliance cost associate with custom should concern we as the protocol see the diversion of billion worth of good in supply chain from gb to the republic indeed logistic business testify to the lords windsor framework sub committee on the complexity of manage mixed load with two large haulage firm state that groupage have be forget in the framework expert analysis have also suggest that of output in non exempt manufacturing sector include electronic engineering and chemical come from firm with turnover above million which will see their gb supply chain stick in the red lane or divert abroad the command paper publish yesterday contain pledge uk internal market guarantee that no more than of good will flow through the red lane in practice that create monitoring panel to report on any failure to hit the target and make recommendation to which the government must respond that be admirable but do not represent material change to exist custom requirement under the protocol it be also worth note that worryingly that could be achieve simply by divert supply chain away from gb towards the eu as affect gb business cut northern ireland out of their distribution chain the regulation before we create important easement for northern ireland to gb trade include guarantee that future divergence will not impact the ability of northern ireland trader to freely access gb market that be welcome but the bulk of distribution have always pertain to gb to ni trade not the reverse as be also note in the command paper although technology may ease compliance cost in the medium to long term those cost will still exist ship from london to belfast will continue to require significantly more bureaucracy than ship to york or edinburgh the third test on tariff be not cover and do not apply finally let turn to northern ireland preferential access to the eu single market must emphasise that the clear trade off that we have choose to give northern ireland unregulate access to eu supply chain come at the cost of complicate access to gb one despite the fact that northern ireland import from gb be two and half time those from the eu and six time those from ireland whatever easement we offer that have create custom judicial and legislative border across the kingdom and it be hurt our business the fact that northern ireland continue to have preferential access to the eu single market be unarguable but it should not be misunderstood again find that final test informative nothing say today be intend to diminish the achievement of the deal when it come to material gain for northern ireland although welcome the element within the new deal which undoubtedly offer increase safeguard for the union it do not change the fact of eu law application to northern ireland additional bureaucracy for gb business attempt to access northern ireland the existence of tariff or northern ireland de facto placement within the eu single market once again the quality and effectiveness of this deal will emerge over the month and year ahead be sure and through the scrutiny that must come from this place will continue to offer my support in those month and year ahead will the hon member give way order believe the hon gentleman have finish his speech call gavin robinson thank you madam deputy speaker would be very happy to let my colleague in if she wish to respond to the hon member for aberconwy robin millar think it need to be reiterate that if the people of england wales or scotland wake up tomorrow morning and find that they would have to stand for election to try to stop law in area be impose on they by foreign parliament it would be outrageous and see as outrageous by this house that point should not be lose on this gathering be glad that allow my hon friend to make that intervention even though the hon member for aberconwy have bring his contribution to conclusion because that be an important point in the context of the uk parliament be proud to stand in support of the si before we and to recognise the effort over the past number of year to deal with what be impose on we and the people of northern ireland by colleague in this chamber and by government arise from the arrangement reach in the withdrawal agreement and the northern ireland protocol series of measure be take design to encourage those who do not overly concern themselves with the position in which they have leave northern ireland to redress the harm do today be in many way culmination of part of that process but not an end to it for the past number of year my colleague and have stand firm in this regard we have take principled position about the imposition of the northern ireland protocol and the harm it have cause our country and our place within our country and have work determinedly for solution on the damage do and the diversion of trade between northern ireland and the republic of ireland many supplier have find that it be easy to get product from the republic of ireland because uk supplier be feed up with the bureaucracy they be encounter job of work need to be do with uk supplier to ensure they can bring back that trade my hon friend be absolutely right intertrade uk body about which member will read in the command paper will have an important job of work to do in that regard back in october whenever we be under significant pressure to move and to accept our lot my parliamentary predecessor former first minister of northern ireland and my mentor peter robinson issue powerful post remind colleague and those of we who be under pressure that we have not come this far only to come this far he be encourage we to stand and we stand our ground not only then but throughout all the hype and all the pressure associate with the publication of the windsor framework the three fundamental that be expand on in our seven test be to repair the constitutional harm impose upon our country to remove the democratic deficit at the heart of the arrangement for parliamentarian in our northern ireland assembly and to reduce the friction on trade and remove it in respect of gb to ni good that be stay in the uk internal market that have be our quest on the constitutional harm be delighted that as consequence of our party resolution determination and stand over the past number of year the leader of my party my right hon friend the member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson and this parliament be able to speak to and agree the constitutional si that just pass the house that be an important milestone on the democratic deficit let we not forget that what have be achieve in repair and remove the democratic deficit and give stormont say in the rule that apply to northern ireland do not just come by way of change in this place the agreement of that resolution require structural amendment to the northern ireland protocol and article and of that protocol be amend the windsor framework do that and in the constitutional si that we just pass we have strengthen far still the legislative provision around the operation of that process say that to indicate that what we be tell could not happen change to these text these tablet of stone have happen these regulation be an important document not in and of themselves but as part of much wide package that have be secure and that be publish in yesterday command paper that wide package have import in and of itself and today proceeding have an importance attach to the prospect of return to devolution our party be devolutionist party we believe in locally elect representative in northern ireland have the ability to shape our future within the united kingdom the cost and consequence of not recognise the opportunity before we of not see the gain that have be achieve would be too damaging for unionism and too damaging for the future of our province within this country neither this si nor the si we have just pass be the sum total of what we have agree listen to the hon member for aberconwy say that there be no issue for good move from northern ireland to great britain he believe that because it have be say so many time but it be not so from successive conservative government have always dismiss the fact that trader trade in both direction and they have always answer through one prism never recognise that we should be equally free to buy and sell in the marketplace say that trade have not be concern be to belie the fact that as unionists within this country we have situation in which uk trade deal do not automatically apply to we in northern ireland consumer in northern ireland could not benefit from those trade deal although it be not in this si it be worth mention that on tuesday evening as consequence of our discussion and negotiation with the government and as publish in the command paper we see the publication of page of legislative text that will see product from the rest of the world that be freely available in the rest of the united kingdom now be available in northern ireland those product will be take from the red lane into the uk internal market system some tonne of product will be available that be not available until we secure the concession that recognise our rightful place within this united kingdom and our access to uk free trade deal that important step mean that million item will move from the red lane into the uk internal market system and it will mean that free trade deal benefit the people of northern ireland in way that they previously could not in way that they do not and in way that be never previously consider that progress have be secure by this agreement the house will also recognise that as outline not in this si but in the deal itself primary legislation will be introduce to remove what can describe only as the legislative litter retain from the joint report on the fictional all ireland economy which do not exist the reason why good be label not for sale in the eu when move from gb to ni be because we have separate and distinct arrangement we be not the same as the rest of the island of ireland we be part of the united kingdom and this deal reinforce that appreciate the hon gentleman concern about the phrase all ireland economy but do he not recognise that number of company base in northern ireland essentially operate on an all ireland basis his party leader the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson have highlight the obvious example of coca cola which be base in lisburn and serve the entire island it be always good to hear from the hon gentleman but he knowingly confuse my point he know that coca cola be situate in northern ireland and send its product throughout the island of ireland be point that recognise our access to the single market with which take no issue see it as practical benefit he also ignore the fact that in northern ireland coca cola be able to manage different tax regime different currency and many different aspect which in and of themselves clearly demonstrate that there be no all ireland economy be not concerned about there be one but be concerned that there be one remain reference in legislation that be totally irrelevant and have no force in effect but require ministers to have due regard to something that do not exist and be part of this agreement the northern ireland protocol bill accept red and green lane but under this new arrangement there be no need for lane to deal with good come from gb to ni and stay within the united kingdom internal market the check require by the windsor framework taper down to by but in real term on some fruit and veg on meat fish and poultry and on dairy be go save for the ordinary check we have in relation to smuggling and criminality those change can only be achieve by open the eu text and secure change in way that we be tell could not happen that we be tell be mythical or wishful thinking madam deputy speaker you have be very gracious in let speak around the si up until this point in the united kingdom internal market act the government propose many thing that be to be of benefit to we but they drop they they have our support in protect our place within the uk internal market but they drop the proposal this deal bring they back again but it also go far other members have comment on this but propose new section of the act say accordingly this act prohibit the application of export procedure to good remove from northern ireland to great britain whether or not member think it have practical import can say as unionist that it have principle import there should be no exit procedure the exit procedure under the northern ireland protocol have cause we so much harm and they have go that be important for all of we subsection say in particular that permanent unfettered access be achieve in relation to qualify northern ireland good through among other thing the mutual recognition mutual recognition have be discuss many time in this house and it be an aspiration we all share we be tell it be mythical we be tell it be unicorn project we be tell that it could never be achieve because the eu would never agree yet in this si we have mutual recognition something that could do away with the check the impediment and the imposition that be put upon we by this parliament and resolve the barrier to trade within our own country something that have consequence for the principled and political integrity of our country be now go because we have achieve mutual recognition why be that important it be important in the context of the debate we have be have across the house be proud that we have put in measure about internal market impact assessment that probably seem little boring methodical and bureaucratic but even if we go through the process of get civil servant and maker to understand that any choice they make could have an impact on the uk internal market and northern ireland place within it to understand what those impact be and seek to address they and even if the conclusion be that parliamentary sovereignty reign and the principal policymaker in this place decide that they will diverge in policy term from where we be in northern ireland we have good guarantee nobody on the dup benches be go to upset parliamentary sovereignty but we will protect our place within this united kingdom the good guarantee the mutual recognition that say that irrespective of the standard that apply in either part of this country our good from northern ireland will always be welcome in the rest of the united kingdom be gain it be gain even when other do not see it as problem because it future proof our place within this united kingdom it be something that be absent from the windsor framework it have be long quest for all of those who have walk hard yard to resolve some of the issue that have arise from our choice to leave the european union but our determination on those issue have never waver and resolution have be achieve new section of the united kingdom internal market act deal with indirect access in that section our government be now say very clearly that there can be no administrative check control and process not only for direct movement between one part of our country and another but for indirect movement direct movement but for the fact that the good have merely pass through the republic of ireland that crystallise yet again the fact that we be not in an all ireland economy we be different from our near neighbour legislatively northern ireland haulier and northern ireland business that be send good from northern ireland to great britain will be able to do so in an unfettered way even if they travel through foreign country those control will not apply to they those achievement be worth focus on because we have be try to resolve the unresolvable to get focus on place where attention have move elsewhere it have take much long than we would have like be sure that many member on other benches would have prefer the process to end lot soon as well if only we have agree to less but we be not prepared to do so the windsor framework mark progress but we say that there be unresolved issue not only the potential for future divergence in gb that would put we in difficult position or gain that be offer in the northern ireland protocol bill or indeed the united kingdom internal market act that be ultimately drop which we have now bring back and secure and this parliament be agree to but resolve the unresolvable in way that will have practical application for northern ireland and for our place within this united kingdom now and for long time to come have

department of finance in the northern ireland executive to look at the competitiveness of northern ireland corporation tax and that give northern ireland an additional opportunity to maximise its

there be two speaker leave and suggest they speak for nine minute each it be pleasure to speak in this debate and will adhere as always do to your timescale madam deputy speaker know my right hon friend the member for east antrim sammy wilson have lot to say as well the combined year of negotiation have to be recognise there have be movement and even the harsh critic must be fair and admit to the huge step that have be take it be right and proper that thank those in the dup notably my leader my right hon friend the member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson and deputy leader my hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson sit on the right and leave of here in this chamber also thank the other who have contribute such as the secretary of state and other with influence the right hon member for skipton and ripon julian smith have be great advocate for unionism in northern ireland and we thank he for that so be grateful to all who have do the bulk of the work by tirelessly advocate for change they have secure deal and be thankful for that however must be clear this be not the fulfilment of wish list it do not go as far as would wish and would like to see more but how can change that change that from in this house change it in this westminster house of commons that be how we do it as democrat that be how believe we must do it that be point worth make be an active constituency mp as we all be be not say that no other member be and have travel the length and breadth of my constituency discuss this matter meet with orange brother and sister in january this year and do the same last year meet with teacher nhs worker individual and community group take time on the doorstep to explain to my people why we have to take the necessary step of bring down stormont to try to provide the justification for stay out of stormont at time when money be be withhold and every threat other than physical be be lodge at we take the time to attempt to tell people that it be not matter of we be thran to use an ulster scotsism but it be matter of we take seriously the economic and constitutional position of northern ireland within the union that be what my colleague have do for two year and have stand firm on this and on the seven test that the dup outline now today we see the legislation that and other call for constitutional legislation to secure our place within the internal market and retain some level of concern and press the government for more assurance minister would expect to do that it be highlight yesterday that the european law may be overrule by government but the wording suggest that they may also be accept allow northern ireland to diverge all the people represent seek an assurance from our government that this deal and the legislation before this house will do exactly what it say on the tin and secure our place in the internal market in fact restore and then secure our place say gently to my colleague on the treasury bench and across the chamber that there be lack of trust which boil down to the treatment of unionists by rule government in this house for decade the secretary of state kindly take that on board when raise it in an intervention look forward to that trust be build upon in way that enable we to secure the trust of the people be privileged to represent in this house the irish government have no issue with support call for reunification yet our government ministers have be afraid to appear unbiased government need to be unbiased the opinion of this house on our sovereignty should be clear my party leader seek not simply to secure legislation and change for this to take place now but to future proof it in other word we be not just deal with it for today we be deal with it for the future of my child and grandchild and those probably will not be here for many of the people represent have state their lack of trust in government who tell we they have give we the good they could and then do not deliver my hon friend make powerful point about trust the way the people of northern ireland have be treat over the past number of year by this government be terrible we need only look at the abortion law that be force on the people of northern ireland and the relationship and sexuality education change bring into northern ireland so trust be at an all time low and there be people in my constituency who look at this not through rose tint glass but with the view that we need to go much far and do more my hon friend clearly illustrate the distrust to be fair the minister of state and secretary of state have recognise that and know the job they have to do it be clear why some of my electorate question not the dealing of the dup but rather those of the government wonder whether this deal be deliverable and will stand the test of time under the methodology before we the government must take step and only when they take that step can we then make an assessment of whether the deal be deliverable and will stand the test of time that be what the issue boil down to and it be why express concern there be huge lack of trust and that have spill over to many be unable to accept the spirit of the deal and in all honesty say this respectfully fully understand the distrust just to give the house one quick example on tuesday morning have the opportunity to look over the deal gentleman have be in touch not just with but with my hon friend on these benches he say jim go to test this out to see if the paperwork be less that be tuesday morning he come back to tuesday night and he send text today which think other may have have to say that for the product that have each need page of paperwork the paperwork be away he also tell that the pet food that he could not get he will be able to get in three week time that have to be progress why do that happen it happen because of some of the thing that have be do here take the opportunity to speak to business and to the farmer farmer and their union have tell that as far as they be concern they see progress on machinery tractor and vehicle in an intervention on the minister early mention the importance of have veterinary committee make plug for my hon friend the member for north antrim ian paisley to be member of that because his influence in that area will be critical he have do the spadework and he seem to to be the right man to be in there to fight for we my electorate want their representative back to stormont but not at any price rather than the spirit of chamberlain peace at any price which embolden our enemy they hold to the mantra of churchill that we will fight they on the beach and how true that be we have seek to secure the internal market but read the si make it clear that lot of interpretation be in the hand of the sit government my constituent be desperate to get the billion that have be wilfully withhold say that with great respect to the secretary of state last week those await treatment on the nhs list deserve funding to reduce their time in pain the bus driver stand few yard down from my constituency office in the freezing cold deserve pay raise the child with special need deserve the security of know that their day centre will remain open and not close due to insufficient funding all those people deserve those thing whether or not this deal be strike but we also deserve the truth of who we be in the light of the legislation be we casual will finish soon madam deputy speaker be rush quickly to meet your timing be we casual member of the uk with the eu to have continue say on law and the recognition of status or do we have full uk membership with the benefit and security of every other part of the uk the deal have be hard fight for and seek to address that but the real power to assure we lie in this house with the ministers and the government at home people be urge we to keep our word and agree we must but we can do so only if the government in this place also keep their word northern ireland deserve our place in the uk and my party leadership have fight hard for it the question be simple and so be the answer seek be we british in law in economic and in parity or be we not speak the word today and ensure that my government and ministers here keep it tomorrow will bring in the minister no later than pm will not go over the wide range of what be in the command paper or the si but will focus on some particular point in the si it be well know that do not support this deal or agreement and have give reason why not it be important that we have the opportunity to examine the detail of it and the way that this legislation have be hurry through today have not allow that examination that be one reason why will focus just on one particular aspect of it when my hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson be speak he talk about the need to get rid of the debris or litter that be still around the first point want to make perhaps the minister can answer this in sum up be that lot of legislative litter be still around as result of the arrangement put in place for the red lane and the green lane we have statutory instrument on which have speak in committee on number of occasion and eu regulation include regulation which give the eu the right to make the final decision to suspend good go through the green lane and suspect the internal market lane and make the red lane the default position wonder when we will see the removal of all the infrastructure around the previous arrangement in the protocol and the windsor framework that would indicate that the uk government be totally in command of good flow into northern ireland rather than as the eu legislation and indeed the withdrawal agreement state at present the eu have the final say secondly my hon friend indicate that the movement of good between northern ireland and gb be an issue of concern it be and indeed it be likely to be an issue of concern in the future especially since the windsor framework constitutional status of northern ireland regulations make it clear that legislation could be introduce in the house that would impact on trade between northern ireland and gb for example if the government decide to change some retain eu law the only assurance give be that minister would have to make an assessment of the impact and report it to the house but at the end of the day this be clear in propose new section of the european union withdrawal act he could make decision to proceed nevertheless even though that would likely have an impact on trade eu law could be another reason for divergence we could find decision make or practice allow in the eu that put the gb market at risk that be why we will be introduce the border operating model the danger be that northern ireland good could get catch in that imagine hear people include the minister say but the legislation prevent that it do on the face of it we can not have any border check for what be call northern ireland qualify good go into gb indeed local authority will be inform that trade can not be restrict that no barrier can be put up to that trade and that northern ireland qualify good should have free access of course all the export declaration previously require be to be drop however perhaps the minister can tell we what be mean in propose new section of the uk internal market act which indicate that if good fall into one of five category they will require export declaration leave that aside let we look at the situation actually it be provide for in this legislation whereby it be quite clear that the freedom give for northern ireland qualify good to sail through into gb be be abuse by exporter from the republic who bring good through northern ireland and declare they as qualify good by the way it appear that no evidence have to be give it will simply be take on trust when good be declare to be qualify good see the minister be nod indicate dissent perhaps the minister can tell we what proof company will have to give and how onerous that proof will be what will happen where it become clear that there be abuse in good move through northern ireland into gb it appear again if be misread this perhaps the minister can explain it to that propose new section indicate that guidance will be give to local authority probably through body and so on as to what need to be do to keep the free flow of good between northern ireland and gb but propose new section state the secretary of state may revise or revoke in whole or in part any guidance issue under this section in what circumstance would that guidance be give if it be give what would the impact be on the free flow of good from northern ireland to gb which be more than of our market it be about those detail when we have this kind of seal of an agreement with all the wide range and broad brush aspect we sometimes find that when we get down to the detail it fall apart as happen in the windsor framework let we not forget that it fall apart within about two day of the prime minister give the assurance it be important that we understand all the various scenario that be be paint in such detailed si as this first will the minister give we an assurance about what be happen to the green lane infrastructure will the si and the eu regulation be remove or will they stay in place as part of the windsor framework the protocol and the withdrawal agreement secondly what be the five category of good that will require export declaration people need to know thirdly when it come to the good flow into gb under what circumstance will the border operating model be apply to they the final point want to make be this will the right hon member give way only have one minute leave we be tell in paragraph of the command paper that for good go through the green lane some declaration of standard commercial information will be require perhaps the minister could tell we what standard commercial information company will be continue to be require to supply even under the agreement time be short but will do my level well to answer as many question as can it have be very interesting debate the right hon member for leeds central hilary benn ask which check will be eliminate the change will apply both for identity or visual check and for physical check we will take power shortly to make direction to the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs to ensure that be the case on the change to the definition of qualify northern ireland good we will require they to have genuine connection to northern ireland and not to be merely cross through the si require qualify northern ireland good to be dispatch from ni register food business operator it concentrate competitive advantage on northern ireland firm we will continue to engage closely with northern ireland business on future change and will always be responsive if arrangement need to be improve theme that can safely say run throughout everything the government will do the right hon gentleman ask when we will introduce guidance on section of the uk internal market act we will work rapidly to deliver on every aspect of the deal announce yesterday guidance on section will be prepare as quickly as possible certainly hear he on that point and he will continue to press we the guidance will be help to avoid unnecessary gold plating the right hon gentleman ask about cairnryan eu good arrive there will be check in line with the border target operating model but can confirm there will be no border control post at cairnryan we be work through the option and will work closely with the devolved government include the newly restore executive to achieve our share objective the right hon gentleman ask about flexibility for veterinary medicine we be commit to explore flexibility that can be deploy where they be consistent with international law to guarantee the supply of veterinary medicine in northern ireland we will establish veterinary medicine working group to identify possibility in this policy area but be not in position to set out those flexibility now however as we have all put so much effort into reset the relationship with the european union hope and expect that we will be able to succeed in negotiation my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers the former secretary of state make powerful case that brexit must be fully deliver with which agree reassure she that nothing in this deal will prevent we from diverge for the record there be no commitment of any kind as part of this deal to align great britain with eu law to prevent great britain from diverge from any retain eu law or to increase alignment in northern ireland beyond the strictly limited scope that parliament have approve which be itself subject to democratic consent and safeguard for the avoidance of doubt there be no legal mechanism to prevent divergence or force alignment across the whole of the uk minister retain full freedom to diverge from retain eu law both side of the argument have express concern in this debate want to draw the house attention to paragraph of the command paper internal market assessments will be publicly available so this change will enable parliament and the ni assembly to more readily have the information they need for their scrutiny function these step will fundamentally rewire structure within the government to ensure full consideration of the potential northern ireland impact of any measure ensure that the internal market be integral to policy development of course we will continue to work with all party on outstanding issue will the minister give way be extremely short of time but out of respect will give way will the minister admit to the bottom line as contain in propose new section of the european union withdrawal act set out in the draft windsor framework constitutional status of northern ireland regulations which require statement to the effect that the minister be unable to make such statement that is that the bill in question will not affect trade between northern ireland and gb but his majesty government nevertheless wish the house to proceed with the bill the bottom line be yes divergence can happen and trade can be disrupt readily concede that there can be change to retain eu law and that divergence can happen but we have set out the safeguard at some length also encourage the right hon gentleman as my right hon friend the member for skipton and ripon julian smith who make an excellent speech say and as indeed the right hon member for leeds central hilary benn say to look at the section of the command paper in relation to the act of union myself learn great deal about it will the minister give way need to finish in one minute but will give way very briefly draw the minister attention to paragraph of the command paper which make it very clear that where primary legislation carry implication for the internal market the government will set out the measure they propose to take to protect northern ireland place in the internal market be grateful to the right hon gentleman for that intervention yes that be the position in closing there be sensitivity on all side as we have hear over the course of the debate but real life in the age of intervention be complex and we will press on as well we can with that believe this government have keep to the timetable as we agree very much hope we will be able to look forward now to restore executive one we will be very pleased to support in serve the good interest of all the people of northern ireland question put and agree to resolve that the draft windsor framework uk internal market and unfettered access regulations which be lay before this house on january be approve business of the house ordered at this day sit notwithstanding the provision of paragraph and of standing order no relate to the scheduling of select committee statement select committee statement on the third report of the levelling up housing and communities committee may be make after the conclusion of proceeding on this largan as member may know the backbench business debate on miner and mining community have be postpone to later date we will now move on to the select committee statement on behalf of the levelling up housing and communities committee financial distress in local authorities levelling up housing and communities committee select committee statement order this day mr clive betts the select committee chair will speak for up to minute during which no intervention can be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question about it these should be brief question not speech should also emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair and not to the relevant minister front benchers may take part in questioning it be great pleasure to make this statement on behalf of the levelling up housing and communities committee about its report financial distress in local authority let first thank the leader of the house for table the business motion that have allow the statement to be make our committee clerk be excited about the fact that we have apparently set procedural precedent today be certainly not aware of that but be now let also thank the backbench business committee for originally provide the time for the statement our inquiry look into the extent of the funding gap in local authority finance and some of the main spending challenge that they face social care special educational need and homelessness the report bring attention to key issue ahead of the upcoming local government financial settlement it make recommendation not only for urgent action to resolve the immediate crisis but large reform for the government to consider after the next election everyone recognise that the financial crisis in local authority across england be out of control in recent month an alarming number of they have issue section notice admission that their spending be exceed their income thus effectively declare bankruptcy in the last six year eight authority have issue such notice in the previous year none do it be no long the case that small number of individual council with particular issue be in financial distress we be now see widespread financial distress across large part of local government and the situation be only get bad the committee have hear evidence from the local government association that one fifth of council may be in financial distress within the next year at the heart of this crisis be multi billion pound funding gap the income available to local authority from council tax retain business rate and government grant have not keep pace with the increase demand for their service and the effect of inflation as result the local government association estimate that authority face funding gap of billion over the next two year to maintain service at their current level witness have tell we that the current funding system be broken and not fit for purpose successive government since have reduce the level of central government grant award to local authority by about this have be partly offset by increase in council tax which have therefore lead to an overall reduction in local authority core spending power of in real term between and in the short term local authority need immediate additional funding our report recommend that the government must include additional funding in the local government finance settlement for to fill the gap last week the government announce million of extra funding and give credit to the minister who have be assiduous in listen to the view of member on this subject however although those measure be welcome they be not sufficient our report recognise that the government have recently begin consultation on other method of increase the fund available to local authority we have cautiously welcome the fact that they be consider give authority additional capital flexibility to fund day to day cost but we have recommend that those additional flexibility should be consider carefully and limit to extend flexibility over invest to save activity we do not want to store up problem for future year our report also recommend other way in which the government can improve fund for local authority in the medium term we have repeat the recommendation which our committee first make in that the government must urgently reform council tax this would involve undertake revaluation of property and introduce additional council tax band finally we have once again call for the government to implement the business rate reset and fair funding review to which they commit themselves in but which they have yet to deliver and to reintroduce multi year settlement our inquiry ask witness what have cause the sharp rise in council expenditure it identify three particular area where cost have rise significantly adult and child social care special educational need and homelessness on adult social care the increasingly complex need of change population continue to drive up cost and long term workforce shortage and inflationary pressure have make the position bad as the committee recommend back in the government need to recognise that local authority will need several billion pound of additional funding each year to continue to deliver and improve adult social care and should plan sustainable mechanism to deliver this funding that do not simply rely on increase council tax on child social care our inquiry find that council be face rise demand for residential care placement and poorly function market for provide they that have drive significant cost increase our report recommend an urgent comprehensive reform of the child social care system as part of that the government should help local authority consider great collaboration so that between they they can deliver more child care service directly instead of through private supplier our inquiry also find that local authority face significant financial pressure in provide service for child and young people with special educational need and disability send the number of education health and care plan have skyrocket since they be introduce in which have significantly increase demand for more expensive form of send provision and home to school transport funding be provide to local authority through the dedicated school grant but it be not enough to meet the demand and do not cover home to school transport the government have already be force to take temporary measure to prevent send cost from force large number of council into bankruptcy in the government introduce statutory override allow local authority to exclude any deficit on their dsg spending from their main revenue budget local government face potential cliff edge of section notice whenever the statutory override come to an end the question be will the treasury write off that extra borrowing when the time come our report recommend therefore that in the short term the government should provide additional funding for home to school transport in the long term there need to be fundamental reform of the ehcp base on cross government review finally our report make it clear that rise homelessness have increase cost for council big cause of the increase have be the government decision to freeze local housing allowance rate in april so our report welcome the government recent announcement that they will increase local housing allowance rate from april however it also raise concern about the government decision to then re freeze the rate in instead we recommend that local housing allowance should be retain at at least the percentile of local market rent in the long term the good solution as the committee have recommend repeatedly be to build more social housing which will always be cheap than pay for temporary accommodation these problem require long term solution that be why the committee have make recommendation in this report for whichever government be elect after the next election the next government regardless of their political persuasion must embark on fundamental review of the system of local authority funding and local taxation both council tax and business rate in do so they must be clear about what local authority be for and how they can well co ordinate with delivery of the government wide objective we have recommend that the next government should consider many option which may include land value taxis and other and wide fiscal devolution they must also explore all option for reform the funding and delivery of social care service to address the underlying cause of the acute funding and delivery pressure currently face by local authority it be my hope that the need we have identify for additional funding will be properly reflect in the local government financial settlement we will debate next week and that our other recommendation will be carefully consider by this government and whoever form the government after the next election commend this report to the house thank you very much for your statement mr betts call bob blackman intend to call the front benchers at the end if everybody be happy with that thank the chairman of the select committee for what he say clearly one problem be that adult social service child social service and homelessness service be all demand lead so it be very difficult for local authority to predict the number of people involve and how much money will be require do he agree that what the government and the department need to look at now be how we can enable local authority to have pool of money nationally that could be use by particular local authority when these demand lead service have dramatically increase the burden on it thank the hon gentleman call he my select committee friend because he have be part of all these debate and always the committee report be unanimous he be absolutely right we have to find way of fund social care in the specific part and for the general social care issue council tax simply can not meet that burden we can not keep put council tax up to cover it that lead on to the additional challenge that most people do not receive social care and what they be see every year be their council tax go up but the service they do get the library park bus and road sweeping be reduce they be pay more and get less and that be not sustainable in the long term commend my hon friend on his brilliant work on local government funding he will know that birmingham city council be under special measure have issue section notice and other service have be hugely hit by the lack of funding one reason council have be force into this position be that there have be lack of funding to the reserve that keep they out of bankruptcy so the lack of proper funding for local authority be real issue recognise the particular problem in birmingham some council that have issue section notice have specific problem we know about the equal pay issue in birmingham for example some council be refer generally have perhaps bring those problem on themselves however as we say in the report the challenge be no long just individual council with particular problem but the generality of local government be under pressure as set out by all our witness from the sector in that situation any challenging problem that come to council on top of general problem can tip it over the edge thank my hon friend for his report barnsley council budget have see some of the big cut in the country which make it even more impressive that it have be give two award for be council of the year to date my constituency of barnsley east have receive no levelling up funding although such funding be drop in the ocean compare with the figure my hon friend be discuss we be await the decision on our final bid which be make to the cultural fund do the chair of the select committee know when that might be announce note the minister be in his place and hope he will look on the elsecar heritage centre bid favourably if it be in my gift of course would give barnsley the money it be ask for today but unfortunately it be not in another report the committee be fairly critical of the individual pot for level up which be not join up together it be unsatisfactory that some council can get bit of money from all these pot while other get nothing at all to address those problem we have suggest move towards single pot for local authority reflect their need and give great discretion and freedom to decide on spending at local level we be quite long way off that at this stage in principle the government recognise that be the way to travel but they have not get road map about how we be go to get there thank my hon friend for all his work on this important report it be privilege to serve on the levelling up housing and communities committee under his chairship he do not need to tell he that like many local authority nottingham city council be in perilous financial position our council spending power have be cut by huge compare with despite high level of deprivation in our city this be considerably high than the average still devastating reduction of among council how important do he believe it be to make the local government funding system fairer completely agree that it should be make fair the only caveat would add be that one authority system of fair funding be another authority unfair funding which be always challenge everyone accept that the funding system must be bring up to date the current funding system have datum in it that go back to the last century which be not reasonable way to allocate money in the current age so yes it need to be revise on the funding cut and the council tax increase the big funding cut have tend to be make to those council that use to receive the most grant which tend to be the poor council the council tax increase have disadvantage council with low council tax base which tend to be those council who receive the big cut we have not go into that in detail in this report but know we have have evidence to that effect in the past thank the chair of the select committee for this important report which make sobering reading for member across the house do he agree that the reason his measure be so necessary in leeds be that government funding to leeds city council have be cut by the conservative government by billion since that have leave leeds city council an excellent labour run council with shortfall of million for the financial year the billion of cut to government funding since equate to about million per ward leave the council struggle to deliver essential service for some of the most vulnerable people in our city be that not why everyone here regardless of their political party need to support the measure set out in this report thank my hon friend for his question we clearly set out that the problem be due to cut in funding that be the result of reduction in the central government grant with council tax increase only partly but not wholly replace the fund that issue need address if we want council to continue not only perform social care function but do everything else that our community rely on we need fundamental reform that be what we be call for in the long term that be challenge for any government look at both front benches here because if we reform local finance some people will have to pay more and some will have to pay less always say that those people who pay more never forget about it and continue to blame the government for year to come those who pay less will thank the government and then forget about it next year there be always challenge when it come to spread the tax take around differently but we will have to do it differently because these council service not just social care but the park the bus the library the road the environmental service the planning and the economic development which have almost fall off the scale in some council be really important the reality be that year of ideological austerity cut have leave many authority on the brink of bankruptcy from to now bradford council have have million worth of cut which have leave our service decimate and our community devastate and deprive of much need service thank the chair of the select committee for his report particularly welcome the call for much need and immediate funding for local authority do he agree that the much need funding must be give and if it be not give any blame for section notice should lie directly and squarely at the door of this government thank my hon friend for his question the report say that not every section notice can be blame on the government there will be circumstance in which council get themselves into difficulty but what we have say be that there be general problem come down for council which have be create by shortage of funding we do make reference to bradford bradford problem be the young age of its population the number of child child service be run by trustee appoint by the secretary of state for education that body have demand from the council an amount equivalent to about of its council budget we could get the ridiculous situation in which the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities send in commissioner to run service to try to find the money to pay the trustee who be appoint by the secretary of state for education that do not seem great way for local government to operate thank the chair of the select committee for what think be very important report also thank the committee member who have spend significant amount of time get under the skin of the issue first do he agree that ahead of the schedule finance settlement next wednesday the government need to finally take responsibility for the financial crisis in local government secondly do he share my concern that the breakdown in local government audit be contribute to the removal of the early warning system thank my hon friend for that question yes it certainly be do so have just produce report about local government audit there be real problem there if account have not be audit for three year as in most case but probably long in other case how on earth do we know what be happen in local council finance certainly get local audit on an even keel by the end of this year be very important but where account be qualified as they will be council should not be blame for that it be the problem of the local audit system and we really must sort that out on behalf of the government thank the chair of the select committee and all his colleague on it for the work that they do in general and for the report in particular will obviously study it with great care and respond in the usual way he make number of point think we can all agree that certainty and security for the local government sector be important and concur with his view that there be clear merit in multi year settlement also agree that whoever be stand at the dispatch box in the role of local government minister after the next general election pray to god that it will be and hope that my prayer will be answer reform will always be difficult and complex would be interested to know whether the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts see any merit in establish some cross party working and blue sky thinking on the issue in order hopefully to land something that can deliver certainty and security for five or year ahead to give comfort to local government leader section officer and other while might not completely agree with the minister prayer agree that if we be to sort this out for the long term particularly social care funding we need system that have general support the committee have call for that in the past what we do on pension reform few year ago cross party have stick so there be merit in that suggestion whether we can achieve it do not know but we ought to try on point of order mr deputy speaker this morning my hon friend the member for wansbeck ian lavery ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs what owner of xl bully dog who have miss the registration deadline for genuine reason can do to ensure that they keep in line with guidance constituent who miss the deadline contact my office today they be unable to get their dog neuter in time for genuine reason the advice of the secretary of state be to register as soon as possible however the government website say that the service be now close seek your advice on how thing can be correct and the website can be reopen if that be the intention of the secretary of state so that dog owner who want to do the right thing and register their pet can do so thank the hon member for her point of order and her forward notice of it clearly the chair be not responsible for the accuracy of ministers remark but at the same time we want they to be accurate hope that those on the treasury bench have hear what she have have to say and will ensure that the secretary of state have it bring to his attention at the same give that she be diligent member of parliament be sure that she will bring it directly to the notice of ministers far to that point of order mr deputy speaker have hear what the hon lady say it be serious point will ensure that my official raise it with the office of the secretary of

the iranian democratic opposition the national council of resistance of iran ncri target in particular member of the organise opposition pmoi mek in ashraf albania and ncri gathering since note that the resistance be struggle for the establishment of secular democratic republic call on european government especially the government of albania to counter tehran illegal activity and uphold the right

international counterpart to ensure that further sanction be place on iran without delay and iran be hold to account for its illegal activity at home and abroad thank the speakers collect and the backbench business committee for the various arrangement that have to be make because of this afternoon emergency business be truly horrify by the current situation in iran which be spark by the brutal murder of young girl by the authority while she be in police custody her crime if we could call it crime be merely wear she hijab in manner that the islamic revolutionary guard corps determine to be too loose thank mr speaker in particular for allow on number of occasion to debate this issue in the house however wish this debate have take place under different circumstance and that by now our government have take decisive action to proscribe the irgc in its entirety the urgency for this charge be now more relevant than ever not only do the human right situation in iran remain dire but the uncertainty around the middle east which be spread far afield at rapid rate be predominantly drive by the funding and support from this exceptionally threatening connive and deceitful regime my hon friend be make an excellent speech do he agree that the iranian people be lock in vital struggle for justice democracy and particularly equality and that that struggle must go on until the oppression of woman in iran and the use of sexual violence as means of do so stop thank my hon friend she must have look at the next section of my speech the irgc literally run and rule iran disregard democracy freedom of expression and basic human right the majority of people live in fear of speak out or engage in political matter in any form with vigorous covert intelligence deploy to all part of the country seek to sift out any potential opposition that might pose threat to the regime the authority censor all medium jam satellite tv channel and filtering and block social medium platform such as facebook instagram twitter and youtube far the authority shut off or disrupt the internet and mobile phone network particularly during protest in order to suppress mobilisation and hide from civilian the sheer scale of the violation and privacy breach commit by the security force in attempt to justify the infringement the irgc be even try to push an internet user protection bill through the parliament in iran that legislation would far erode online freedom and people access to the global internet all opposition in iran whether it be independent political party trade union strike worker protester civil society organisation or simply truth share journalist be brutally suppress there have never be clear example of an undemocratic self claim democracy political opposition frequently receive the harsh treatment from the regime and iran be the country responsible for the second high number of execution each year behind only china whatever people view on capital punishment it can not be acceptable that that position persist the house will no doubt recall the uprising that take place in september spark nationwide protest that continue even today take this opportunity to honour the bravery of those people it can not be easy for anyone to stand up and speak for basic right when there be high likelihood that they or their family will be brutally target as result follow the riot the united nations special rapporteur on the situation of human right in iran javaid rehman raise the alarm about the concern trend of arbitrary arrest detention and execution target individual for merely exercise their freedom of expression the hon member be make brilliant speech the dead hand of iran be unfortunately everywhere its influence and impact be incredible and would suggest that it be even in this place there be an all party parliamentary group whose secretariat be bird the bahrain institute for rights and democracy that be lead by man sayed al wadaei who be out as front leader for the promotion of iranian foreign policy in man call saeed al shehabi be expose by the london evening standard as part of terrorist group with link to iran that organisation and those people be part of secretariat to an appg here and that need to be expose and member need to take action thank the hon member for raise that point that be now clearly on the record and the house authority will need to look at that particular issue recently release figure which be sure will have be generously taint by the regime show that execution take place in alone that be increase on the previous year and many of those people be woman and child ten of thousand of political prisoner the overwhelming majority be peaceful have be arrest in iran arrest for merely hold sign or remove headscarf once arrest their treatment be utterly unfathomable amnesty international have recently report that the atrocity such prisoner be subject to include be beat rap gang rap and psychologically abuse the list of horror go on it be truly despicable as my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth say the plight of woman remain intensely troubling woman remain second class citizen in iran they continue to receive intensify opposition from the regime they face entrenched discrimination in both law and practice and they be subject to domestic violence child marriage unequal divorce and custody right mandatory dress code restrict nationality and travel right and unfair inheritance law to name but few example woman in iran have be jail for merely sing in public or publish their work on social medium perhaps even more troublingly iran celebrate the great number of female execution beat even china on that particular front armita geravand be year old schoolgirl who be tragically kill through the brutality of the so call iranian morality police like mahsa amini her only crime be refuse to wear she hijab sadly such story be not isolate in iran and be sad to say that they will continue without significant intervention from international community and the iranian people be proud that in this house alone we have an abundance of great woman represent we their contribution be vital and champion by we all it be shock that in this be far from the case across many other part of the globe be grateful to my hon friend for give way yet again he be make an absolutely brilliant first class speech and shin light on the despicable brutal regime in iran do he agree that that brutal regime be literally on an execution spree at the moment have execute more than protester and dissident since the conflict in gaza begin that be rate of execution of not far off protester per month do he agree that it be long overdue that the uk and our partner demand that the un human rights council dispatch an international fact find mission to iran to visit the regime prisoner to meet political prisoner and detain protester so that globally we can finally shine light on what be happen in iran and of course he be right that the irgc should be proscribe thank my hon friend that be almost speech rather than an intervention have have the privilege on number of occasion to visit ashraf which be home to some iranian refugee the museum on the site exceptionally depict the long struggle that people have endure with brutal attack and massacre occur all too frequently in albania the regime claw continue to menace the people the irgc have repeatedly target the albanian government through cyber attack disinformation and terror attack be sadden that on occasion most notably in june last year the camp have be raid by the albanian police force there have be report of unjustified force and copious amount of pepper spray be use unfortunately one man die from the injury that he suffer be almost certain that that attack be found on false claim generate by the irgc the regime hold power over albania its continued attack on cyber system be use as so call warning to the government blackmail they with threat of continue attack if they do not suppress the right of camp member urge the albanian government to stand up to those threat no country should infringe its moral for fear of such corrupt and wicked enemy this be time for western ally to stick together and stand up to malicious terror act be glad that our inter parliamentary union delegation will be go to albania shortly and hope that they will raise this issue the albanian prime minister have say publicly that resident of ashraf should not engage in any political activity even peaceful conversation that be tantamount to deny the right to freedom of expression be sadden that that announcement come after show of support for the camp by albanian parliamentarian show that the dramatic shift in opinion must be down to the negotiation with the irgc hope that the minister will assure the house that he will offer support to our albanian counterpart encourage they to stand up to the regime and protect the right of those in that camp who have already experience too much brutality this debate come at time when the world have never be so unsafe we have war rag in europe attack by the houthis in the red sea an illegal war in gaza by the hamas terror group hezbollah in lebanon and war in syria as well as other dangerous militant group the one thing that link all those example be the irgc which stand as the head of the snake funding training and supply weaponry to all those organisation its outreach and capability be frankly frightening the irgc have be find to have supply drone and weapon to russia as moscow and tehran deepen their co operation in partnership that be likely to continue and intensify as they commonly seek to weaken the west furthermore the irgc provide significant direct funding and training to hamas in the lead up to the dreadful october attack most recently the houthis in yemen have target shipping lane in the red sea the houthi militant group be set up by iran and remain under its influence link to those attack iran announce that it have subsequently launch into low earth orbit three satellite that the us believe can be use to more accurately target intercontinental ballistic missile the regime in iran ignite threat not only to the international community but perhaps most concerningly to the domestic security of the uk individual with iranian link or who have speak out against the irgc in this country have frequently be target furthermore announce last year that it have intercept significant number of iran back terror attack the hon member be make an incredibly powerful speech and congratulate he on secure the debate he be quite right last year we hear from the director general of and the head of counter terrorism policing that they have intervene to disrupt up to kidnapping and assassination attempt in the uk come from iran that be why the argument for proscription be such powerful one it would not be merely symbolic it would be about grant the security service and police force in the uk additional power to truly dismantle any foothold that the irgc have in the uk that allow it to facilitate those assassination attempt which we must close down do he agree that that be why proscription be so important thank the hon lady for her intervention the position here be that the iranian government be fund professional gang to inflict attack and violence on individual in this country they have neither mercy nor moral in how far they will go spanish politician and vocal opponent of the iranian regime be shoot outside his home by criminal gang employ by the irgc we must not allow such despicable attack to occur on domestic soil it be completely unacceptable that people in this country be be follow home or have to suppress their freedom of expression for fear of be target urge the government to tackle this issue with urgency the iranian authority have be target bbc persian staff who be predominantly base in the uk and their family since in an attempt to intimidate they into stop their work as journalist the intimidation escalate in and have be at an unprecedented level since september bbc persian staff frequently receive credible death threat threat of horrific violence thousand of abusive comment and increase threat to their personal safety on online platform with several colleague be target of the iranian regime when we attend the annual gathering of the national council of resistance of iran with delegation from almost every major democracy back in an iranian diplomat try to bomb the conference he have the audacity to smuggle the bomb through security in diplomatic bag thankfully the belgian and french authority apprehend the terrorist and no one be harm have he succeed there would have be world war the iranians assume responsibility and they force the belgian authority to hand over this despicable so call diplomat after they kidnap two belgian journalist and hold they as hostage if this do not highlight to the government that we can not engage in dialogue with the iranian regime do not know what will the key point be that the current policy on iran be not work its influence be stretch across the middle east and far it be time to look for an alternative solution and urge the government to proscribe this merciless regime with utmost priority be aware that we have already sanction individual but we must go far until we start crack down on the irgc it will continue to extort and suppress innocent people its military capacity be grow and even if it do not already possess nuclear capability have my doubt its nuclear capability will also grow the international community must wake up and protect country such as israel by kill the initial piece of the chain without funding and support from iran terrorist like hamas will not be able to carry out their dreadful attack iran will feel the pinch only if there be full proscription and reiterate my plea for the government to do so hezbollah be already proscribe and it be the birthchild of the irgc the irgc must therefore be proscribe too have hear the rumour that the government be hold off such action in order to continue line of dialogue but there be no honest or trustworthy dialogue to be have with this terrorist regime instead we must show iran that such action be not and will not be tolerate fifty per cent of the irgc training effort be on indoctrination create more ruthless more radical and more committed generation the danger be only increase so we must act before it be too late it be high time that we work together to banish this unlawful regime to protect innocent protestor and to champion free democratic right across the world we often take those right for grant to oppose the iranian regime be no long political calculation but simple humanitarian choice we must support the iranian people and acknowledge the legitimacy of the iranian opposition if we be ever to see free and democratic iran look forward to hear from colleague on both side of the house know that several member who want to take part in this debate have unfortunately have to leave but hope we will have excellent reply from my hon friend the minister and indeed the shadow minister order mr paisley during your intervention on mr blackman you make reference to an individual member of the secretariat to an all party parliamentary group it be very serious allegation if you have any correspondence or information in relation to that individual could you please pass it to mr speaker inform and will follow it through thank you for that ruling mr deputy speaker appreciate that you be take it seriously have make arrangement for substantial dossier of information to be leave with mr speaker this afternoon be very grateful congratulate the hon member for harrow east bob blackman on set the scene his passion and interest in this subject be renowned in my short time in the house can not remember time when he do not lead or sponsor such debate it seem that for various reason other who wish to speak have not be able to it be unfortunate that the input of other have be curtail but that do not lessen the importance of the issue that the hon gentleman have raise when it come to iran we in this place have speak up on many occasion indeed we do so yesterday in the free iran group with maryam rajavi the hon member for southend west anna firth be at that meeting and lead and chair it for short period of time this be big issue massive issue declare an interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief speak up for those of christian faith those of other faith and those of no faith it be clear to that that be not just about people right to express themselves religiously and the belief that they have but about stand up for human right the issue of freedom and democracy in iran especially the freedom of religion or belief continue to escalate depressingly so that be why this debate be so important violation of freedom of religion or belief happen frequently in iran and continue to escalate the hon member for harrow east be right to highlight the danger that iran pose to peace in the middle east it supply the houthis with aid and finance supply hezbollah in lebanon with finance and weapon supply hamas in gaza with aid arm and finance and supply many terrorist group in syria in the same way of course iran also supply drone to russia to use against ukraine so it be an instigator of war and an opposer of peace in the middle east as persecution and violation of religious freedom increase in frequency and impact and other member of the appg have submit several write question to the foreign commonwealth and development office be very pleased to see the minister in his place because he be always helpful in his response we have write to the fcdo with large number of question over period of time but unfortunately response have not be forthcoming ask the minister to introduce some speed into the process if possible to secure an answer within the prescribed time the fcdo say it would respond to our question and be duty bind to do so but have not respond yet the incident we have highlight and the fcdo response to they must be bring to parliament attention as well as the importance of develop well policy and sanction against iran for those action and for its denial of freedom and democracy the one thing that have always bother when it come to iran be its violation against woman and child they have be attack brutalise and scar by acid attack they have no access to job education or ownership of property they do not have the right to marriage and many other opportunity in society be deny they over christmas several christians be arrest in iran with no response yet from the fcdo again we be wait for response iran finally release on temporary bail two journalist who cover the death in custody of mahsa amini which lead to the mass protest in we ask the fcdo whether the minister would make an assessment of the implication of those release for its policy but as yet there have be no response recently the iranian government displace farmer by seize farmland that they have be tend for several generation the fcdo respond to my question on that topic by state at the un general assembly we co sponsor the iran human rights resolution call for iran to eliminate in law and in practice all form of discrimination on the basis of thought conscience religion or belief we be committed to promote religious freedom and will continue to work with partner to advocate for the right of the community in iran such action be commendable and appreciate what action have be take to help implement that resolution again ask these question because know the minister will respond also look forward to the response of the shadow minister the hon member for caerphilly wayne david and of the snp spokesperson the hon member for linlithgow and east falkirk martyn day the uk recently enact new sanction against iranian individual for human right violation include flog as punishment for exercise freedom of religion or belief roya heshmati be flog by police for not wear hijab in picture post on her social medium have also pose question to the fcdo on that topic what sanction have be impose on those who inflict such persecution most importantly potential violence and armed conflict with other country may impact the right of democracy and freedom especially for religious minority in iran so we must decide what policy be go to be enact iranian back group have attack us base in jordan and this bring about the increase of tension between the west and iran despite iran denial of its involvement in the attack it get its proxy to carry out it out as armed conflict and violence increase the oppression of religious minority increase tenfold for someone to be christian or member of an ethnic minority in iran decrease their life expectancy we must be ever mindful of the situation of religious minority in iran but also of what the potential effect may be of uk action against iran through sanction and change in diplomatic relation the hon member for harrow east make point about what we need to do and to do more of and it be quite clear that the sanction the government be impose be not effective because of that we have to look at other method such as strong sanction or other idea again would like to hear from the minister if possible what thought he have about how we can hit iran hard iran be continue to arbitrarily detain human right defender and nobel peace prize recipient narges mohammadi subject she to torture and other ill treatment by deliberately deny or severely delay her access to adequate healthcare to coerce she into adhere to iran abusive and degrade compulsory veiling law this place narges mohammadi health at great risk particularly as she have serious heart and lung condition jail be never good for someone health and if they be in bad health it be even bad if iran be willing to imprison and mistreat such an individual what be to prevent it from do so with ordinary individual in iran who have religious identity or belief different from those of the majority although we may not be able to force iran to change its law we can place further requirement on their do trade with the uk when we look at trade last year we see that the uk export nearly million of trade to iran and in return iran sell back some million what regulation and policy be company require to adhere to for such trade to occur be there any human right and religious freedom requirement in place or inspection of company in iran to ensure that they adhere to human right working condition and do not discriminate against religious minority in hire or in the workplace these be the thing would like to see conclude with this the need for iran to raise its treatment of religious minority and to provide citizen with democracy be become more and more necessary that be why the hon gentleman debate today be so important and we hope we look to everyone for this but ultimately to the minister that the response will be one that give we heart as you know mr deputy speaker speak today on behalf of my brother and sister in the faith in iran who do not have the opportunity to worship their god as do it be for that reason that think have to be here to speak for they be grateful to the hon member for harrow east bob blackman for secure this debate the issue of freedom and democracy in iran be very important one and find myself commend he for his speech and agree with every point he make as we have hear the issue be really about lack of democracy and lack of freedom election will of course be hold on march to iran parliament but they can in no way can be consider free fair or credible it be more of selection than an election with the unelected strong guardian council have the power to approve candidate with track record of ban moderate and reformer from stand it be no surprise that many candidate have already be disqualify this body can also veto law make by the parliament my litmus test for fair free and credible democratic election be can any individual freely stand for election can anyone vote in secret for any individual who be stand and can the sovereignty of the people be exercise by their representative clearly iran fail on all those count the reality be that iran be rule as totalitarian theocracy it be not democracy ultimate power rest in the hand of the country supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and the unelected institution under his control corruption persist across all level with powerful actor such as the islamic revolutionary guards corps operate beyond scrutiny medium and civil society face restriction hinder their role as independent watchdog for ensure transparency and accountability the regime as we have hear be ruthlessly hold in place by its intelligence and security force the irgc and be support by the wide apparatus of the state include the judiciary the ministry of intelligence the police and other iranian authority have extensively use iran repressive machinery to censor discussion of these issue and persecute woman human right defender and anti death penalty activist political activist who support democratic change have be particularly vulnerable to detention and death over many year despite which the organise resistance the people mujaheddin organisation of iran or mek have remain determined to establish free democratic and secular republic and wish they every success with that struggle the level of oppression and human right abuse by the current regime in iran be truly appalling and be get bad accord to freedom house iran have decrease its total global freedom status from derisory out of in to out of last year freedom house give iran zero score for most area of fundamental right include the individual right to practice or express religion faith or non belief in public and private free and independent medium the government operate with openness and transparency safeguard against corruption the question of whether the freely elect head of government and national legislative representative determine the policy of the government and fair and free election the un special rapporteur on the situation of human right in the islamic republic of iran express alarm at the disproportionate number of execution of member of minority community in particular the baluch and kurdish minority and share this concern last year at least people be execute the high figure since any use of the death penalty be unacceptable to and believe this substantial increase reflect the regime inability to suppress the protest that have arise woman lack equality and face discrimination in both law and practice example include woman testimony in court be give half the weight of man and unequal compensation for victim family woman also face disparity in inheritance right the regime fail to protect woman and child from sex trafficking while iranians and migrant worker especially from afghanistan be subject to force labour and debt bondage the reality be that some million iranians be effectively live in what be state prison otherwise know as the islamic republic of iran but it do not have to be that way and applaud the courage and determination of those who have stand up to the regime and protest for the right that we take for grant and have do so at great risk to themselves the ongoing uprising begin in september with the arrest of kurdish iranian girl in tehran by the tehran morality police for not veil after which she be brutally beat fall into coma and tragically lose her life while in custody that brutal killing of mahsa amini prompt widespread protest across iran with thousand of people demand regime change for secular democratic republic the ongoing uprising have result in over unlawful death include of minor and woman additionally around iranians face cruel treatment in jail include torture and sexual violence highlight the dire situation in iran ultimately iran future must be decide by its own people but give that they have virtually no avenue for reform the people have no option but to resist to demonstrate to defend themselves and to seek alternative form of opposition iran have be witness massive popular uprising call for freedom and democracy largely lead by woman and young people have hear it describe by some as revolution and hope it be successful one it have clearly rattle the tehran regime and believe this be partly behind the regime promote and encourage conflict outwith its border as it seek to dampen the momentum of the protest inside iran while simultaneously rally the regime own force behind the supreme leader fundamentalist agenda as we have hear iran be the big state sponsor of terrorism this exporting of international terrorism by iran can not and will not be tolerate nor should be its support for russia in the war with ukraine use of cyber attack or hostage take diplomacy and condemn the involvement of iranian official in the killing of us servicemen accord to report in the times on tuesday this week tehran have already be accuse by and police of more than dozen assassination and kidnap plot in britain against dissident and medium organisation in the past two year official have previously express fear that embolden by the situation in the middle east iran could ramp up its activity in the uk and present wide terror threat although welcome the recent announcement of additional sanction on senior iranian official wonder why we be not take an even strong approach at minimum we should urgently proscribe the irgc as terrorist organisation have lose count of the number of time that and other have call for that action proscription would be tangible step in the uk in the furtherance of freedom and democracy in iran we should also support call for the un to dispatch international observer to visit iran prison and to meet those detain by the regime we should all support the democratic aspiration of the iranian people pay tribute to the work of the resistance unit that emerge in late and have help inspire iranians to defy the prevail tyranny in conclusion the snp stand in full solidarity with iranians journalist woman man and young people call for democratic change the bravery of iranian citizen stand up against brutality and dictatorship be beyond inspire wish they every success in seek new democratic and secular republic in iran it will be well for they and the world when they succeed commend the hon member for harrow east bob blackman for introduce this debate and the backbench business committee for allow the time for it this debate be important and timely although we have have only few contribution they have be significant and important the hon member mention the ashraf camp in albania and although it be not entirely clear what have happen there it be important to note his point that the inter parliamentary union for which be on the executive of the british group will be send delegation to albania will make point of make sure as good can that the delegation raise the matter in its visit at the start of my contribution make the point that the authoritarian and theocratic regime in iran present and preside over reprehensible repressive state as have be say there be little real democracy in today iran at the beginning of march there will be election to the iranian parliament and the assembly of experts as have be the case in the past the council of guardians will prevent candidate stand whom the supreme leader do not approve we expect that those who be block will be moderate and reform candidate the election will rightly attract great deal of attention not least because they be the first to be hold since the widespread protest in iran follow the death of year old mahsa amini as be sure many member be aware her death in september occur in police custody after she have be arrest for not comply with strict islamic dress code follow her death there be widespread protest across iran for number of month they be cruelly repress by the regime but it be important to remember and to pay tribute to the many thousand of woman and girl who be brave enough to take part indeed be proud to speak in an event in this house organise by the azadi network speaker be from all party in this house and they demonstrate real solidarity which all party have clearly express and stress that that be so important it be the house of commons say to the iranian people we be with you the protest be subject to appal brutality in iran mete out by the iranian authority it be estimate that at least people be detain include many child it be estimate too that more than people be kill and many more be seriously injure the violence do not stop with the end of the demonstration there have be many allegation of torture and appal treatment of detainee include report of sexual and gender base violence against woman man and child as have be say amnesty international have report that iranian security force be guilty of use the most terrible sexual violence against people who be merely peaceful protester it be important to note the comment make by the hon member for strangford jim shannon who speak eloquently about the lack of human right and point out the lack of religious freedom in today iran if the iranian regime be repressive at home it be guilty of aggression abroad in fact it be among the world foremost state sponsor of terrorism iran through its so call proxy be guilty of help to initiate violence across much of the middle east iran have supply huge support to hamas in gaza it have supply and support hezbollah in lebanon and be still do so in iraq include in kurdistan and in syria iranian sponsor militant have attack us force on sunday an iran back group be responsible for drone attack on us military base in jordan that result in the death of three american soldier and the injury of many other people as we all know the houthis who again be closely link to the iranian regime have be conduct missile and drone attack on international shipping in the red sea of course the us and the uk have be undertake surgical strike against houthi target in yemen and labour be on record as support that proportionate action far afield the iranian regime have develop close link with russia and have supply large number of drone that be be use in ukraine so there can be absolutely no doubt about the iranian regime malign influence across the middle east and the world on tuesday raise iran destructive activity across the globe with the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell at fcdo question he indicate that the foreign secretary be in the region that day and hold meeting on the very issue he also say that the government be work extensively with jordan egypt qatar israel saudi arabia and america official report january vol would be appreciative if the minister indicate in his reply how those meeting go and how the ongoing discussion will proceed on this important issue we be aware that iran be active in this country as number of hon member include the hon member for harrow east say the head of have previously refer to potential threat by iran to kidnap or kill british or uk base people in the police discover an iranian link bomb factory in london since the beginning of iranians have be responsible for at least potential threat against british or uk base individual that be recognise by number of hon member in the chamber early this week the times report that number of member of the iranian diaspora who have speak out against the iranian regime have be

iran as well as intimidate staff in this country since the protest in iran in the bbc security team have report that the risk to bbc persian staff have increase because of those very real threat believe that the sanction introduce and the further one announce should be welcome hope however that the government will closely examine other way in which pressure can be bring to bear on the appalling iranian regime one additional measure ought to be the total proscription of the islamic revolutionary guard corps understand that there be ongoing debate in government about this but if they do not bring forward appropriate measure that would lead to total ban of the irgc in this country labour will do so if it form government if the government do that now labour will support it hope that the government will respond in truly positive way this have be an important debate with excellent contribution this issue should unite all of we who believe strongly in democracy freedom and human right in this country and throughout the world be grateful to hon member of the backbench business committee and my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman whom have know many year for

diplomatic engagement that be why iran continue violation of its people right in conjunction with its widening pattern of malign activity around the world remain high priority for the government we will not tolerate iran illegal threat against uk base journalist its escalate nuclear programme its desperate coalition with russia or its reckless use of proxy in the region as hon member will be aware the shocking death of mahsa amini in september spark popular grassroot call for change the aptly name woman life freedom protest challenge decade of gender base discrimination and violence woman and girl proudly defy discriminatory and degrading mandatory hijab law at great risk to their safety and security the iranian authority respond to the protest with intimidation and violence by kill at least people and detain they show complete disregard for the right of their own people there have be few protest since then but we should not take that as evidence of diminish appetite for change among the iranian people suppress dissent may momentarily silence the people but it will never kill their desire for more just future the uk have be consistent and clear in its condemnation of iran undemocratic and disproportionate response to the protest movement iran have be designate an fcdo human right priority country since october we have sanction individual and entity for human right violation include decision maker responsible for draft and implement iran mandatory hijab legislation and political and security official involve in the crackdown at the heart of the popular uprising be the right of woman and girl which be key element of our foreign policy the uk government stand in solidarity with they as they continue to show immense bravery in the face of brutal repression the enforcement of mandatory hijab law have become symbol of gender inequality in iranian society but across the board woman and girl do not enjoy the same right and privilege as man they face unequal right as highlight so well by my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth who be no long in her place in marriage divorce child custody and be even prevent from attend sporting event ten of

for woman and girl in iran and we look forward to hear its finding at the upcoming human rights council session at the very centre of freedom and human right be the right to life the uk oppose the death penalty as matter of principle in all circumstance across the world iran surge use of execution be matter of grave concern for the united kingdom last year iran execute more than people include protester as have be highlight by my hon friend the members for harrow east and for southend west far too often the death penalty be impose absent of any fair trial or due process and ethnic minority such as kurds and baluchis make up disproportionate number of execution as rightly highlight by the hon member for linlithgow and east falkirk martyn day the government be use all lever at our disposal include work with the international community to push back against this egregious crime at the human rights council last year we sign joint statement alongside partner call for iran to establish an immediate moratorium on execution with view to abolish the death penalty altogether at the session of the un general assembly we urge iran to commute the sentence for child offender on death row we will continue to monitor iran imposition of the death penalty on protester and we have make clear to iran both in public and in private our opposition to its application of the death penalty turn now to freedom of religion or belief an important issue that be close to the heart of the hon member for strangford jim shannon and indeed my own and the heart of other involve in this debate it be very clear that religious minority face continue abuse of their most basic right religious minority include christian and sunni muslim community suffer discrimination in law and practice include in access to education employment political office and the most basic of all place of worship in the international sphere we have call on iran to allow every individual the right to freedom of thought conscience religion or belief in accordance with its obligation under the international covenant on civil and political right in october we call on iran to release imprison elderly and medically vulnerable and reassert our commitment to work with partner to promote the right of community in iran will follow up on the response from the fcdo that the hon member for strangford be talk about we can discuss that after this debate if he would like to do so we continue to leverage our relationship with human right organisation and religious community in the uk to highlight and condemn abuse the uk dedicated and incredibly hard work special envoy for freedom of religion or belief my hon friend the member for congleton fiona bruce work on the world stage to push back against abuse of basic freedom at all opportunity include in iran we have an excellent debate on this subject in westminster hall last week free press be central tenet of every healthy democracy and iran fall short in this area too as have be highlight two woman journalist who report on mahsa amini death and the subsequent protest be give lengthy prison sentence simply for do their job while the iranian authority continue to use surveillance to censor and coerce the population as member of the media freedom coalition the uk have call on iran to respect its commitment under international law that also mean co operate with all un body and mandate holder include the un special rapporteur who be responsible for report on human right abuse in iran during the debate we hear of concern about bbc persian correspondent we remain committed to ensure that journalist at home and abroad can do their job without fear of retribution the government law enforcement and security service continue to work with international partner to identify deter and respond to threat to uk journalist include those work for bbc persian last week we sanction member of the irgc for an assassination plot against uk base persian language journalist at iran international our priority be the safety and security of the uk and the people who live here since january the uk have identify at least threat highlight by the hon member for halifax holly lynch and indeed the opposition spokesman the hon member for caerphilly wayne david to the life of uk base individual include journalist that be clearly unacceptable the uk government law enforcement agency and our international partner be work together to ensure that persian language medium can operate without editorial interference and threat from iran be glad that the minister have reflect on that point let say again that to proscribe the irgc would not be symbolic it would be do to reflect the very serious threat that it pose to in particular the journalist who be here in the uk and to equip our security service and police force with additional power to really go after those individual it seem that we be send the charity commission to investigate institution or basis that be believe to have link with the irgc view the charity commission with the utmost respect but we lack those other power that we would enable we to send in those force that would recognise the threat that the irgc pose and drive it out of this country know that the hon member feel passionately about this issue and know that my hon friend the member for harrow east feel strongly about it as well that be exactly the point that be go to come to several members have raise the issue of the irgc which we have already sanction in its entirety the hon member for halifax will be familiar with what be about to say but will put it on the record we have real concern about the intent and activity of the irgc the separate list of terrorist organisation proscription be keep under review but we do not routinely comment on whether an organisation be under consideration we be actively disrupt iranian malign activity by mean of range of tool this be about use effective measure to curb iran destabilising activity which have be highlight by the hon member for halifax and other throughout the debate the uk maintain sanction on more than iranian individual entity and align group for role in weapon proliferation regional conflict human right violation and terrorism and more than irgc official have be sanction since october comment have be make about iran interference in other country notably today in albania which be typical of its nefarious tactic we support partner in the face of pressure from iran and follow the visit of the hon member for caerphilly and that of the inter parliamentary union we will be interested to find out whether there be any other intelligence that we need to learn from if so we will gather it in the hon member for north antrim ian paisley who be no long in the chamber raise sad case involve the secretariat of an all party parliamentary group we would be very interested to see the dossier that the appg have give to mr speaker if that be appropriate and we will do anything we can to follow that up point have also be make about iran nuclear programme which have never be more advanced than it be today and which threaten international peace and security iran behaviour since those negotiation have make progress much more difficult and we be work with our international partner to co ordinate our response we be clear about the fact that iran pose an unacceptable threat to israel for instance through its long term support for hamas in december designation be make under our new iran sanction regime target the head of the irgc quds force irgc individual and an entity link to iran relationship with proxy group such as hamas other point be make about what we be do in the light of the action in which iran have be engage through actor such as the houthis the target strike which have be support by member on both side of the house have be as we have say today limited necessary and proportionate military action be of course always last resort we continue our diplomatic effort talk to country in the region such as oman and turkey the hon member for caerphilly be interested in these point but we provide warning after warning include at the un security council and directly to the iran foreign minister yet the houthis have continue the attack if necessary the uk will not hesitate to respond again in self defence we can not stand by and allow these attack to go unchallenged in conclusion it be clear that iranian authority be impose policy at odd with the value of freedom and democracy as have be say across the chamber their upcoming election be clearly not go to be free and fair and will not address the concern set out in this debate for as long as that remain the case we will continue to work across government and with the international community to hold iran to account for its unacceptable behaviour the repression of woman and girl the uninhibited use of the death penalty and violent crackdown on dissent voice within iran can not go unchallenged but that be also true of iran behaviour in the region and beyond we will continue to work with international partner to make it clear to iran that we will not stand for destabilising activity that threaten our value and our security and indeed the security of the region like the iranian people we want to see an iran that respect the right and freedom of its citizen and respect international law and norm that be why we be urge its leader to listen to the iranian people who be call for well future be grateful for the minister comment about the dossier that be be pass to the speaker in relation to the all party parliamentary group for the remain two minute call bob blackman with the leave of the house let thank hon member from across the house for send joint message to the people currently administer iran that we want to see free and democratic iran with woman in particular have the right that they would enjoy in this country and in other country around the world we see that the united states be likely to take action in the next few day against iranian target as result of the recent murder of the three soldier and the minister set out series of measure that this country be take to combat iran and in particular the irgc clearly however this be not work the number of execution continue to increase and the nefarious activity of the irgc continue find it difficult to understand why we do not take the ultimate step and proscribe the irgc in its entirety for one will continue to lobby for that to be do as will members from across the house understand that the minister can not answer that today but the government need to consider the matter and come forward we have proscribe hamas hezbollah and recently hizb ut tahrir so surely the head of the snake must be proscribe we can then look forward to free and democratic iran and as we always say next year in free and democratic tehran question put and agree to resolve that this house condemn unreservedly the action of the government of iran and the violent conduct of the police in suppress protest in that country be deeply concerned over tehran grow use of terrorism espionage cyber attack and hostage take diplomacy to restrict and eliminate the iranian democratic opposition the national council of resistance of iran ncri target in particular member of the

list of proscribe terrorist organisation and far call upon the government to work with international counterpart to ensure that further sanction be place on iran without delay and iran be hold to account for its illegal activity at home and abroad blackpool regeneration motion make and question propose that this house do now jenkinson it be pleasure to open this adjournment debate on the regeneration of bond street and waterloo road in blackpool two area of my constituency in particular need of capital investment for reason that will become clear before go on to speak particularly about those two area it would be remiss of not to elaborate more on the significant level of capital and revenue regeneration money that have already fly into my constituency thank to the effort of this government million be the total of additional investment that have come into blackpool since be elect in it be staggering figure for all the criticism throw at this government by the opposition the commitment of ministers and different prime ministers from this government to level up and to blackpool in particular can not be understate that commitment be already bear fruit in the substantial progress we be make not just in term of level up the different part of blackpool but in get people the well pay job they need so badly and in welcome investment into my constituency would be here until midnight if go through all the individual funding pot we have be allocate but will not test your patience mr deputy speaker will give the house just flavour of the different funding that have come to blackpool courtesy of this government faith in the work we be do locally we have secure million for the court relocation which have allow million private investment project one of the large private investment in the whole of the north west on the old blackpool central train station site it will create job and lead to ten of million of pound of additional consumer spending come to blackpool we have be grant million for brand new multiversity provide the next generation with the skill they need to get on in life some million provide by one of the large town deal in the country have be spend upgrade the blackpool illumination create thousand of job at the enterprise zone and new sport hub at revoe on top of that we have million in levelling up funding for transport improvement in the town centre furth million in levelling up funding to redo the former post office building on abingdon street and plethora of extra funding for health education crime cultural and sporting project all of which will lay the groundwork for investment in regeneration in blackpool if we be get so much money into blackpool what be the purpose of this adjournment debate it would be remiss of not to point out that blackpool be the most deprived local authority area in england and it have often be say that my constituency be the most in need of level up the community that be the subject of this debate be in the top most deprived community in the entire country and in the second most deprived ward of some ward in england that ward and the community of revoe central drive bond street and waterloo road have significant challenge with poor health low life expectancy on par with sub saharan africa drug relate death total that be the high in the western world and skill and education deficiency that be sadly the high in western europe the unemployment total be four time the national average in addition to those problem the housing stock in these community be among the bad in the country it be estimate that third of the property in inner blackpool be deem to be non decent by current standard poor housing be associate with wide range of health condition and our local nhs practitioner estimate that the cost to the council and other local stakeholder be an additional million because of the health condition with which people present as consequence of their appalling housing condition on top of that some of our working age population be out of the workforce due to ill health and the vast majority of those people will live in substandard housing we talk about level up and it be great for minister to cut the ribbon on shiny new high street or brilliant new project we want that as part of the housing lead regeneration project be talk about but level up be ultimately about change people life it be about empower they to have the educational opportunity the health outcome and the employment opportunity that people want to see in the case of blackpool that come down to housing because far too many local people live in housing that be not fit for human being year ago and certainly be not nowadays it be stain on this country that in blackpool we have housing in the condition that it be currently in so housing lead regeneration be desperately need despite some of the challenge that have outline the area of waterloo road bond street and revoe be proud community where people live with hope and aspiration not just for themselves but for their child as well there be many successful new business operate motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now jenkinson despite the challenge in these community the high street be embed with many new and successful business such as sarah at the pitstop café the bull pub rick at the tube station and chris at royal oak furnishings to mention just few but they need support if their high street be to thrive and if they be to make successful going concern of those business as conservative we believe in fiscal prudence and discipline and appreciate that the government can not throw money at every problem and just make it okay we can not legislate to increase people living standard ultimately it come down to private investment business be creative and people work hard and generate wealth in the community as conservative we have to recognise that the market can on occasion fail and there can be such deterioration of condition in particular locality that government intervention for the long term be need would strongly argue that this be unique case where the condition in this community be such that it can not continue without government investment in short these community have be thrive in the past and they can do so again but only with government help not only be this community particularly important case and in need of regeneration and investment but would argue that bond street and the waterloo area have be miss out time and again when we talk about capital investment when blackpool council have ask my opinion on the levelling up process have state consistently for the past four year that this area should be an absolute priority for local and national government investment yet time and again level up bid have come forward to this government without this community be include that be not to say that be not thankful for the funding that have previously outline of course be those scheme be important and will help to create job but people in these community feel that they have be throw on the scrapheap and that local and national government do not care about what go on in their area and do not want to see it improve know that that be not the case from this government point of view and know that the government be work with blackpool council which after year of ignore this community have finally wake up over the past or month and promise to work with the government to try to come up with bespoke package for this area along the line of housing lead regeneration and improvement to the high street be so pleased that the government be work with blackpool council not just on this particular project but on many of the other initiative and programme that have already outline would like to think that have articulate why this community be special case for regeneration civic pride be so important in public life and be afraid that many people in this community have lose hope when people lose hope it be very difficult for they to get it back for four year have be tell people that regeneration money will come it be important that other area of blackpool get their fair share too but have say that regeneration money will come people be now expect the government and blackpool council to deliver on those promise know the minister understand the importance of people live in good housing the fact be that level up ultimately come down to improve somebody own ability to use their natural skill and flair to get on in life it be so important that the fundamental issue in these community poor housing be address through the partnership with blackpool council be lead to believe that thank to the hard work of not just this minister but some of his predecessor the business case for that project have be transfer to the treasury for sign off the purpose of this debate be to request that the minister and the secretary of state do everything that they can to continue their correspondence with the treasury and try to get the project over the line the people of bond street waterloo road revoe and central drive be look at the outcome of this debate with interest this be once in generation opportunity to get this community the funding that it so badly need this conservative government have be fantastic in stand by the people of blackpool for the next four year have every confidence that they will be able to get the project over the line and give the area new lease of life and some hope at long last thank the hon member for blackpool south scott benton for his speech and for raise this important issue will start where he end by refer specifically to his word on waterloo road and bond street

potential blackpool tourism economy alone be worth more than billion support in excess of job reply to this debate have remind with tinge of emotion of very enjoyable boyhood holiday that have with my grandmother in blackpool my memory be little hazy for reason that really can not recall with regard to attendance at successive tory party conference it must be something to do with the air that make the mind little fuzzy of course the famous scene of rita fairclough and alan bradley beam blackpool into the sit room of million of our fellow citizen leave an indelible impression on so many mind hopefully encourage people to use the tram but to be little careful when alight from they the hon gentleman speech and work have rightly remind we that blackpool should not be see just as holiday and tourist destination as delightful as that is and as important as it be for the economy it be home to many business and thousand of people with all their link housing education and health service need together with their aspiration for hope job security economic growth and well life for their child it have be restrain for too long by some deeply rooted societal challenge in health in housing and in skill and diverse investment and the hon gentleman set out some of those in his remark he make the case as he always do for the press need for regeneration and the dramatic statistic he use to underpin his argument only serve to illuminate that point still far that be why the government have be work in partnership with local leader to level up the town be grateful to the hon gentleman for reference the investment of around million in the town since the government take office that be phenomenal level of investment and hope it speak to the faith and confidence that this government have

the partnership work between government and blackpool thank he again for set out the opportunity for regeneration in waterloo road and bond street which be indeed interesting and exciting if we be to

potential we want to see more home safe home well home in well design neighbourhood that will help to attract and retain skilled resident in the town part of our approach be through legislation the renters reform bill which will apply decent home standard to the private rent sector for the first time this will ensure that tenant benefit from home that be safe and decent and will support the government ambition to reduce the number of non decent rent home by by and one hop that we will exceed that target we know of course that the majority of landlord already provide decent housing and good service for their tenant but there be always room for improvement the decent home standard will help landlord by simplify and clarify requirement and establish level playing field back up by consistent enforcement as the hon gentleman will know we be run pilot for the decent home standard in blackpool to improve standard in area that be in great need as part of our mission to halve the number of non decent home by the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend the member for redcar be in blackpool in january when he have the opportunity to see
