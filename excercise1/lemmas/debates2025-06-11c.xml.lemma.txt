oral answers to questions wales the secretary of state be ask devolution crown estate what recent discussion she have have with the welsh government on the potential merit of devolve the crown estate wish to start by pay tribute to sir billy boston the trailblaze welsh rugby league legend who receive knighthood this week it be fitting that sir billy be first recipient of knighthood for service to rugby league and commend those colleague who have campaign so hard for this well deserve award this government be totally focused on take maximum advantage of the opportunity that float offshore wind in the celtic sea present for wales the industry have the potential to create more than job and bring billion of investment into the uk economy in come year we do not support devolution of the crown estate as that would risk market fragmentation jeopardise those job and the significant investment that wales deserve in contrast to that recent research by the crown estate scotland have reveal that in one month period the crown estate help its tenant to generate an economic impact of billion and support almost job decade on from the devolution of the crown estate asset and revenue scottish voter be enjoy the benefit how can the secretary of state continue to justify withhold the same profit from wales when in scotland those profit be be put back into the scottish purse where they belong be afraid that will not take any lecture on the crown estate from the snp whose mismanagement of the scottish seabed have see scottish asset sell off on the cheap we be focus on do whatever it take to secure the more than job and billion of pound of investment that the crown estate can help to unlock for wales devolve the crown estate sound like such wonderful idea but the truth be that it really be not and the continued lobbying and loud chat about devolve the crown estate be jeopardise future investment in wales and job do the secretary of state agree my hon friend be absolutely right if we be to devolve the crown estate and introduce new entity that would risk market fragmentation complicate exist process and delay further development offshore jeopardise those job and that investment even if it could be do without risk the revenue that would not automatically lead to more money for the welsh government because any revenue they retain would likely be offset through reduction to the block grant as be the case in scotland meanwhile wales would no long benefit from crown estate asset and profit in england there be no long term vision torfaen council have vote unanimously to devolve the crown estate to wales which mean that every local authority in wales include every labour run council support the policy do the secretary of state really believe that the uk labour government know

balanced the right hon lady have obviously miss the interest rate cut the growth figure for early this year the strategic defence review billion go into local transport free school meal sizewell and

the shadow home secretary who think be then chief secretary to the treasury give the liz truss budget out of the leader of the opposition say that what be wrong with liz truss budget be not necessarily the package that be all right but the way it be sell the tories have learn absolutely nothing the prime minister love talk about liz truss why because he want to hide from his own economic record he be coward every time he stand at the dispatch box and talk about liz truss it be because he be scared of talk about his record and what be happen to the economy out there let we bring the prime minister back to the turn that he be run away from turn on policy that his mps go out defend time and again let we go through what be happen here one minute they say that it be right to take the winter fuel payment away because there might be run on the pound the next minute they say it be right to give it back this be laughable the prime minister stand there all puff up and self righteous why can he not just admit that he make mistake the conservatives leave billion black hole that we have to fill and that be why we take the right decision we have stabilise the economy which be why we have see four interest rate cut we have commit to the triple lock which the opposition say be unsustainable that is for most pensioner and we have have good quarter growth three week ago say that want

record but what about three trade deal record investment free school meal breakfast club social and affordable housing the defence review sizewell we could go on all morning but the chancellor will say even more in minute at the weekend the right hon lady say that she would be get well in the role she could start by apologise for the liz truss budget that would be well get well every week the prime minister get bad last order say to the member shout that if you think that be good look let tell you that it be very bad look think twice before you try to shout somebody down in that way call kemi badenoch last week the prime minister have to get his line from the russian embassy think we all know that he be get bad and what he do not want to talk about be how he be go to make the economy well that be what the people out there want to hear and he have get no answer his trade deal have unravel with the strategic defence review everyone out there be ask where the money be come from the fact be that he do not know how to balance the book the chancellor say that the winter fuel payment turn will not be fund through high borrowing so will the prime minister admit that it will be fund by put everybody taxis up think the right hon lady let slip on the matt forde programme the other day that she rehearse her fury for pmq so there be very good rehearsal this morning think she ask what we be do at the budget we put record investment in our nhs and our public service she come every week to carp on about national insurance but she do not stand there with the courage of her conviction and say that she will actually reverse it the reason she will not be because she will not stand up and say she be against the investment in the nhs she will not stand up and say she be against the investment in our public service we will all listen very carefully in just minute when the chancellor lay out more record investment as to whether the conservatives welcome it or whether they say they would not support it every week come here to tell the prime minister the truth the truth be that the economy be in spiral because labour all of they put up taxis which cut growth we all hear the prime minister he do not rule out tax rise so the government be go to have to put up taxis even more this be spiral if that be not bad enough this morning we hear that because of his terrible chagos deal mauritius be scrap income tax why on earth should the british taxpayer pay billion for tax cut in mauritius diego garcia be vital intelligence and strategic capability and it be absolutely clear that legal uncertainty would compromise it in very short order that be why the conservatives start the negotiation in relation to it and no responsible prime minister would let that happen we have secure the base for the long term that have be welcome by our ally by the us by nato and by australia new zealand and india it have be oppose by our adversary by russia china and iran in the second column we add reform follow putin and the tories follow reform the prime minister know this have nothing to do with national security it be his bad negotiating have have the security briefing it be bad deal before and it be still bad deal in half an hour the chancellor be go to stand up and tell we that everything be fine but the truth be that she have make bad choice bad choice that mean high inflation bad choice that have lead to low growth and bad choice that have mean that job have be lose every single month since labour come into office that be hundred of thousand of family who have lose their income in stoke grangemouth and luton those be their constituency and business across the country the chancellor have lose all her headroom she have fall out with the cabinet she be make unfunded spending commitment which she promise not to do be the truth not that we have get the wrong chancellor and the wrong priority the wrong choice that they make be make the right hon lady the leader of the opposition belate birthday greeting to you mr speaker it be wrong for any labour government to try to balance the book on the back of disabled people and no labour government should ever do it but it be what the prime minister will ask the house to do in just few week time many of we will not be able to go along with that because it will mean that people who need assistance to cut up their food to wash themselves to dress themselves and to go to the toilet will lose the personal independence payment that they currently receive they will lose that vital support this week the prime minister change direction on winter fuel payment will he do the same in relation to this matter and drop these disability benefit cut it be very important that we make the change to our welfare system it be not work and it need reform think everyone agree with that it do not work for anyone we will do this on principled basis namely that those who can work should work that those who want to work should be support so that they can do so and that we must protect those with the most severe disability who will never be able to work and we be do that by end reassessment and pay new premium call the leader of the liberal democrats let join other in wish you belate many happy return for yesterday mr speaker let also welcome the government sanction on two ministers in the netanyahu government ben gvir and smotrich the settler violence that they have incite against innocent palestinians on the west bank be intolerable and the government be right to act as it be carers week may pay tribute to the million of unpaid family carer across the country recognise the challenge that they face the last conservative government leave our health service on its knee we have hear report that the nhs will receive extra funding in the spending review and if it do we will support that but do the prime minister agree that no amount of money for the nhs will solve its crisis unless we also invest to fix care without pre empte the chancellor statement will he reassure that both social care and family carer will be give the priority they deserve in the spending review agree with the right hon gentleman that the health crisis create by the previous government can not opposition members groan but that be exactly how the country feel about the last year and the mess that they make of everything yes we do need to fix social care as well as put money into the nhs we be put record amount into the nhs which be the right thing to do and we be see the result we promise million extra appointment in the first year of labour government and we have deliver million so there will be that extra funding but let gently say to the right hon gentleman that while he welcome all the extra funding he can not at the same time simply say that he be against any way of raise the money for the funding there be an incompatibility there the prime minister know that he have fair and well way of fund nhs investment and regret the fact that he do not answer my question about care but let we move on the prime minister be right to increase defence spending and later we will hear about the difficult choice that the chancellor have have to make partly to fund that defence expenditure but there be freeze russian asset worth billion in the uk right now billion that could be use to stop putin war machine and to boost britain defence industry even fast at the summit this weekend will the prime minister seek an agreement to seize those frozen russian state asset and use they to support ukraine as the right hon gentleman know that be an issue that be be consider but it be complicated and there be great many countervail factor that need to be carefully balance in any decision we be talk to ally about it but do not want to pretend to the house that there be an easy answer on this because there be not more job cheap bill that be our promise on net zero if we can not meet those goal we must consider our approach in pembrokeshire we have proud industrial history root in oil and gas and an incredibly exciting opportunity in respect of float offshore wind in the celtic sea can the prime minister assure that he be committed to just transition that protect and create job thank my hon friend for raise this believe this government must seize the opportunity of net zero for work people create good skilled job and take they off the rollercoaster of volatile fossil fuel market under past government hard work community have their pride and their job rip away and we will never do that in relation to transition we have already see billion of investment in energy and renewable and the cbi datum show that job in wales be link to clean energy want to see more of that both the conservatives and reform be against it with your indulgence mr speaker will briefly pay tribute to the police service of northern ireland for tackle the public disorder in northern ireland over the last two night with over police officer injure be sure the whole house will want to join in that and in condemn the racist violence whether it be the cardiac scandal at the royal victoria hospital in belfast the cervical smear scandal at the southern trust the covid bereaved family or the crash of chinook all of which have impact my constituent in lagan valley the common thread here be that family simply want the truth but they be let down by institution at every cut and turn will this government urgently introduce duty of candour bill and ensure that it reflect what the hillsborough law now campaigner and family have fight so very hard for may start with the important point that the hon lady make about ballymena utterly condemn the violence that we see overnight in ballymena and other part of northern ireland include against psni officer it be absolutely vital that the psni be give the time it need to investigate the incident concern rather than face mindless attack as it seek to bring peace and order to keep people safe the northern ireland secretary be in touch with the psni and the executive and be be keep update in relation to that in relation to the tragic case that the hon lady mention thank she for raise they it be important that we have legal duty of candour and we will be introduce that because as she say there must be the truth here base on all people be deal with on the basis of dignity fairness and accountability in the word of the former israeli prime minister what we be witness in gaza be the indiscriminate limitless cruel and criminal killing of civilian more than people have be kill and child have be shoot while queue for bread grow number of genocide scholar include lead israeli academic believe that genocide be take place under international law we have duty to prevent genocide serve on the un mission in kosovo we act to stop mass kill there what be the difference now will the prime minister please intervene immediately to alleviate human suffering and take step to recognise the state of palestine my hon friend will have see the statement we make yesterday and the action that we be take with ally the humanitarian situation be dreadful and distressing and the scene that we have witness outside aid distribution centre be frankly heartbreaking more aid into gaza be need at volume and speed and israel plan for aid delivery be inadequate and insufficient what be need be for the un and other agency to deliver that aid accord to well establish mechanism and israel must allow this we be work with ally to do all that we can to make this happen as well as to get the hostage out they have be hold for very long time and desperately need return to ceasefire there be significant concern regard the potential job loss at spirit aerosystems that stem from the deal with airbus will the prime minister intervene to bring all the main player the union the business secretary and the secretary of state for northern ireland around the table to ensure that these job be protect especially consider that the scale of the issue be akin to the challenge face by british steel there be also an issue for northern ireland business with the outworking of the northern ireland protocol and the windsor framework can the prime minister give reassurance that he be work to resolve all those issue be grateful to the hon member for raise this important case of spirit aerosystems in northern ireland know how important it be for the workforce have visit they myself on more than one occasion airbus decision to expand uk operation be good news for the sector and testament to world class manufacturing expertise and want to see those high skilled job protect the northern ireland secretary have meet airbus the trade union and assembly representative to discuss the good outcome the minister for industry be continue engagement with stakeholder and we will do everything we can in relation to this situation be grateful to he for raise it will the prime minister join in condemn decision take by the transport minister of the previous government who turn their back on promise to deliver new train station at beam park which derail growth in my

statement to the house call the shadow chancellor this spending review be not worth the paper it be write on because the chancellor have completely lose control this be the spend now tax later review because the right hon lady know that she will need to come back here in the autumn with yet more taxis and cruel summer of speculation await how can we possibly take this chancellor seriously after the chaos of the last month we be assure at the election that labour plan involve barely any additional spending or borrowing now the chancellor parade she largesse with hundred of billion in additional spending over this parliament the initial profile for that spending be of course significantly front loaded but the chancellor now expect we to believe that she will let spending rise by only year there be no chance whatsoever of that happen for the lesson of the last year have be that when the going get tough the right hon lady blink she present herself as the iron chancellor but what we have see be the tinfoil chancellor flimsy and ready to fold in the face of the slight pressure she say she would not fiddle her fiscal rule then she do she say that she would not make any unfunded commitment with the humiliation of the winter fuel turn she just have she look business leader in the eye and say no more taxis but we all know what happen next and we all know what be come in the autumn her own back benchers her cabinet colleague labour trade union paymaster and even the prime minister himself have all see that she be weak weak weak they can smell the blood they will be back for more and they will get it these spending plan be fantasy and be it not the truth that the chancellor have to maintain this fiction because she have leave herself no room for manoeuvre she be constantly teeter on the edge of blow her fiscal rule which she have already change to allow even more borrowing the only way she can claim to be meet her rule be by pretend that she can control spending over the come year but let we look at the record so far borrow in the last financial year come out billion above even the office for budget responsibility march forecast and high than the plan she inherit from the conservatives for someone so keen on borrow the chancellor seem strangely reticent even to use the word indeed ministers bizarrely tell we that it be labour fiscal rule themselves that have generate investment the reality be little more straightforward they have loosen the fiscal rule so they can borrow more they borrow and borrow and borrow allow the national debt to continue to rise higher every single year while ministers pretend that it be not there will be an eye water billion of additional borrowing in this parliament compare with the plan set out in the last conservative budget with billion more to be spend on debt interest alone in fact if the chancellor have retain our fiscal labour member may laugh but if she have retain our fiscal rule as she say she would before the election the obr have confirm that she would be break they right now our country be now vulnerable to even the small change in the bond market should we face sudden external shock we have no fiscal firepower leave with which to respond all thank to the right hon lady choice so can ask the chancellor will she be open about what she have do will she admit that she have make conscious choice to borrow more and to accept high debt do she accept that this mean interest rate and mortgage will be high than they would otherwise have be as the obr itself have say give that she continue to claim that she have bring stability to the public finance can ask she what on earth her definition of stability be the chancellor must be delighted that she do not have to face new obr forecast today because if she do she would have to set out how she would fund her humiliating turn on winter fuel payment have already blow the saving on buy off her trade union paymaster last year she say this week that there be still work to do to ensure the sum always add up from the person in charge of the nation finance that be hardly reassuring you do not need to have work at the bank of england for decade to know that that pitiful utterance be unlikely to soothe the market so can the chancellor confirm categorically that there will be no additional borrowing to pay for this chaotic reversal and if that be the case can she explain how on earth it can be pay for without raise taxis can she explain why last summer apparently to avoid run on the pound this measure be so urgent that pensioner have to be leave in the cold over the last winter what exactly have change because it certainly have not be make possible by an improvement in the economy or the public finance which the institute for fiscal studies say this week be both in bad state now than when labour come into office if we have an obr forecast we might also get some answer on how the government intend to find billion to abolish the two child benefit cap which we be lead to believe be imminent another addition to the ballooning welfare bill another expensive surrender to the labour leave and we would certainly get the obr assessment of the economic outlook follow the tariff change that the right hon lady know full well be come meanwhile her deluge of taxis and regulation have leave business confidence at record low cost people their livelihood only yesterday we see the late evidence of that figure for last month show that the number of people on payroll fall by more than after already fall by in april unemployment be up by more than since labour come to office the right hon lady may trumpet extra spending today but be it not the simple truth that she have trash the economy and leave no contingency in the face of highly volatile global outlook be it not the reality that the chancellor know she will have to come back in the autumn with more tax rise to fund these plan or can she assure we right now that this be not the case yes or no we know that the deputy prime minister have helpfully provide she with an entire brochure of tax rise that she will no doubt be peruse over the summer the corbynist catalogue can the chancellor confirm that as promise the income tax threshold will not be freeze at the budget move she herself say would hurt work people what about the uncertainty in the departmental spending plan that the chancellor have set out today can she assure we that these plan will not be top up and that no backroom deal have be cut with disgruntle cabinet ministers can she assure we that the capital allocation announce today will actually be spend on capital and will not be divert in year as she have do in the past to day to day budget to play more game with her fiscal rule the chancellor have have to impose settlement on the home secretary because this spending review will not deliver for our hard work police officer across the country instead the home office budget get squander on asylum cost because this government simply do not have plan on illegal migration as the defence secretary have admit the government have lose control of our border small boat crossing be up by on the same point last year on energy at time when business up and down the country be struggle with high energy cost the chancellor have choose today to fund the energy secretary vanity project such as gb energy and although we welcome the announcement on expand nuclear capacity the scale of ambition be downgrade on the commitment make previously by the conservatives labour barely mention farming in its manifesto and now we know why it be not enough to have hit the farmer of our country with family farm tax today what we see in black and white be choice to make further cut to the vital grant on which many farmer rely this be huge betrayal of our farming community and something that many labour mp in rural area will have to go back to their constituency later this week to explain on defence we will always welcome any additional investment in our armed force and capability though note nothing be say about when will be achieve all we hear be that intelligence service spending be to be include in defence spending to flatter the number we leave labour fully fund plan that they dither over for year but now what we get be the chancellor own black hole on defence spending and the lack of timeline on when we will achieve instead we get billion bill for the chagos surrender money that should have go to our brave armed force rather than as be be report fund low taxation in mauritius the first tax cut for which this chancellor have be responsible be in mauritius we would have make different choice we would not have kill growth with huge tax rise and new regulation we would not have talk down our economy and the great business up and down our country we would be focus on efficiency and productivity in the public sector not hand out pay rise with no string attach we would be get grip on welfare labour cancel our plan for fundamental reform to health and disability benefit that would have see few people on long term sickness benefit that be disgrace instead of proper reform to pip the government own plan be rush cost cut exercise so rush they even have to change they after they be announce their own back benches be in full revolt yet again the government talk tough but there be no substance the right hon lady have no grip she have no clue the market and the public see chancellor completely out of her depth have blow her headroom and more from her budget in the autumn she be force into an emergency budget in march to scrabble around to try to repair the damage today she come before we again with yet another fantastical tale that she know will have completely fall apart come the autumn we be not leave with strong foundation as she would have we believe but rather another dose of that hallmark for which her action have make she so renowned uncertainty and failure so there the right hon lady sit powerless to resist her disillusioned mps and her panic prime minister like cork on the tide the drumbeat for turn pound in her ear yet her tone today suggest that all be well the sunlit upland await what hopeless conceit masterclass in delusion inflation be up unemployment be up growth be mark down business and household be hurt investor be flee in their drove the bond market vigilante circle and here we have the chancellor who refuse to listen not only tinfoil but tin eare too let be clear it be work people and business who will pay the price come the autumn with yet more taxis to pay for her weakness and her failure we can not afford this spending review and for many the grow conclusion be that we can not afford this chancellor will address the shadow chancellor specific point in moment but want to start by acknowledge the progress he have make after all it have be quite week for he last thursday he give speech say that it will take time for his party to win back trust on the economy today he show we how far he and his party have to go to achieve that want to give he some credit for last week analysis he say that the conservative party be see to have fail and he be right he say that the last conservative government put at risk the very stability which conservatives have always say must be carefully protect and agree with he interruption order need to be able to hear and be sure our constituent also want to hear the shadow chancellor say the credibility of the uk economic framework be undermine by spend billion with no proper plan for how this would be pay for could not put it well myself he could have go lot far for example he could not even bring himself to mention liz truss by name stride by name baby step by nature but at least he have make start he also speak about the death of what we might call the age of thoughtfulness speak of the death of thoughtfulness let turn to the shadow chancellor response to the spending review he welcome our nuclear investment of billion but he say it be not enough he welcome our defence investment of billion but he say it be not enough he and his party oppose the decision that this government have take to make those announcement possible by vote against the budget in october you can not spend the money if you will not raise the money that be lesson from liz truss that he have already forget the shadow chancellor complain about the level of investment that have announce ignore the fact that the reason this investment be so important be because his party oversee year of cratere investment stagnate wage and public service collapse let remind he of what say the tories fiscal rule guarantee neither stability nor investment and that be why change they so we can get stability and investment all their fiscal rule enable be they to crash the economy and the work people of britain will never forgive they for do that the conservative set themselves against investment in the renewal of britain they set themselves against nhs investment free school meal investment in skill investment in carbon capture and storage investment in transport in our town and city investment in everything that we have set out today and yet the british people vote for that investment the right hon gentleman say that the home office budget involve an increase in asylum cost it do not asylum cost be come down under this labour government because we be deport more people and get they out of hotel he say we be cut police spending we be increase it by year in real term we have have no apology for the damage the conservatives do to our economy and our public service interest rate have be cut four time in the past month gdp be the fast growing of all economy in the first quarter of the year business confidence be rise more people be in work record investment have be make in britain real wage have increase more in month than they do in year of conservative government the national living wage have increase give million work people pay rise and we have do all that without increase taxis on work people those be the choice we have make that be the difference we be make in the spending review today we set out the spending that we announce in the budget last year and in the spring statement not penny more not penny less say in the budget and in the spring statement that public service must now live within the mean that we have set and we have achieve that there will be budget later this year and in that budget we will set out all the fiscal plan in the round but we have already draw line under the tory mismanagement with tax rise last year and we will never have to repeat budget like that again because we will never have to clean up after the mess that the conservatives make again the reason that this labour government have spend their first year fix the foundation of our economy and stabilise our public finance be because it be what we have to do the government of which the shadow chancellor be part of leave an unenviable legacy which be why his party be in his own word in difficult place we have make our choice we be remove barrier to growth which be untouched by the conservatives in their year in office strengthen britain security with the big real term increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war which the conservatives do not do in their year in office bring our health service into the century after year of conservative neglect invest in britain renewal to repair the damage do by the conservatives in their year in office and in stark contrast to the conservatives year of chaos waste and decline we be deliver on the priority of the british people call the chair of the treasury committee congratulate my right hon friend on deliver this spending review the first zero base review in very long time it be vital that as taxpayer the citizen be look carefully at their spending in this cost of living crisis that government do that too we look forward to have the chief secretary to the treasury before the committee in two week time to consider the review in more detail note from the figure that the chancellor have make good fist of ensure that departments have more than they do under the conservatives in many case and welcome her work to deliver on tackle child poverty scourge on our society note from my brief glimpse however that there be small increase for the ministry of housing communities and local government than there would have be there be the billion over decade for affordable social housing child live in poverty also face poverty of situation in many case will she expand on how she and the deputy prime minister will deliver that money to provide the social housing that so many child in poverty desperately need appreciate my hon friend welcoming of the breakfast club free school meal and the capping of school uniform cost which will help family live in poverty the free school meal will as she know lift child out of poverty she mention the affordable home grant which will have its big ever increase we have set that budget for year to give certainty to the sector so that it understand what be available in addition we have set out some social rent change to give certainty to the sector to invest for the future call the liberal democrat spokesperson it have be almost year since labour sweep to power with the promise of change but we be still not see the scale of ambition need to turn the country around we welcome the announcement of investment in the nhs but it will not work unless the government invest in social care too we welcome the investment in infrastructure but it will not work unless the government invest in skille up the workforce that we need to build it cut billion in real term from departmental budget seem unnecessary when the government could instead go for growth and get much deep trading relationship with europe move that could raise an extra billion year for the public purse as long as the government fail to truly tackle the red tape and trading barrier block british business the government grip on economic growth be more akin to handbrake than an accelerator the last conservative government leave our nhs on its knee on their watch waiting list be soar hospital be crumble and our high street healthcare be hollow out can the chancellor confirm that this funding will deliver the extra gps need to guarantee everyone an appointment within seven day or within hour if the matter be urgent can she confirm that this funding will bring dentist back into the nhs and put an end to dental desert will she promise that this funding will mean that every cancer patient start treatment within day will she promise that the government will meet the prime minister own pledge for of routine operation to take place within week will she and the health secretary they be sit side by side set up crumble hospital taskforce to look at creative funding idea bring construction date forward and put an end to the vicious cycle and false economy of delay rebuild lead to rise repair cost as we see under the previous government then of course there be the elephant in the nhs waiting room the crisis in our social care service the chancellor know the health and social care secretary know this whole parliament know today investment in the nhs will be like pour water into leaky bucket if hospital can not discharge patient who be well enough to leave because there be no care worker to help they recover at home the fair pay agreement that the chancellor talk about be of course welcome but it be barely baby step and it be nowhere near enough to bring social care back from the brink at bare minimum we need high minimum wage for our care worker to stop the sector haemorrhage staff to other sector when will the chancellor finally recognise that we will never fix the nhs if we do not fix social care too will the government finally act with urgency by commit to conclude the social care review by the end of this year not in three year time on housing we warmly welcome the government investment in social home will they now commit to the liberal democrats target of build social home every year other public service be cry out for investment too our community need proper neighbourhood police to feel safe our farmer need fair support payment to keep put food on our table and people of all age deserve access to training and skill to build their future and to power our economy forward that be why it be so disappointing that the chancellor have today make thing so difficult for our public service by cut unprotected budget by billion yes we know she be face with the fallout from the most reckless out of touch conservative government in recent memory but be responsible be not just about make tough decision it be about have the moral courage to make the right one yet this government seem determined not to adopt the one policy that could put rocket booster on our economy and raise billion for our public service proper trade deal with europe new bespoke customs union with the european union could boost our gdp by more than secure additional revenue to the tune of billion year huge boost to business and our struggle public service if the chancellor can turn on the winter fuel payment thank to skinny eu trade pact worth just in extra gdp just imagine how many more turn she could perform with proper trade deal worth ten time as much we liberal democrats strongly support the allocation of of gdp on defence but we want ministers to go far and fast to bolster our national security in today uncertain world will the chancellor agree to cross party talk in which we can work together to set pathway to of gdp well ahead of will the government use some of today investment to reverse the conservatives irresponsible cut of troop will she ensure that invest in our national security become lever for economic growth put much great emphasis on british steel producer and sme as we scale up our defence and ensure that british start up can use defence innovation for the public good before conclude must thank the chancellor for finally complete the world slow turn on the unfair winter fuel payment cut now that she have turn will she do the right thing and backdate the payment for all those who lose out on support last winter but who be now eligible under the new rule and now that she have turn once will she make it hat trick and also change course on the pip and carer allowance cut perhaps she might even look again at the growth crush job tax and the other change affect our high street small business and family business and consider instead the fairer way of raise the same amount of revenue that we liberal democrats have set out time and again ask the big bank social medium giant and online gambling company to start pay their fair share of tax after year of chaos and incompetence under the last conservative government this be unique opportunity to draw line under the social care crisis squeeze budget and sluggish economic growth strongly urge the chancellor to ignore those who talk down britain economic potential to rip up the red tape hold british business back and to strike properly ambitious trade deal with europe that will turbocharge our economy and bring in billion to rebuild our public service the government say that their no mission be growth that be the way to deliver it thank the hon lady for her comment know she have not have chance to look at the figure yet but it be not right to say that there be real term cut to public service public service spending be increase by year on average over the course of the spending review will start on investment in the nhs and social care as set out in my speech we have already deliver more gps and put billion into the nhs in the first phase of the spending review note that that compare with the billion that the liberal democrats say they be go to put into the nhs in their manifesto we have already put billion in and we will put more money in today and in every year of this parliament the new hospital programme be be roll out think the health secretary meet just last week with member of parliament who be have hospital improvement in their local community include many liberal democrat mps so the hon lady should be aware that we be make improvement to the fabric of our hospital as well as invest in technology scanner and so on to improve productivity in our health service with regard to social care as the hon lady know we be introduce the fair pay agreement that be something that the health secretary and my right hon friend the deputy prime minister be very much committed to as the hon lady will know when she look at the document we have increase local government spending power so that we can put more money into social care in addition louise casey be do her review into the future of social care we be go big on infrastructure we announce billion more in the budget last year and another billion in the spring statement and we be back that up with skill as set out in my speech and as be detail in the spending review document we be make the big ever investment in young people skill so that they can access the new job that be be create in defence house building and other infrastructure on red tape and back business it be little bit ironic that the liberal democrats vote against the planning and infrastructure bill yesterday yet they come to the house today say that they want to do away with red tape and go for growth well we want to go for growth and that be why we take that legislation through parliament perhaps the hon lady will ask her party lords to vote for growth in the other place we have do trade deal with the us india and the eu think the liberal democrats oppose the trade deal with the us but apparently they now think that trade deal be the way to go well so do we that be why my right hon friend the business and trade secretary have three of they help our automotive sector our steel sector and our farming community we will use defence spending to support growth the defence secretary and have be very clear about that and as set out in my speech to make britain defence industrial superpower say gently to the liberal democrats and the hon lady that if we want to support investment in public service we have to increase the tax rise to get there they vote against the national insurance increase which be what have enable we to make the investment that have set out today the hon lady say that she want wealth tax we change inheritance tax and the liberal democrats vote against it we introduce vat on private school and the liberal democrats vote against it either they be serious about invest in public service in which case they need to back the tax increase or they want to go down the route of the magic money tree conservative party and just borrow more to pay for thing on the winter fuel allowance we have make our choice clear we will keep the mean test but it will be pay to people with pension of less than think the liberal democrats want to make it universal benefit again indicate dissent okay that be just the tories well they need to explain how they would pay for it appreciate the fact that the hon lady welcome some of our policy but the job of the chancellor and the government be to ensure that the sum add up we make difficult decision last october but stand by those difficult decision without they today we would not have be able to make the investment we have make in school energy and our health service be proud of what we have achieve as government and be proud of the investment that we be put in today the warm home plan will mean healthy and warm home and will see low bill and create job in community right across the country it be very good plan especially for those face fuel poverty the last government home energy programme change every few month which mean that business could not plan and consumer have no confidence in it not to mention the scandalous misapplication of fix wall insulation will my right hon friend confirm that this be long term warm home plan that will deliver warm home and cut bill to the benefit of million of our constituent for year to come thank the chair of the energy security and net zero committee for that question warm home be big part of our plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and the money that we have put into the warm home plan today will mean that million more home can be retrofit with well boiler insulation and solar panel on average that take year off people bill not just for one year but for every year to come my hon friend be absolutely right what we have do today be set out five year package of capital investment because it be crucial that the industry be able to plan for the future and that young people be therefore willing to train up and business be willing to invest in apprenticeship that be why on all of our capital spending include the warm home plan we have set out five year plan my constituent in tenbury wells be seek fund for flood defence scheme they will have listen very closely to the chancellor remark today to hear her mention flood defence capital spending yet it be not mention in her speech can she confirm that the capital that will be allocate in the spending review period to flood defence will be as high in real term as it be in the previous parliament the hon lady know that we increase money for flood defence in the spending review in autumn last year because we know that there be no time to waste we have already increase that flood defence spending in addition to what the previous government be spend this spending review be good for britain business because it invest in the thing that british business need it invest in skill infrastructure and innovation cut red tape and support small firm can the chancellor clarify that this spending review will also open new era of energy abundance for our country the business and trade committee hear directly from the international monetary fund in washington yesterday that high energy cost be hold back growth that be consequence of the dither and delay from the conservatives who leave we with the high industrial energy cost in europe will the chancellor confirm to the house that we be consign that era to history my right hon friend be right we be back innovation skill and infrastructure because we be back british business we be also cut red tape as we do yesterday when we take the planning and infrastructure bill through the house make it easy to get thing build in britain again as we make the investment we want those job to come to britain include in the energy sector whether it be investment in small modular reactor sizewell carbon capture and storage or float offshore wind we will set out the industrial strategy in the next couple of week in which we will have more to say about energy cost for business thank the chancellor for engage productively in the discussion about sustainable budget for northern ireland for the willingness to negotiate far and for the recognition that our need level should be meet thank she for that engagement and for the allocation to northern ireland for specific community project that have be advance by we she have choose through this allocation to make budget available for the redevelopment of casement park she will know about the political nature of some of the concern around that redevelopment and that in all previous agreement in the executive these thing have be advance in balanced and non partisan way this government have choose to step into this issue in an unbalanced and partisan way as such in make financial transaction capital million over the course of the next spending period ask the chancellor to ensure that where there be need for investment in football as there be she return to the executive agreement of in balanced and non partisan way hope that she will not be find want thank the right hon gentleman for his question and the way in which he have put it be pleased to be able to announce the settlement for northern ireland in today spending review but also money through the ministry of housing communities and local government he mention casement park and we have put million in through this spending review will arrange for the right hon gentleman to meet either the northern ireland secretary or minister from my department to talk through what he want to see welcome the focus my right hon friend the chancellor have place on child and young people in this spending review with additional investment in child social care school and skill these announcement show the government commitment to improve the life chance of every child and my committee look forward to scrutinise the detail in the come week the chancellor will know that university be the life force of many local economy generate job improve skill and boost life chance yet number of our university be at the brink of insolvency the sector have be call for transformation fund to help university reform and secure sustainable future so can the chancellor confirm that she will work with cabinet colleague to ensure that no town or city have to face the calamity of university go bust thank my hon friend the chair of the education committee for her question appreciate she welcome the investment in child social care in skill and in school issue that she know and care passionately about in the spending review we be able to set out total of billion of investment in research and development much of it spend through our university and research institutes but be certain that the education secretary or the relevant minister will meet my hon friend to talk about the wide allocation from this spending review scientist at the uk health security agency at porton down make massive contribution to the welfare of our country in difficult time ten year ago the chancellor predecessor want to invest million in move to single science hub in harlow some million have already be spend and last year the national audit office say that it would cost billion to complete the move by three week ago have an adjournment debate in which be tell that today we would know the outcome of what be actually go to happen with this project can the chancellor explain what be happen with the future of the ukhsa at porton down be it go to move to harlow at massive expense six time the original estimate and year later than be estimate or can we save some money and use it for well investment in our public estate thank the right hon gentleman and member of the treasury select committee for his question we have make the allocation to the department of health and social care an annual uplift of billion and it will be up to the secretary of state to allocate that money but will make sure that he have hear the right hon gentleman question and that he get proper reply to he with billion investment into nuclear in derby billion into nuclear fusion in north nottinghamshire and half billion into steel suitable for use in the nuclear industry in sheffield my

industry we as government be proud to be able to step in and save british steel at scunthorpe and again thank my hon friend the member for scunthorpe but it be not just scunthorpe there be also opportunity in sheffield and port talbot because as we build this infrastructure whether it be tram and train nuclear power or submarine we want to use steel make in britain that be really exciting opportunity and the investment we be make in small modular reactor and fusion in nottinghamshire and derby create great opportunity for job that be why we be also make record investment in skill through the spending review so that young people in north east derbyshire and beyond can get access to the job that be be create call liz saville roberts diolch yn fawr iawn dirprwy lefarydd the announcement of just million year for the next year for welsh rail be labour flimsy fig leaf of an excuse for the multibillion and multi decade scandal that be the money announce today be only significant if it match what wales will continue to lose from all england only rail project up to now and in the future can the chancellor guarantee that from now on wales will receive the full billion consequential funding or will she admit that her announcement on welsh rail funding be nothing but smoke and mirror do not think million be not real money that money will be invest in the burns review station in addition we be put in million to make the coal tip safe maybe the right hon lady be not that concerned about that but know that plenty of welsh labour mp be wonder whether the chancellor can help want to write letter to my constituent and do not know which story should lead with whether it be the rapid investment in our nhs to get more doctor appointment the money for our police to get more police on the street the transport investment to build new train station or the money to give hungry child in my constituency free school meal could she help out only have one page what should start with my hon friend will want to leave space on the leaflet to remind his constituent that he be lobby for all those thing so that he can take the thank welcome the turn on the winter fuel payment of course do and lot of my constituent will do likewise but there be no respite in this spending review for farmer in scotland business owner in scotland gp surgery in scotland or the disabled in hospice in scotland despite what the chancellor say there have also be real term cut to the home office foreign office and local government in this spending review the chancellor be an open book she play roulette with the economy but would not encourage she to play poker any time soon because she mention reform and the hon member for clacton nigel farage in her speech more time than she mention scotland what disgrace she mention that she have finally get around to acorn but without figure attach what funding be she go to allocate for acorn we know that if it be merseyside or teesside there be billion for they how much for acorn do mention the snp question why the snp do not support defence investment in scotland but can mention it again if the hon gentleman would like to why have the snp let down the people of scotland with rise hospital waiting list why have the snp let down people in scotland with more drug death why have the snp let people down time and again we be put money into acorn and into defence investment and we be give record settlement to the snp government but hopefully they will not be there for much long thank my right hon friend the chancellor for prioritise affordable housing which be overdue that extra investment will go long way towards address the spiral broken housing system that have push so many people into poverty last year record household face homelessness an increase of over in one year alone we see so many family place in what we call temporary accommodation but it be not temporary five year or more be far from temporary child be travel for hour to get to school family do not have space in which to grow up and we have lose decade of build the social home that we need join with the like of shelter and the national housing federation in welcome the investment in affordable housing and the certainty of year rent settlement but we need more of these measure and we need to build truly social home can the chancellor confirm what proportion of social rent home will form the backbone of the affordable home programme to get those family into safe secure and stable home thank my hon friend for her campaigning on housing and homelessness which be big challenge in many of our constituency include her in vauxhall and camberwell green we want to work closely with local council and the mayor of london to build the affordable home that we desperately need in the capital city where house price and rent be still far too high for so many family look forward to work with my hon friend on just that the billion of pound that have be announce by the chancellor be very big rise and the public accounts committee look forward to scrutinise that expenditure be sure it will be welcome by those who receive it to ensure we be get value for money but can the chancellor explain to the house how it will be fund because debt and tax be at record level can british worker look forward to summer of expect more tax increase look forward to that scrutiny but the hon gentleman will know that the allocation we have make today be base on the tax increase we make in the budget last year we be not spend single penny more or single penny less than the money we set out in the autumn budget and the spring statement welcome the significant transport investment that the chancellor have announce in the north and in the city region that be help through her change to the green book but when will the place base business case be review so that those area can start plan for the local transport initiative that they have wait so long for hope that my hon friend can already see the impact of our change attitude and our change perspective at the treasury with our put this record investment of billion which we announce last week into eight mayoral combined authority to well connect town and city because of the change we have make we have be able to put more money into the trans pennine route upgrade and the midland hub as well as significant investment in train in wales my community in westmorland will be outrage by reduction in farm funding we be perplexed because we be tell to expect decision today on the vital scheme to dual the from penrith to scotch corner that be crucial to east west connectivity to the northern economy and to save life there be no mention in the statement or in the accompany document at all will the chancellor confirm that the upgrade will take place the allocation have now be make to the department for transport we have not set out every project that that will fund but be sure the transport secretary will come to this house or the relevant select committee in due course thank the chancellor of the exchequer for put her faith in young people and the future with investment in the ai nuclear and defence opportunity that young people in scotland deserve alongside billion for training and apprenticeship meanwhile in my constituency fife college have recently warn about course cut and campus closure thank to the mismanagement of the scottish budget by the snp do she agree that the good way to get young people the opportunity they deserve in defence nuclear and other industry be with scottish labour government and anas sarwar as first minister we see in the by election last week how desperate the people of scotland be for change after two decade of snp so call leadership we be invest in training and apprenticeship in this spending review and very much hope that the snp will match that investment in scotland the chancellor supposedly inherit black hole and she have dig crater into which public confidence and business confidence be plunge the truth be that job have disappear since the blunder budget despite all the noise we hear from those on the government benches the reality be that government spending be completely out of control inflation be up unemployment be up government borrowing be up and the cost of government borrowing be up the only thing that be go down be job and gdp have some good news for the chancellor however the council that we control be already identify saving of hundred of million of pound she may want to learn some lesson that be why reform be lead in the poll note recently that the hon member say on podcast that he want to cut government spending by billion but that would mean get rid of the whole of the nhs and the whole of the defence budget we have increase spending by billion to invest in our school our hospital our transport and our defence know that reform be soft on defence soft on worker right and want to privatise our nhs do not think those be the priority of the british people reform economic policy appear to have be cook up after heavy night at moe bar in the simpsons in year the snp have fail to invest in glasgow transport infrastructure we have no airport rail link and no parkhead station we do not even have lift at bridgeton station contrast that with my right hon friend the chancellor firm commitment to transport there be also billion extra for the scottish government to sort out the snp nhs waiting list record investment in the defence industry and the clyde to defend

that in the deal that we do with the european union we secure defence industrial partnership with the eu across the country people see their health service severely overstretch school headteacher face have to make cut and of course the most vulnerable people in society face cut to disability benefit accord to the bbc analysis of the chancellor statement her figure will mean sharp decline in budget for public service after be not the statement matter of smoke and mirror will the chancellor instead consider the grow call for wealth tax on the ultra rich so that she can raise the extra ten of billion that be need to support our public service and restore much need pride and hope in britain it be difficult to tell whether the hon gentleman support the spending review and the additional money that we be put into public service or be against it the settlement for the nhs mean real term growth year and for the police the figure be year there be also an increase in per pupil funding as well as real term increase in the school budget so be not exactly sure what the hon gentleman complaint be there be terrible dangerous coal slip in my constituency last autumn and the coal tip safety funding announce today be hugely welcome it be great to see our labour government stand up for wales look forward however may ask the chancellor please to review the miner staff superannuation scheme hard work family deserve fairness in their retirement and be sure that she will give they fair hearing be very pleased that we be able to make this multi year commitment on coal tip safety the government provide money for this in last year spending review but that be for just one year and today we have be able to give certainty that money will be available for the vital work that be necessary thank my hon friend for welcome it it be shame that plaid cymru do not my hon friend have be staunch supporter of reform of the miner pension scheme we make reform in the budget last year but will ensure that the relevant minister meet he to discuss what more we can do to secure fair pension for miner in retirement london members be hop to hear more about infrastructure investment in the capital today we be look for spending on the bakerloo line extension and spending to deal with the croydon bottleneck even dare to dream that hammersmith bridge might one day be fix but all we have hear from the chancellor be her reiterate support for the expansion of heathrow airport as she will know heathrow expansion be oppose by every political party in the capital and by the mayor of london it be not welcome the negligible economic benefit of expand heathrow do not compensate for the massive environmental and noise impact that expansion will have on many people in the capital particularly my constituent may ask the chancellor to look again at her support for heathrow and consider the great merit of many other infrastructure project across london the hon lady start that question want to be builder and end it by be blocker suppose that be not surprising give that the liberal democrats vote against the planning and infrastructure bill yesterday while we labour members support it because we want to get britain building and to create prosperity and wealth in all our community in today spending review we have provide an integrated settlement for the mayor of london and multi year settlement for transport for london we have also support expansion at city airport and we have an in principle commitment to expansion and second runway at gatwick this government be back london but most importantly we be government for the whole country that be why we have announce significant investment across the uk today which be much need the sdlp priority continue to be fund northern ireland on the basis of need and urge the government to take focused action so that we can have sustainable public service and hopefully stable politic that will start to deliver for health and education and deal with the squeeze in housing and childcare warmly welcome the funding allocation for casement park which represent much more than just stadium it be home for ulster gaelic athletic association to match the wonderful home that we have for soccer and rugby in northern ireland and it be flagship venue for west belfast and an economic opportunity for the whole city do the chancellor agree that while there be way to go to secure the funding for the stadium that the gaa hundred of thousand of supporter and volunteer deserve the onus be now on the stormont executive on sinn féin the democratic unionist party and the alliance party to get move end decade of dither and delay and finally get casement park build this government have provide million in the spending review today but we have also hope do much more for northern ireland provide settlement that be record since devolution as well as significant investment in our defence sector northern ireland have proud history of produce for the uk defence need of course welcome the continue support for scunthorpe steelwork but may gently remind the chancellor that that support come seven month after first raise the issue in the house and we then have the panic of the saturday sit in april the chancellor mention support for the vike carbon capture and storage project for which again have lobby for long time can she give little more detail about the timeframe thank the hon gentleman for welcome what we do with british steel in scunthorpe know that he have be strong voice advocate for british steel there unlike some of our late arrival in another party as for viking ccs be very pleased to announce that funding today along with the acorn investment in aberdeenshire the energy secretary will set out in due course the timing and the money available but after our investment in ccs in merseyside and teesside at the end of last year we be now in position to provide second tranche in aberdeen and also in the humber thank the chancellor for all her commitment to spend on education health and transport but thank she particularly for the billion that she have commit to housing in my constituency thousand of family be still wait for social home and about people be now on bolton housing waiting list may ask whether some of that money could be use to build more social housing in area like mine so that we can meet the need of our constituent my hon friend speak powerfully about the desperate need for more social and affordable home in all our community include those in bolton that multi year commitment and billion of investment will help we to build the social and affordable home that our country desperately need and the ministry of housing communities and local government will work with local authority to bring forward those plan and get britain build the home that we need what be most interesting about the spending review be what be not mention there be no mention of the river thames scheme no mention of our river no mention of the animal and plant health agency in new haw and no mention of improvement to rail despite the nationalisation of south western railway in fact there be almost no mention at all of the south east despite the chancellor say that this spending review for the whole uk however she have effectively confirm the third runway at heathrow despite there be no local engagement may invite the chancellor to come to runnymede and weybridge to meet people and see if their priority be indeed hers as she claim it be difficult to understand exactly what the conservative critique of this spending review be the shadow chancellor say that we should spend less but the hon gentleman have just ask we to spend more if hon member on either side of the house want to spend more they need to say where the money would come from be not sure that he have an answer to that welcome the chancellor statement and her steely determination to ensure that everyone in darlington be well off particularly welcome the capital infrastructure project which be essential not only for sovereign security but for regional growth do she agree that these project will be transformational for engineering and fabricate sme in my constituency many of which be set up and be staff by incredibly highly skilled people who find themselves out of job when the last government turn their back on british foundation industry my hon friend be absolutely right what this spending review do through its investment in infrastructure be create job in our supply chain for small business in community right across our country the investment in some of our foundational industry such as steel offer real opportunity for good unionised job that pay decent wage and be really proud to be able to set out that investment and the job that young people in darlington and around the country will be able to access because of the choice we have make today as the chancellor know our economy will only escape its difficult place if we raise economic productivity on the treasury committee introduce the chancellor to london business school paolo surico research on how use public and especially defence spending can help we to do that in the spring statement the government use professor surico research to upgrade long term gdp forecast by billion year that be how we pay for it strongly welcome the government commitment to invest in public in the spending review but how will the chancellor follow through to ensure that the will be use to crowd in and stimulate public investment especially from the more innovative high tech start up and venture capital firm which be necessary to realise the potential of professor surico research every of government investment in crowd in of private investment and return of benefit to the wide economy that be why we have put billion of investment into over the course of this spending review madam deputy speaker be sure that your constituent my constituent the constituent of my hon friend the member for shipley anna dixon and indeed the chancellor constituent will greatly welcome the billion for new tram and new bus station in bradford as well as the billion for social and affordable housing which be much need however the chancellor will know that over half of all child in my constituency be still grow up in poverty which be true of many hon member constituency child poverty be not statistic it be national disgrace it be direct result of year of ideological austerity under the conservatives today statement be step in the right direction particularly with the announcement that half million more child will be eligible for free school meal but frankly it do not go far enough will the chancellor tell what further measure this government will announce to alleviate and finish child poverty include scrap the two child limit which continue to put thousand of child into poverty appreciate my hon friend welcome for the billion for the west yorkshire combine authority which will help pay for mass transit to connect leeds and bradford but also kirklees and calderdale in today statement we be able to provide money for free school meal for child lift out of poverty as well as continue to roll out breakfast club and the warm home programme which will help insulate property and bring down bill for million of family in addition we have increase the national living wage by nearly and the employment rights bill will ensure that more people have security and dignity at work all part of our plan for change and lift child and family out of poverty high speed own vast swathe of the staffordshire countryside in fact it own third of all the property in the village of hopton which be have an enormous impact on resident and cause an enormous blight could the chancellor set out for the house and for so many resident right across staffordshire when we will know whether farmer be go to have their land back and whether village will be able to return to normal life with people move into the empty house be sure that the right hon gentleman have apologise to his constituent for the total mess that the conservatives make of we be fix their mess and get grip of the project cost frankly it be astounding for the right hon gentleman to raise give the mess they make of it after almost year of an snp government in scotland we have fifer on an nhs waiting list and grow gap in educational achievement between kid from the rich and poor area after less than one year of labour uk government we be deliver record funding for scotland fall energy bill pay rise for fifers new defence job in fife and follow an announcement that will be warmly welcome by my constituent today new investment in the renewal of kirkcaldy town centre and the potential of our amazing seafront do the chancellor agree that this be the difference labour government can make the work that this labour government be do will reduce inequality we be give pay rise to million of worker and create defence job that pay decent wage and gb energy will be headquarter in scotland today have be able to announce additional investment in the seafront in my hon friend constituency which will bring economic benefit an nhs fit for the future congratulate the chancellor and the health secretary on the investment in the health service in england give the money that have be allocate to northern ireland will the chancellor encourage the executive to provide the same investment in the health service in northern ireland the executive have be work with single year budget since do the chancellor agree that this sr allow they to set multi year recurrent budget that allow the transformation of health service and other public service in northern ireland the hon gentleman make really important point what we do today be not just set out money for next year we have set out money for day to day spending for the next three year and for capital spending for the next five year wherever people be in the uk it be vital that local council the devolve administrations and community group can plan for the future with confidence that be what we have do with this spending review and urge the devolved administration to do similar and make multi year settlement in order to give certainty for the future despite be the lowest fund unitary authority in the country we be do everything possible to drive down inequality in the city of york but the differential have stay at year today announcement of investment in health investment in social housing and investment in education will make real difference for my constituent however worry about the inequality for disabled people in our country have look through the statement will the chancellor give assurance that if disabled people be unable to work they will not be leave behind and that we will ensure that we have the social security they need so that they too can gain from today statement part of the investment in the north of england be for the trans pennine route upgrade which my hon friend and both welcome the investment in health and education be important but so too be support disabled people which be why billion have be set aside in the spending review to help get people back to work many disabled people be desperate to work if the right support be available of course the social security system and the welfare state must always be there for people who can not work and under this labour government they will be hear very little about somerset which be face huge pressure on gp practice affordable home send provision reliable bus service and access to affordable energy can the chancellor promise my constituent that yeovil will not be overlook and do she believe that the decision announce today leave somerset council and government departments with enough to properly invest in community in yeovil let put that right the people of somerset will benefit from uplift in nhs spending the people of somerset will benefit from free school meal for their child if they be on universal credit and the people of somerset will benefit from strong defence and strong border through the investment that we be make this be spending review for the whole country include people in yeovil in somerset the chancellor who visit birmingham last week know that the west midland region have the talent and idea to thrive fair settlement in today spending review be not just support it be smart investment in britain future over people be on the housing register in birmingham so thank she for double investment in the affordable home programme also thank she for the announcement on the midland rail hub investment which have be campaign for do she agree that that will be transformational in deliver decade of renewal and growth that work for everyone thank my hon friend for that question we will build more housing which be what the investment in affordable home grant will achieve and that go alongside transport investment significant transport investment in the west midland and birmingham be very pleased that my hon friend join in birmingham last week when we be able to celebrate the investment to extend the metro out to east birmingham and then to solihull thank the chancellor for her statement but fear that she may have misunderstood the question that my hon friend the member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer ask about the river thames scheme he ask whether the scheme be include in the billion tdel total departmental expenditure limit over three year reference in paragraph of the review the chancellor reply that my hon friend want to put up expenditure and will not say where it be come from but both he and be ask this be the environment agency half of the river thames scheme surrey county council pay the other half fund from the billion tdel that she have announce today the allocation have be make to government departments and the treasury be not go to micromanage every scheme so it will be up to departments to allocate the money in the way they choose be sure that the transport secretary will come to the house and set out those plan the spending review say that there will be report from the office for value for money on temporary accommodation and the terrible waste of money go into poorly procure temporary accommodation some child live in temporary accommodation in london do the chancellor agree that the billion for new genuinely affordable home combine with that review of the cost of temporary accommodation be really positive for all child live in london who sadly do not have permanent home into the future and do she agree that this will make transformational change in london my hon friend have speak to powerfully on many occasion about how much westminster city council have to spend on temporary accommodation which be why the investment in affordable home grant be so important and not just for london but for the whole country but there be specific issue as say in answer to my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi there be particular challenge in london because of the extraordinarily high house price and rent this investment in affordable and social housing can have big impact in london combine with the additional money for free school meal the roll out of breakfast club and the increase in the national living wage this be spending review to benefit people across the whole country include in westminster and london fellow eastbournian mark tonra and be gravely ill together in the same ward at eastbourne district general hospital last year harrowingly because of the outdated and outgrown hospital building at the dgh mark watch from his bay as patient opposite he die and other patient watch mark deteriorate with only flimsy curtain to protect his dignity before he himself die the delay to our new hospital will mean that many more eastbournians will face this indignity until it be fully rebuild come short of heed my town call to unlock that investment soon will the chancellor at least confirm to local family such as mark and to my nhs trust that her nhs capital expenditure will specifically be able to fund the unmet cost of our maintenance backlog in eastbourne to help more patient get the care and dignity they deserve thank the hon gentleman for speak powerfully about his experience and the experience of his constituent after the year and the broken promise of the conservative party our hospital be not in good enough condition that be why we have set out the new hospital building programme but it be also why we have put aside money in the spending review for improvement to hospital condition in the meantime will make sure that the relevant health minister meet he to talk through what that mean for people in eastbourne today announcement be great day for blackpool which be mention more than any other place in the country the chancellor will know the issue we face from when she join in blackpool last year and see for herself the deprivation and the damage that year of the tories do to our town will she confirm that this be just the start and the beginning of new investment for deprive area such as blackpool across the country now that we have labour government and labour chancellor in charge thank my hon friend for that question and he always passionately argue the case for blackpool yes there be deprivation in blackpool but there be also huge opportunity which be why we be back blackpool with the investment we be put in through the spending review why do the chancellor think it appropriate to pledge million on preferential basis to sporting organisation that have political objective as its first and defining attribute and that have name some of its sport ground and trophy after ira terrorist who bring such death and destruction to northern ireland while other organisation be require to make do with what they be allocate in do the chancellor not see and agree that million would make far well contribution to meet the housing need particularly for social housing and the sewerage infrastructure need that in my constituency have bring much of the building of new housing to halt what be the priority when matter like that be ignore alongside the investment at casement park we have also make record investment with record settlement for the northern ireland executive in the announcement we have set out today in addition there be substantial investment in the defence sector include in northern ireland so there be plenty of money go into northern ireland and it now need to be spend wisely commend the chancellor on her statement and pay tribute to she and to my right hon friend the welsh secretary and all my welsh labour colleague for their advocacy in stand up for wales at this spending review particularly welcome the investment in coal tip which will be really important in constituency across wales and in rail with million to turn the tide on year of under investment by the conservatives of whom four be leave on the opposition benches as she be here can take this opportunity to ask she whether give the substantial rail investment that have be announce she will use her good office to support campaign in my constituency for ely mill station to be build now all the stakeholder have the money they need they can get on with it can they not well we do announce two new railway station in wales today with that million in the year infrastructure strategy which we publish next week we will be set out more detail of investment right across the uk be pleased that my hon friend welcome the million for the coal tip work which know be so important and which so many welsh labour mp have lobby about over the last few month be pleased that we can deliver for their community in wales declare an interest as sit councillor local government will be pleased to see an increase in spending and to have clarity but alongside social care we have no clarity on another area that will sink council the statutory override on special educational need that be promise time and again and we be hang our hat on have it today will the chancellor tell we what be happen and can we give security to council on special educational need the hon lady make really important point every single mp in this house will have hear harrowing story of parent desperate to get support for their kid with special educational need the secretary of state for education will be bring forward white paper to make the reform that be desperately need we will make sure that we do that in partnership with the parent and child who be most affected the chancellor of the exchequer may remember that the last conservative prime minister boast about move funding from teesside to royal tunbridge wells be pleased to see that her statement plug place such as stockton north back into our economy thank the chancellor for agree to make stockton central one of the trailblazer area invest in our local facility and tackle fly tipping and graffiti do she agree that the statement show that our labour government be provide job for work people provide home for work people and provide opportunity for our young people be pleased that stockton will be benefit from some of those investment because pride in place be so important for all our community some of the most deprived part of the country have miss out on funding for too long which be why we be pleased to be able to rectify that and ensure for example through the green book reform that money go to where it be most need first of all welcome the fact that at least in real term the northern ireland budget have be maintain over the spending period although would point out to the chancellor that real increase will not enable the northern ireland executive to match the real increase in spending on health and policing which will be take place in the rest of the united kingdom may emphasise again the preference that she have give in this budget to money for gaelic athletic association ground in blunder into this issue she have give the executive massive financial headache she require million to be match by fund elsewhere the executive will be require to find about million to make up the deficit raise expectation and believe create tension within the executive as result think it be wrong for she to try to interfere in the minutia of spending of the executive in that way as general point maybe in the autumn many people who welcome the headline today will be regret the tax increase they will face to pay for the announcement today the announcement today be all within the envelope that already set out through the tax increase and the change to the fiscal rule in autumn and then the decision in the spring statement all we have do today be allocate the envelope that we already set out as say at the time public service would now need to live within the mean that we have set at that budget this statement do not spend single penny more or single penny less than the money that be already allocate on the specific issue the right hon gentleman raise be very happy to pass on what he say to the northern ireland secretary and to ensure that there be meeting between the relevant minister and the relevant members of parliament wholeheartedly welcome this statement it be true labour package that back britain and reverse year of declinism under party on the opposition benches who seem to have give up on britain particularly welcome the result of the green book review which will get investment into the place that need it most in that regard do the chancellor agree with that while big project and city scheme will get the headline it be vital that the full benefit of renewal be feel in small town like those that make up my constituency of rossendale and darwen and that these previously leave behind place must be at the forefront of our thinking as we develop local transport and infrastructure delivery plan my hon friend be one of many mp who have speak to about the need to reform the green book thank he for feed in his concern about the way in which the treasury have previously look at request for investment be pleased for the people of rossendale and darwen that we can start make difference to the community that be forget about for year under the conservatives be also very pleased to be in his constituency at the end of last year to open the banking hub on local high street welcome the government decision to widen access to free school meal long stand liberal democrat policy but castlewood primary school in my constituency tell that it be currently lose for every single meal it provide will the chancellor undertake to fully fund school meal or else be she ask school to choose between teaching and eat be really pleased that what we have set out today will lift child out of poverty by provide free school meal to an additional child real term funding for school be increase and real term funding per pupil be increase to ensure that school be able to provide the free school meal and the teaching that our child need thank the chancellor for announcement of the extra funding for crumble school as we know school across the country be leave to fail under the year of the previous government how can establishment such as forest high school in my constituency which be literally crumble day by day and at serious risk of closure access the vital fund so we can provide the service require by student in the forest of dean thank my hon friend for raise those concern about school in the forest of dean and that school in particular the state that school be in after year of conservative government be just not good enough after what they do in the and do not think that even conservative government would leave school in this state many mp will be able to talk about example similar to my hon friend from their constituency will ensure that the department for education and the education secretary hear about the specific case that he raise because we want to improve the condition that our young child be teach in thank the chancellor for her statement as well as free people up by tackle the social care crisis the real way to get the growth we all want be target for publicly fund social home albeit welcome the funding that have be find for housing and fund for the infrastructure that community want which will unlock ten of thousand of home the wellington and cullompton station project be something raise with the chancellor last summer she say at the dispatch box that it would be go ahead because it have start that project will bring million of growth to the cardiff bristol exeter corridor and generate hundred of new job be my constituent right genuine question to the chancellor to be dismay that there be no mention of any south west project in the statement today last week we set out additional money for the mayor of the west of england and today we have announce fourfold increase in local transport funding which will be available for community across the country the hon member say that he want to grow the economy it be disappointing that the liberal democrats vote against the planning and infrastructure bill yesterday which will do exactly that strongly congratulate the chancellor on the impact she have already have by reform the way the treasury work in particular to unlock the capital investment that we need for the future of our economy also commend she for her commitment to future generation through her funding for school and the extension of free school meal will she continue to work with the treasury to change the way it appraise the benefit of human capital investment to ensure there be sufficient funding particularly for early intervention in special educational need and disability in local authority like mine in reading and wokingham thank my hon friend for welcome the reform we have introduce at the treasury the reform to the fiscal rule to unlock money for investment the reform of financial transaction to enable more money to be spend through public finance institution and particularly the reform of the green book she be absolutely right to mention the importance of human capital which be why we have announce in the spending review significant investment in skill and in the early year to ensure that child be ready for school as the mp for woking represent the most bankrupt and indebted local authority in the country be very disappointed therefore that it appear that the chancellor do not mention council or local government once in her statement be more disappointed have listen to the detail of the statement that the government be invest only an extra in local government next year and the year after what do the chancellor say to council across the country and to my constituent in woking to justify that lack of investment this labour government be give real term increase in spending to local authority every year compare that with the conservative liberal democrat administration from to that cut real spending by every year be much happy to stand on my record as chancellor than would be to stand on what the liberal democrats do when they have chance at be in government thank the chancellor for listen to the priority of people in my constituency and across the country and invest in our school it be great to see free breakfast club in action at baildon glen and beckfoot priestthorpe school recently and be delighted to hear today that the labour government will be put in some billion to fix our crumble school have recently visit eldwick primary school where pupil be be teach in temporary building with half the school out of action due to reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete can the chancellor reassure the pupil at eldwick that they will finally be able to get back to their classroom thank my hon friend for the passion with which she speak about school which be something very much share that be why we be roll out breakfast club at primary school and introduce free school meal for all child whose carer be on universal credit it be why we be put in real term increase for school funding and per pupil funding and it be why we be address the terrible situation of child be teach in temporary classroom and crumble school will ensure that the department for education hear about the experience in shipley to hopefully ensure that that school be on the list woman come to my surgery in ealing southall last friday and show photo of the one bedroom she share with her four

billion as the system be fix the investment we be put into derby and nottinghamshire be significant with small modular reactor investment in defence and investment in fusion create good job and pay decent wage right across the east midland do not think that taxpayer money should be use to pay for asylum hotel which be why we be reduce the cost of asylum accommodation by around billion during the course of this parliament and end the use of asylum hotel it be source of pride to see labour chancellor announce such transformative programme for social housing my hope be that the boost to the affordable home programme can be use to unlock stall project like those in welwyn garden city in my constituency where the metropolitan thames valley development adjacent to the station need to get motor thank the chancellor for her investment today do she agree that our message to council and housing association be we back you now it be time for you to build the change we have make to the

unintentionally mislead the house when raise concern about the reclassification of the east west oxford to cambridge rail line as an england and wales project thereby deny wales its full share of consequential funding she claim that the previous classification of england only be merely conservative publishing error and insist that all heavy rail project would now be classify in such way so as to deny funding to wales to my surprise however the statement of funding policy still list the oxford to cambridge line as england only that contradict the secretary of state assertion and raise question about the accuracy of her comment in the house what step should take when have be accuse of mislead the house yet treasury document suggest that it be the secretary of state who have do so thank the right hon member for give notice of her intention to raise this point of order the chair be not responsible for the content of members speech however those on the treasury bench will have hear her point of order and be sure that the secretary of state will seek to correct the record if necessary on point of order madam deputy speaker the whole house will be appal as be by the grotesque and wanton violence that have afflict ballymena in my constituency and appal by the sexual assault of year old girl there can be no excuse for the result violence however the government must be aware of the underlie tension produce by uncontrolled and often undocumented immigration in that regard would it be in order to ask that the government make statement to the house on what they will do to constrain the flow of migrant who legitimately travel under freedom of movement from one eu country to another in this case into the republic of ireland and then pass unchecked from the republic of ireland into northern ireland that have be contributor particularly in respect of romas it would seem to the concentration and the result problem none of that excuse violence but it be matter of concern to many how can obtain statement from the government on how they intend to address that gap in our ability to control who come and go from our own country thank the hon and learn gentleman for his point of order have have no notice that the government intend to make statement however those on the government benches will have hear his comment which be now on the record he will also have an opportunity tomorrow during business question to raise the matter again bill presented animal shelters licensing bill presentation and first reading standing order no mr richard holden support by

british standard en the government say that they want to raise standard and focus on delivery so have get perfect bill for they the letter boxes positioning bill last christmas visit the royal mail delivery office in huyton in my constituency watch our postie work flat out and it really hit home how hard they work whatever the weather and whatever the condition ask what could do to help they say sort out those low level letter box they be worried that one of these day one of they could get life change injury just from do their job for example lancaster postie anthony quinn lose the top of his finger after dog lunge through letter box and bite he he be just do his job deliver the post south london postie andrew berge be attack through letter box by dog that lock on to his hand and would not let go he suffer serious damage to his ring finger and he be just do his job deliver the post and wakefield postie elaine white lose the top of her finger in similar attack the damage be so bad that doctor could not reattach it that be permanent life altering but she be just do her job deliver the post during my visit to the delivery office postie show scar and injury from dog attack through letter box member across the house will have hear countless story and first hand experience from our campaigner about get dog bite while deliver leaflet to low level letter box around of our postie have have their finger partly or fully bite off through letter box in the past five year it be clear to that letter box have reach new low and it be time we in this house raise they when letterbox be down by someone ankle any dog can bite draw blood or sever finger or two and it be not just about dog attack low level letter box force our postie to stoop repeatedly day in day out we have all be there on our leaflet delivery and as we walk down the path and see low level letter box the heart sink indeed the only thing low than the letter box be the mood of anyone who have to use one our postie have to do that every single day dozen of time and many of they get serious back problem and suffer back pain for year as result of their job royal mail record more than back relate injury in just one year some of those postie be with we in the gallery today thank they for join we and for all that they do their union the communication workers union have campaign for this change since why have it not happen yet recent survey of cwu rep find that report issue with low level letter box in new building and say that follow the standard propose in this bill letter box be cm from the ground would make real difference this be not just about protect worker though that be reason enough it be also about the cost of inaction in back pain alone lead to lose working day at royal mail cost it million and dog attack lead to nhs treatment police investigation and court case thank the member who have co sponsor the bill it be change that be support by postie up and down the country and by royal mail also believe it be support across this house because in the last parliament the former conservative member for chelmsford vicky ford bring forward similar bill which have widespread support and pay tribute to she and to the work she do on the issue also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for corby and east northamptonshire lee barron who be sit next to he be former postie and cwu regional secretary know that this issue can unite we all because when ask question on it some month ago in this chamber there be cry of hear hear from across the house hon member hear hear that be rare this should be simple fix the current british standard be that letter box height should be at least cm off the ground right now that be advisory this bill would make it mandatory this be not about ask people to change their exist door or letter box this bill be just about low level letter box in new building both residential and commercial this labour government will build million new home during this parliament and welcome the chancellor announcement today at the spending review of billion to help build new social and affordable housing however let we ensure that those home be build right so that postie do not go to work in fear of injury and let we build they without burden our public service with the cost of those injury as labour government we take our duty to look after work people seriously the bill will do just that load of other country such as ireland portugal and belgium have already ban low level letter box why be we behind they let we catch up with our neighbour on this let we raise the bar or height literally on letter box it will save pain prevent injury and cut cost it be the right thing to do for the people who deliver our post be part of our community and look after we day in day out and we will never forget the role they play during the covid pandemic our consideration for our postie health and safety at work should be first class therefore ask the house to give the bill its stamp of approval and get it sign seal and deliver as frequent leafleteer in sussex weald be particularly invest in this piece of legislation question put and agree to order that anneliese midgley lee barron charlie dewhirst colum eastwood emma foody louise haigh sally jameson joe morris sarah owen laurence turner chris webb and michael wheeler present the bill anneliese midgley accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday july and to be print bill sustainable aviation fuel bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time on the day when the chancellor have set out this government determination to deliver decade of national renewal be proud to stand before this house to make good on our promise to deliver sustainable aviation sector if we be once again to be an outward confident trading nation that be connect to the world and lead the way on innovation we must run as fast as we can towards greener clean future for fly the bill before we today will enable we to do precisely that we do not have time to waste do the secretary of state agree that this bill have missing half which could cut aviation emission by demand management and that at the very least if there be to be public money spend set up this system it should be raise from the most frequent flyer and private jet think the hon lady and fundamentally differ on the issue of demand management because demand for air travel be only go one way and it be therefore our moral responsibility if we be go to have more people in the sky to reduce the carbon emission associate with that as say we have no time to waste that be why when it come to aviation this government have roll up their sleeve and get on with the job put an end to the dither and delay of the past in less than year we have approve the expansion of luton airport and invite plan for new runway at heathrow and will be make final decision on gatwick expansion as soon as possible we have invest in the future of aviation not just with the help we have give to reopen doncaster sheffield airport or the work we be do to strengthen connectivity around liverpool john lennon but also by put billion towards aerospace technology we have introduce the sustainable aviation fuel mandate and provide million to the advanced fuel fund help the industry prepare for sustainable future just last week we kick start the large redesign of uk airspace since the pave the way for clean flight few delay and more direct route this be what govern for growth look like really welcome the bill and the creation of mechanism to increase the supply of sustainable aviation fuel can add that as we look towards airspace modernisation we will have not only clean and quick but quieter flight my hon friend be completely right to highlight the benefit of crack on and deliver airspace modernisation it could mean not only more direct flight and therefore less use of carbon but noise benefit for community close to airport we be determined to make rapid progress on this issue because we have an iron clothe belief that our success as an island nation rest on our international connectivity the flow of trade export british expertise and the movement of people for business and leisure all depend on aviation continue to grow and thrive we could put our head in the sand and pretend that people do not want to fly that the sector do not support hundred of thousand of job that people do not look forward to foreign holiday or family reunion and that air freight be not significant part of our trade by value but we would be on the wrong side of both reality and public aspiration the truth be that demand for flight be only go in one direction accord to the civil aviation authority passenger level be high in than in the previous year if we do not respond and if we do not set aviation up for long term success we do not just make ourselves poor today we kiss goodbye to the growth and opportunity this country need in the decade to come want future where more passenger can take to the sky not few but like the rest of our economy that must mean emit less carbon not more this bill will help secure that future it build on the fantastic work across government and industry lead by my hon friend the aviation minister which see the saf mandate come into effect early this year as we run towards future of green flight we know that sustainable aviation fuel be one of the big lever we can pull it emit less greenhouse gas on average than fossil fuel it can be use in exist infrastructure and aircraft engine and it be now back by mandate that be rightly ambitious saf in the fuel mix by and by want as much as possible to be make in the uk the mandate which we welcome call for only sustainable jet fuel usage by while the chancellor have say that she want third runway in use at heathrow by that would mean more aviation relate health hazard to my constituent do the minister agree that we should not pursue heathrow expansion until we can turbocharge the saf mandate and bring non sustainable fuel usage down far the government have be clear that we will permit airport expansion only when it be consistent with our legally bind climate change target saf be one way in which we can clean up aviation but the work we be do on the development of new aircraft technology alongside the work we be do on airspace modernisation be all connect to how we bring those emission down point out to the hon lady that the expansion of heathrow have already be model in relation to the sixth carbon budget we have be clear that the mandate alone be not enough create the demand for saf but not the supply do not get we where we want to be we have hear the industry concern around risk and uncertainty for investment and that be why we be act today the bill create revenue certainty mechanism that will boost saf production by give investor confidence to choose the uk declare an interest as pilot in this context speak to one of the would be producer think it be call zero and its primary concern with respect to the strike price mechanism that the right hon lady talk about be how that will be set and what input producer will have will she address that when she talk through the mechanism there be more detailed design work to do on all that and we will work alongside industry to ensure that we have workable proposition the mechanism boost saf production and give investor confidence in the uk by address one of the big barrier to investment the lack of clear predictable market price for saf that start with guarantee strike price agree between government own counterparty and the saf producer if saf be sell for under that price the counterparty will pay the difference to the producer if saf be sell for above that price the producer will pay the difference to the counterparty the revenue certainty mechanism will be fund by industry specifically through levy on aviation fuel supplier that make sense for two reason first it be the industry that will benefit from more and cheap saf production so it be only right that industry and not the taxpayer should fund it secondly place the levy higher up the supply chain spread cost across the sector and be the least burdensome option it be important to note that the revenue certainty mechanism will not be indefinite it will be target and time limited help to get first of kind uk project off the ground the bill sunset clause mean that we can offer contract only for year unless it be extend via the affirmative procedure we will have firm grip on cost throughout we will decide the number and duration of contract limit support to predetermine volume of saf and negotiate acceptable strike price there be no obligation on the government to enter into define number of contract or to agree contract at any cost know that some hon member may be concern about the impact on passenger so let reassure they none of this will limit people ability to fly we expect minimal change to fare with an average ticket increase or decrease by up to year be pleased to say that this be product of many month of consultation with the industry airline be call for it airport be call for it saf producer be call for it environmental organisation be call for it and the government be therefore get on with deliver it be sure that we wish the government well in what they be try to do gather that the international air transport association highlight only last week that at the moment sustainable aviation fuel cost approximately five time as much as conventional jet fuel will she explain how the measure in the bill will bridge that gap to make it economical supply be constrain at the moment the uk have one commercial production facility in immingham we need to build investor confidence to commercialise some of the sustainable aviation fuel demonstration project around the country more supply and low price be good for the aviation sector and ultimately good for those who wish to fly think it be worth take moment to reiterate what be at stake when uk production of low carbon fuel be up and run it could support up to green job contribute billion year to our economy and deliver clean and secure energy what be more fulfil the saf mandate could save up to megatonne of carbon dioxide equivalent year by seize those opportunity will ensure that we deliver on our bold plan for change and that the uk and our world class aviation sector be lead the way in the race towards sustainable flight this country can not be open for business open to investment and open to growth yet have closed mind when it come to international connectivity the bill be clear signal that we will not accept false trade off that pit aviation growth against our commitment to net zero we can and must do both we have the opportunity of lifetime and believe moral mission to future proof aviation when the sector succeed it be not only source of growth through trade business and tourism but source of joy aspiration and opportunity it be as vital today as it will be for future generation their need to fly explore the world and do business require we to act now that be what the bill do and commend it to the house call the shadow secretary of state let begin by set out an unambiguous truth aviation be vital to the british economy it be cornerstone of our national infrastructure our competitiveness and our connectivity when it come to the impact of aviation on our economy the figure speak for themselves aviation contribute billion to uk gdp support over job across the country that include people work directly in aviation from air traffic controller to aerospace job in the supply chain and another support through consumer spending aviation also deliver nearly billion in tax revenue and aerospace manufacturing add furth billion directly to gdp plus over billion more when include its supply chain some million passenger and million tonne of freight move through our airport each year the economic case be therefore unanswerable in short we must all support this thrive industry with clear benefit to the country the conservative party have always recognise the strategic importance of aviation but unlike the current government we understand the damage that can be do with poor policy choice regret to say that we have see plenty of that from the labour government over the past year alongside their national insurance job tax which be put pressure on business and threaten to leave work people year bad off labour decision to hike air passenger duty threaten the vitality of this thrive industry the office for budget responsibility confirm that rise plan by the chancellor of the exchequer will raise an extra million in taxis over five year push up the cost for business and passenger alike in speech that will have lot of common ground with the secretary of state speech regret to say that labour handling of its profess desire to expand aviation raise more question than answer the decision to approve second terminal at luton airport which we support will be judicially review the proposal for second runway at gatwick have be kick down the road for surprising reason to say the least and the suppose support for third runway at heathrow be no more credible the chancellor have promise that the latter proposal will be operational by with spade in the ground in this parliament but that ambition look very far fetched and there be substantial logistical and financial barrier to its construction so far the government have provide no solution on those point so we will watch development in the next few week with considerable interest it be against that backdrop that we come to the bill before we when we enter opposition we make it clear that we would not oppose the government just for the sake of it we make it clear that where the government choice would benefit the country or the economy we would welcome they that be why we will not seek to divide the house on this legislation on second reading this bill be logical follow on from the statutory instrument pass in september last year that establish the saf mandate the first stage of which come into effect in january have mandate that airline will be require to use specified percentage of this year rise to in and in it be logical to take step to ensure adequate level of locally produce fuel while the mandate require the consumption of saf it be new technology and its production carry high risk for investor encourage the development of the plant require to produce this fuel be the purpose of this bill and to very large degree it be continuation of the policy of the previous government in it be the last government who commit to an industry fund revenue certainty mechanism to support uk base saf production in early we publish the detail with plan for guarantee strike price model to give price certainty to saf producer hear the minister say you do do it he be completely correct because unfortunately there be something call general election that follow shortly after as the secretary of state have outline under this model producer will be top up when the market price fall below guarantee strike price when the market price rise above they will pay it back the system mirror the successful contract for difference model in offshore wind and the economic benefit could be considerable cost benefit analysis produce by the department for transport before the general election suggest that the saf industry could add more than billion to the economy and create more than job in the country but more fundamentally saf be product of what we know to work as the secretary of state say in her speech it can be blend with conventional jet use in exist aircraft and refuel at exist airport the capability exist the challenge be not scientific it be economic that be why the concept of revenue certainty mechanism be one of the six pillar in the previous government jet zero strategy and as the secretary of state outline the introduction of revenue certainty mechanism have wide support in the aviation industry let be clear while we will not oppose the legislation this evening we will carefully scrutinise it as it progress through the house in that spirit will put some question to the minister which hope he will address in his sum up the first be about passenger in the press release announce the bill the government say that the revenue certainty mechanism would keep ticket price change minimal keep fluctuation to year on average the secretary of state say the same in her speech perhaps in his speech the minister could outline what this figure be base on do the government stand by it be it commitment or rough estimate the second question be about what type of saf the government favour and how it will be produce while the saf mandate permit the production and use of hydroprocessed ester and fatty acid saf in the early year of the mandate and also contain small but increase requirement for power to liquid saf in later year the bulk of the saf to be develop and use under the term of the mandate be second generation saf which be to be make from municipal waste non edible crop and woody biomass the uk be small island with insufficient spare land to enjoy self sufficient food security or to grow new forest at scale do the minister think we will be self sufficient if not what proportion of the ingredient necessary for make second generation saf do the minister think we will need to import relatedly the hefa cap come into force incrementally from despite there currently be no domestic production of second generation saf in the uk and low level of second generation saf produce globally remove the opportunity to source mandate volume through import this risk make the cost of hit saf mandate target very high indeed because supplier will soon be force to buy out of their mandate obligation significant cost that will be pass on to the airline and ultimately to passenger without deliver any decarbonisation benefit at all will the government consider revise the timeline for phase out hefa saf to bring they more in line with the timescale for domestic second generation saf production in order to minimise the cost for passenger the next area of interest be plan the plant in which the government be seek to encourage investment will be large and as the minister no doubt know large development tend to attract lot of local opposition often lead to planning inquiry judicial review vast expense and year of delay before any construction work begin if this do not change the revenue certainty mechanism may not be sufficient to attract investor so what will the government do to minimise delay in the planning process turn now to timescale when will the first contract be award under the rcm will there be timetable for reach full mandate compliance as my right hon friend the member for goole and pocklington david davis who be no long in his place touch on the issue of the strike price be critical to the success of the proposal what criterion will be use to set the strike price will the methodology be publish and will there be regular review finally will the government commit to regular reporting to parliament on industry take up production capacity and cost trajectory to ensure that they remain accountable for the bill over time the importance of this bill be clear back uk production of sustainable aviation fuel be necessary if we be to meet our net zero goal without undermine the competitiveness of the aviation sector however let be clear as the bill move through the house we will continue to look closely at the detail and press for change where necessary where improvement can be make to ensure that the scheme deliver on its promise call the chair of the transport committee start by thank the secretary of state for transport for her speech also thank she and the aviation minister my hon friend the member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane for come to speak to the transport committee early this year about aviation and of course wide matter welcome the introduction of the bill and be pleased to hear the remark of the shadow secretary of state the hon member for orpington gareth bacon the bill will play an important role in our work to decarbonise our aviation sector some of domestic greenhouse gas emission come from domestic and international flight and it be estimate that this figure will increase to by and by we all know the huge challenge involve in decarbonise aviation and this bill be much need step towards address they be glad that the government be take action and know that many in the industry want to ensure that the bill be operational as soon as possible as be sure the transport secretary will appreciate have few question about the bill which be sure will also be raise at later stage of its progress however start by say that it be rare to find bill on which there be so much agreement every major airline have meet have mention its support for saf and there be widespread agreement that we need price certainty mechanism that be sign that the government have be pragmatic work with business and in the case of saf work to ensure that we have domestic capacity here in the uk be glad that the bill will start to move we away from our dependency on import fossil fuel particularly for aviation this house may forget that our reliance on foreign fossil fuel mean that in we have to spend more than billion bail out our energy market that reliance leave we reliant on the whim of autocratic regime across the world we need to move away from that costly model and in turn bring investment into our region growth to our economy and much need tax revenue to our treasury be glad that the uk government be work to make sure that we continue to lead on decarbonisation and to reduce our carbon emission in line with the paris agreement want to touch on the nature of the saf we will be use first and second generation saf be make from waste the first from used cooking oil predominantly and the second from waste such as household black bin bag waste where do the government see that waste come from in the future how do that tie in with our effort to reduce our residual waste particularly black bin bag waste and wide effort to reduce the non recyclable waste that we produce be large part of our household waste not already go to waste to energy plant provide electricity that we depend on there be lot of support for saf in america and as with ethanol it offer huge chance for large scale agricultural business to profit from the sale of their waste and their oil ethanol be often produce in the same plant as saf in seek to secure uk domestic production of saf what could the challenge of the us uk trade agreement mean for our biofuel industry and its ability to transition to produce saf have the department model the economic and environmental impact of provide resource for second generation saf what be the timescale to bring on third generation saf one issue that have be raise with be whether company look at produce saf will be able to enter negotiation with the government before the bill reach the statute book understand that that have be the case for the mechanism for renewable energy project where negotiation begin early to ensure that the investment be lock in we need to see change in aviation to meet our ambitious climate goal now that aviation and shipping be include in our carbon budget those change be even more important and hope that the government will also look beyond saf when think about decarbonise aviation saf be not and will not be the silver bullet solution to the sector responsibility to this country decarbonisation strategy my hon friend like represent west london constituency brentford and isleworth be very close to my constituency of ealing southall she will know that while our constituent support the work towards more sustainable air industry they also want to see work to reduce the noise we hear in west london from the airline industry do she agree that the airline industry must also look at new quieter plane and airspace modernisation for those community my hon friend and neighbour be absolutely right and know that the plane and engine manufacturer be continue to work as they have do for decade to be fair on quieter and less polluting aircraft sometimes there be tension between those two airspace modernisation will not make lot of difference to my constituency in term of land aircraft but overall airspace modernisation will play part in reduce emission and flight time for passenger as have say saf be not and will not be the silver bullet solution to the problem of aviation responsibility for decarbonisation the climate change committee warn parliament in that rely on saf alone be high risk for example heathrow airport be already the single great source of carbon emission in the uk and the current plan for expansion would add an extra to megatonne of carbon dioxide year if the government do expand heathrow other airport across the uk will have to make cut to ensure that aviation do not breach its carbon target furthermore continue increase in aviation emission will have to be offset against significant cut in emission in other sector should like to hear from the transport secretary what the government be do to address that particular challenge when the transport committee consider saf during the last parliament we find that it have significant potential and know that there be support throughout the house for we to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emission from aviation as chair of the committee also know how widespread support across the sector be for decarbonisation and that many private company be already way ahead in prepare for the future this country need to stay ahead of the game internationally and be glad that by introduce the bill the government be show their commitment invest in uk industry and show that the uk can be leader on sustainability thank the secretary of state for her speech and congratulate the aviation minister on the bill the challenge face the aviation sector as with our entire economy be decarbonisation reach net zero by be essential and give the scale of the scientific and technical challenge it be clear that decarbonise aviation will not be easy sustainable aviation fuel have an important role to play in this effort we consequently welcome the establishment of saf revenue certainty mechanism which have long be call for by many in the aviation industry and which as we have hear be vital to ensure that the saf mandate be both feasible and achievable for airline provide saf producer with guarantee level of revenue will be key to unlock investment in the sector which think answer some of the question pose by the shadow minister the hon member for orpington gareth bacon it will help to stimulate private capital at this early stage and will support the uk ambition to become global leader in saf development and production the growth of the industry also have the potential to generate job and economic activity across the country however while my party support the bill there remain important question regard in particular the scrutiny of the mechanism international alignment and the wide strategy for aviation decarbonisation the bill set out the broad principle for the revenue mechanism but leave much of the detail to secondary legislation and ministerial discretion that is to degree understandable the early stage of saf technology and the uncertainty in market development mean that flexibility be crucial and necessary but the government must ensure that parliament have an adequate opportunity to scrutinise the development of the mechanism and the saf sector more broadly give the importance of saf to achieve net zero in aviation it be vital that the house be update regularly on progress in the industry and on whether any adjustment to the mechanism be necessary that be especially important in the light of previous government promise to kick start the domestic saf industry promise that have yet to materialise in the conservatives promise to have five commercial saf plant up and run by but as so often they fail to deliver will therefore be push in committee for the bill to increase the level of ongoing scrutiny it be also crucial for the uk to work collaboratively with international partner on net zero aviation technology currently the criterion for both what qualify as saf and what level of different technology should be use differ between the uk and the eu with each jurisdiction prioritise different fuel type at different time give the inherently international nature of the aviation sector close regulatory alignment with the eu and other key partner be essential to foster growth in the industry and ensure that there be sufficient level of saf production internationally to support the transition the government must therefore work more closely with the eu and other to ensure that our framework dovetail finally while we welcome this bill it be important to acknowledge that saf alone will not be enough to decarbonise aviation as the chair of the transport committee make clear although saf can significantly reduce the carbon intensity of air travel flight use saf will not be carbon neutral so many of the necessary emission reduction to reach net zero will need to come from other area by the government own estimate saf could cut emission by million tonne of equivalent by that be not insignificant but give the project growth in passenger number it would represent only reduction in overall aviation emission compare with today while the lib dems support the bill we continue to urge the government to take more ambitious action to decarbonise the aviation industry with plan for airport expansion still on the table the government must clearly articulate how net zero aviation will be achieve by thank the secretary of state and the aviation minister for their engagement while bring forward this legislation this bill be vital not only to meet our national climate commitment but to ensure strong regional economic growth such as in my constituency of north somerset where bristol airport beacon in the uk transition to sustainable aviation be locate bristol airport have long demonstrate real leadership in this space in march it become bp first uk customer to receive supply of sustainable aviation fuel in march nearly year before the government mandate begin operate flight from bristol airport use blend of sustainable aviation fuel reduce the emission that these flight generate by an astounding in recognition of the airport leadership in this area in december this government make the very wise decision to appoint it to the jet zero taskforce where it will be able to share its year of experience and expertise with the group the leadership and vision show by institution such as bristol airport be not just laudable but necessary if we be to reach net zero by aviation have be domestic economic success story in recent decade it now contribute billion to the uk economy annually include billion in export and support over half million job across the country with over of the member of this house have or more constituent who work in aerospace aviation or the wide supply chain will not be alone in recognise how vital it be for the economic future of our country to ensure that this industry remain success however the ugly truth be that the sector account for around of the uk total emission and if we be to decarbonise the aviation industry while ensure that fly remain affordable and accessible it be to innovation such as sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen in aviation that we must turn as the sustainable aviation fuel mandate begin to ramp up demand in the year to come domestic production will sadly continue to lag behind so this bill revenue certainty mechanism be essential learn from the success that contract for difference have lead to for renewable the revenue certainty mechanism will unlock the uk production by provide certainty for investor and could see up to skilled and well pay job create by my constituent in north somerset will welcome the news that the government continue to balance the need to support regional economic growth with meet our net zero commitment and look forward to see the local job and clean sky that this bill will deliver in the year to come the uk have real opportunity to lead the world in the production of sustainable aviation fuel and this bill aim to provide the investment certainty need to scale up domestic saf production and achieve just that my constituency be locate stone throw from london luton airport it be rapidly expand regional airport and that expansion will bring with it huge economic benefit include job for thousand of my constituent and well connection for business and leisure indeed airport expansion will help to bring million of people to the universal uk theme park which have to mention every time stand up and play key role in drive local economic growth but just as it be important to support the growth of airport such as luton it be important that expansion happen as sustainably as possible to ensure that we get as many of the benefit and as few of the harm as possible this be the subject of current environmental audit committee inquiry which be pleased to secure investigate how the government can deliver airport expansion while meet their legally bind climate target some such as the climate change committee say that it be not possible and the government need to square that circle with around of greenhouse gas derive from aviation in the uk we should not underestimate the challenge but it be clear to that sustainable aviation fuel be an important piece of the jigsaw in my constituency of mid bedfordshire cranfield university and local industry be already work at the cutting edge of develop new technology in this area have hear from they and other expert about the potential of british make sustainable aviation fuel have even learn about second generation saf not something that think would get into this time last year which turn the waste we all put in our black bin every week into the fuel that power we to adventure abroad that be remarkable thing and be glad to have learn about it since come into the house if we get sustainable aviation fuel right we can create and support thousand of highly skilled job in place such as cranfield do more to stimulate the development of sustainable aviation fuel be an obvious route to economic growth so will the minister reflect on our global market position explain how the mechanism compare with other approach and give an assurance that the measure in the bill will be enough to avoid the uk aviation industry need to import saf from abroad it would be huge miss opportunity to later find that this mechanism and related policy have not be ambitious enough leave foreign country to benefit from domestic mandate one thing that strike immediately as worthy of more thought the minister may wish to comment be black bin waste take waste that be head to landfill and instead use it to power we into the sky would seem to be simple way forward although whether there be enough of it be another matter declare my interest as central bedfordshire councillor but will the minister consider the merit of include in this bill or elsewhere requirement for the secretary of state to provide local authority with guidance on how they can take advantage of this opportunity to help in the national effort to scale up production unless it be financially prohibitive for they to do so would it not be sensible and pragmatic to let they use our household waste in this way rather than let it head to landfill or local incinerator finally have few question for the minister on the cost of aviation travel as we all know time be tight for many of our constituent uk air passenger duty be the world high tax levy on airline passenger and follow the autumn budget the obr forecast that it will increase year on average to whopping billion in on top of that it be estimate that the impact of the bill through the levy and administration cost will raise the cost of ticket to travel know minister say that it be modest increase but that be why some may prefer the government to use an alternative funding mechanism such as the industry contribution to the uk emission trading scheme be not say that the government should take that approach but it would be worthwhile for they to explain why they have take the approach they have reflect on the fact that the cost of the bill come on top of the increase to air passenger duty in the autumn budget will the minister provide an assurance that the bill will not clobber our hard work constituent with yet high price when they jet off on their family holiday refer the house to my business interest in the register of members financial interests as proud advocate of uk aviation be pleased to speak in support of the sustainable aviation fuel bill and add my thank to the aviation minister for his determination in support of uk aviation and to the secretary of state for her leadership by back industry with revenue certainty mechanism the bill will turbocharge the production of uk saf reduce reliance on import and generate job up and down the country as one of the most carbon intensive and hard to decarbonise form of transport aviation be vital to get right alternative and sustainable aviation fuel will help we to safeguard the future of our planet because without decarbonised aviation sector there will be no net zero decarbonising will ensure that future generation can enjoy the opportunity that air travel bring without compromise the health of our planet it will ensure that our regional economy continue to benefit from the growth that the aviation sector can offer such as the whopping job that east midlands airport support in derby we be already make bold stride towards our net zero future be proud that rolls royce move quickly to confirm the compatibility of its long haul aircraft engine in both the wide body and business jet sector with saf usage the derby factory will continue to play significant role in shape the future of aviation decarbonisation for year to come we recognise that decarbonisation will not be without its challenge sustainable aviation fuel offer practical and innovative solution to those challenge with saf make from waste emit staggering less carbon than burn conventional jet fuel this be what the saf bill recognise it be bold and necessary step forwards to secure sustainable net zero future for aviation be proud to support it as chair of the all party parliamentary group for the future of aviation travel and aerospace very much welcome this step to push the aviation industry into sustainable future encourage member to join the appg and come along to our meeting if they want to find out more about sustainability and the future of aviation work in the aviation industry for year before be elect to this place and study aeronautical engineering for four year before that so it would have be remiss of not to come to the chamber today to share with hon member my expertise on the subject but will try not bore they welcome the support for future technology and the investment previously announce by the government we have massive and historical expertise in aviation here in great britain and northern ireland and we really must grasp the opportunity to develop those skill and that technology far it be an incredible opportunity for uk plc and we need to grasp it want to pick up on comment by the secretary of state in her opening speech about airspace modernisation because it be relevant to the discussion we must grasp the opportunity of airspace modernisation which have the potential as she mention to deliver short more direct and more efficient flight route but as mp we must engage with the process we must understand and learn about how that be happen around we it be inevitable but we must get the good for our community we must understand and engage with that process as it go along it be an incredible opportunity over the past few month the appg have be hear about the technology that we have today of particular interest be zeroavia which be already fly hydrogen electric zero emission aircraft in the uk it have hydrogen fuel cell with electrical propulsion which offer completely zero emission flight as my hon friend the member for wimbledon mr kohler mention this be only stepping stone to the truly zero emission flight that we really need to capture if hon member will forgive for bore they slightly the breguet range equation that learn about for my degree be the reason why an airbus will take off from london at tonne and land in sydney at around tonne the burning of fuel throughout the journey mean that it be able to maintain the range and maintain the flight level that the burning of the fuel and the reduction in the weight require that be one reason why liquid fuel will almost always be require for very long haul flight no matter how far we progress with hydrogen and electrical power plant for short and medium haul flight that amplify the need not just for the current second generation saf production but for look at alternative fuel source such as algae derive saf other have correctly make the point about the reduction in residual waste which be the current fuel source for lot of biodiesel for the development of saf as those source decrease and the cost potentially increase we need to look at truly zero carbon source of saf will not bore hon member more in closing will just echo the word of my hon friend the member for wimbledon and of my party and encourage the minister to go far and fast to achieve truly zero carbon and low noise aviation technology so that we can continue to enjoy the incredible freedom and opportunity in both economic activity job skill and trade and the broaden horizon that aviation have offer we for more than century long may it continue order will now announce the result of today defer division on the draft contracts for difference miscellaneous amendments no regulations the ayes be and the noes be so the ayes have it the division list be publish at the end of today debate since enter this place almost year ago have be proud to be part of the campaign lead by my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher to reopen doncaster sheffield airport and unleash the economic potential of the surround land as hub for sustainable aviation our airport be source of pride for all of we in doncaster and south yorkshire we all eagerly anticipate the first flight for holidaymaker but also perhaps more importantly we be look forward to the high skill high wage job that the airport will bring and not just for people in doncaster and south yorkshire today but for young people for generation to come that be why my right hon friend the members for doncaster north ed miliband and for rawmarsh and conisbrough john healey my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher and along with mayor ros jones and mayor oliver coppard and indeed the whole of south yorkshire be delighted that this labour government back million of devolve funding into our airport thank the secretary of state for transport and the minister with responsibility for aviation for their support in our airport our area and our potential government who prioritise growth must ensure that it be place base and feel in every corner of the country thank my hon friend and neighbour for give way and for what she have say today do she agree that there be real potential for farmer to contribute by support feed stock from winter crop create circular environmental economy that help the local economy to grow far with new kind of job include for people who live in rural area absolutely agree the bill be not just about the small narrow element of sustainable aviation it be about what every industry across the country can do in the shared endeavour to make our aviation sustainable if this government growth agenda be to be success it must be feel in every corner of the country include doncaster and south yorkshire and be pleased that with our airport investment and the backing from the prime minister reiterate just today by the chancellor this government have prove that they will do just that as the secretary of state say low carbon fuel could support up to job and contribute billion to the economy by the sustainable aviation fuel bill be promising boost to our ambition in doncaster to create sustainable aviation hub link to our airport prove despite what some on the opposition benches may say that the green agenda and the sustainability agenda be firmly weave into and be in fact essential to the regeneration of area that have often be forget such as mine and to the industry of the future good job for young people and the security of the nation the bill revenue certainty mechanism will widen opportunity for innovator entrepreneur and producer of fuel propel our aviation industry to world class level and help we to become world leader in an emerge market that will benefit our economy our industry and our climate perhaps most importantly this critical infrastructure be sorely need in doncaster and indeed across the country to bring about the high skill high wage job for my constituent and for young people across south yorkshire know that our airport will champion the government aviation fuel ambition as will the snp welcome the bill which will support the expand use of sustainable aviation fuel we view that as an important action among the range of action that be need to meet our legal and most importantly moral obligation to reduce carbon and support global effort to tackle climate change my constituency have already play an important role in the use of saf with raf lossiemouth be the first air force base to use saf fuel blend for routine operation for both the poseidon submarine hunter and the typhoon squadron operate with saf mix the raf have also conduct demonstrator flight with saf fuel aircraft and refuel jet in the air with saf indeed group captain sarah brewin the station commander at raf lossiemouth have state the use of sustainable aviation fuel represent significant milestone in the raf journey towards help mitigate against climate change by integrate sustainable practice into our operation we be not only enhance our ability to protect the nation and deliver excellence on operation but also contribute to more sustainable future for generation to come welcome the fact that the raf have some ambitious target to reduce its aviation carbon emission inverness airport publicly own by highlands and islands airports ltd and responsible to the scottish government have offer saf to operator since vital piece of work towards the scottish government deliberately ambitious goal of create the world first net zero aviation region by offshore supply flight be one of the most promising part of our aviation sector for saf potential with scotland have the lion share of these flight from aberdeen airport it be vital that we see investment in saf production in scotland aberdeen airport operate by ags airports have supply saf since help offshore industry to reduce their emission in one of the first fully saf helicopter flight in the uk take off from aberdeen airport bp be work with bristow helicopters to ensure that flight to bp platform have use saf blend for more than two and half year scotland have an immense saf production potential the bill alone be insufficient to see we reach that potential but it be an important part of that scotland saf progress have be hold back by the inaction of successive uk government on fund the scottish carbon capture usage and storage cluster the ccus cluster be in turn integral to the investment in saf production at grangemouth industry body sustainable aviation find that uk saf industry could deliver billion annually to the uk economy and create more than job it be vital that with long overdue funding finally confirm today something that the snp have campaign on for over decade the full detail be rapidly make clear and that pace be far inject into the process if that overdue cash be to be convert to construction and processing my snp colleague and transport secretary in the scottish government have put in place an expert work group on sustainable aviation fuel to exploit the potential for the scottish economy have cover our broad welcome for the bill but there be one area that the government must address which be ensure that feedstock be come from sustainable source we welcome the secretary of state comment on further design work in the process and we will see that come through in the passage of the bill however the government must set out how they plan to manage the sourcing of sustainable aviation fuel feedstock so that the waste hierarchy be adhere to and that exist business be not damage by the introduction of the revenue certainty mechanism the most obvious illustration of this be the potential use of high quality wood as one potential feedstock for saf production some member but suspect not all will be aware that current demand for wood will outstrip supply by it will be obvious to everyone that it take more than year to grow forest so there be real and well articulate concern from organisation such as the wood panel industry federation and the many sawmill operator throughout the uk the uk wood panel industry currently supply of the uk demand for wood panel product utilise of the annual roundwood harvest basket and of the annual waste wood basket fully of the uk economy utilise wood panel product and again it will not be lose on the government that in order to achieve million new home target something the snp welcome give our own substantial success in social and affordable housing build in scotland protect and grow wood supply will be absolutely vital the eligibility criterion for the saf mandate stipulate that feedstock material must be waste that can not be prevent reuse or recycle in accordance with the waste hierarchy while the mandate acknowledge the waste hierarchy which in principle would prioritise the use of waste wood for recycle before energy recovery it be not clear how it will be monitor and enforce leave supply of waste wood vulnerable to be use in saf against the eligibility criterion there be risk that the introduction of revenue certainty mechanism will incentivise producer wish to use this essential raw material for saf production there will be time during the passage of the bill for ministers to mitigate this risk and address this issue across the departments involve of which there be several particularly hope that the deputy prime minister responsibility for housing will help to focus ministerial and wide departmental mind on ensure that the final iteration of the bill support sustainable saf feedstock there be many good way to manufacture saf and there be some bad one let we get the mix right in this bill welcome this tremendous legislation which come not minute too soon after the previous government self admittedly sit on their hand the bill will enable the essential move to the production of british sustainable aviation fuel and put on the record my thank to the ministerial team and official for bring the bill forward and for their answer to my extensive write question unless it be the will of the house to cry for the end of aviation as practice it be imperative that we back the sustainable use of biofuel municipal waste cover crop ethanol and even carbon dioxide straight out of the atmosphere for aviation fuel the mandate provide modest progression for the aviation industry towards incorporate this fuel into its mix we have genuinely world lead research and development on teesside such as through project speedbird and lighthouse green fuels the green shoot of industry there must be support by government to enable their outcome both airline and airport recognise the environmental and economic imperative of build domestic saf market they understand that rely on import to meet the mandate increase cost and introduce risk to our energy security aviation resilience and national competitiveness and there be the geopolitical risk of expose ourselves to cheap chinese market we shamefully see the previous government be willing to do that as expose by the hundred of job now on the line at alexander dennis in my constituency due to aggressive state subsidise chinese industrial practice capture an incrementally increase share of the british bus manufacturing market it be also in no small part thank to the snp government recently buy four time as many chinese bus as bus from scotland but digress there be credible investment interest from traditional jet fuel producer and aviation operator which have show their willingness to put capital behind uk saf project that investment be wait for the rcm to be put in place for private law contract with manufacturer to be agree and for the industry to have complete certainty in invest in what be nascent and uncertain technology the bill must pass through the house as quickly as possible one of the place that can not afford to wait for investment be grangemouth the closure of the grangemouth refinery have mark the end of over century of oil refining on falkirk doorstep and job in the wide supply chain be at risk daily due to the loss of the economic anchor that the refinery provide the community petroineo conversion of the refinery into an import terminal compound the concern within the community that we will be reliant on cheap chinese import instead of grow our own saf grangemouth have the infrastructure skill logistic and the will to be cornerstone of our domestic saf industry and strategy in scotland and across the united kingdom and it already have commitment from the government of million from the national wealth fund organisation such as scottish enterprise and the team around project willow be already assess investable proposal centre on saf in grangemouth however the date for commencement of operation suggest in the report be still far too remote from the practical reality of worker who need to feed their kid and pay their mortgage with strategic support and the wise and expedient deployment of the million dedicate by this uk labour government to grangemouth firmly believe that we can rapidly transition grangemouth from aviation fuel to saf serve as model of industrial renewal there be implication for fuel security in scotland for job in my constituency and the cost of heating and industrial fuel across the country we can not allow this to become another miss opportunity for grangemouth to have chance of succeed we need acceleration with that in mind would like the minister to answer the follow question consider that industry be raise concern that we may have to wait up to nine month between the commencement of this legislation in quarter of and the first private law contract be confirm what work can be do prior to the introduction of this legislation to bring the first of the contract into effect as soon as humanly possible how do the bill intersect with project willow proposal for saf at grangemouth do the minister understand the need to back and deliver that at pace would he like to touch on how the project willow report recommend delay the hefa cap do he consider the use of waste feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel to be dirty clean or the same as waste incineration what conversation have he have with colleague at the department for environment food and rural affairs regard the waste hierarchy implication in summary we need the rcm rapidly and we need to develop the industry at scale and affordably hope that we can genuinely back british saf safeguard fuel security protect skilled job and anchor the energy transition in community such as grangemouth teesside and all across the united kingdom rise to speak in this important debate as we address the challenge of modernise fuel source and reduce our dependency on fossil fuel declare my interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group for the wood panel industry the transition to net zero in aviation be not just climate imperative but an industrial opportunity commend the government for bring forward the bill which aim to provide long term certainty for investor in the uk grow sustainable aviation fuel sector however in our effort to decarbonise aviation we must be careful not inadvertently to harm other strategically important industry that also contribute to our economic growth and environmental goal the uk wood panel industry be one such sector it generate more than billion in gross value add and support more than job across the uk many in high skilled manufacturing role in wales the north of england and scotland include my home of ayrshire and beyond those be well pay productive and future face job the sector be one of the uk large industrial recycler of post consumer waste wood it take what would otherwise be discard and turn it into essential material for furniture interior design and crucially the home we be build yet there be genuine concern that the saf revenue certainty mechanism could distort market by incentivise the diversion of recyclable wood and forestry product to fuel production we have see that before with the renewable heat incentive where subsidy inflate virgin wood price and squeeze out establish manufacturer we can not afford to repeat that mistake be pleased to hear that minister have meet industry representative listen to their concern and respond positively would like to invite my hon friend the aviation minister to come and speak to the appg so that he can hear from the industry at first hand the saf mandate rightly reference the waste hierarchy prioritise reuse and recycling before energy recovery however the enforcement mechanism remain unclear if high quality waste wood be draw into saf production price will rise availability will fall and our domestic supply chain will suffer let be clear that support the ambition of saf also support the government ambition to build million new home but that will not be possible without affordable sustainable construction material include wood panel urge ministers to maintain the current safeguard in the saf mandate uphold the exclusion of virgin and recyclable wood from eligibility ensure robust enforcement of the waste hierarchy so that only truly non recyclable wood can be use and put in place transparency mechanism so that we can track what feedstock be be use if we get the balance right we can deliver clean sky and affordable home and we can decarbonise aviation without decimate domestic manufacturing let we make saf sustainable in every sense environmentally economically and industrially thank the minister for all his engagement on the subject be definitely not an expert on sustainable aviation fuel it be nice to be in debate where we can learn so much but will focus on what it could mean for my area of norfolk and the east of england as we have hear the bill have the power to support sustainable aviation industry that will reduce carbon emission protect highly skilled job and drive green growth norwich airport in my constituency have be user of sustainable aviation fuel since saxonair local flight operator report that it use nearly litre of sustainable aviation fuel for single aircraft alone in that usage show we what substantial reduction in carbon emission can be make compare with regular jet fuel but much more need to be do recently norwich airport suffolk and norfolk county council and saxonair launch aviation east vision to make east anglia an innovation hub for sustainable aviation sustainable aviation fuel be reference as one of the vital building block for that mission but that and what we be discuss today be part of much broad landscape of innovation and decarbonisation in aviation the east of england be already see amazing work to revolutionise the way we travel result in fast clean transport solution such as electric aircraft and drone taxi in fact as the minister say recently we could have fly taxi in the norfolk sky by the jetsons be come to norwich and the minister will be come too to go in an electric plane alongside this important bill welcome action that the government be take to decarbonise aviation through airspace modernisation low and zero emission aircraft and carbon pricing welcome the billion of funding for the aerospace technology institute and the work that the civil aviation authority be do in the regulatory environment for zero emission aircraft the potential in our region the east of england be huge include for our local economy and importantly our young people young people grow up in norfolk and norwich as do want lot of different opportunity but too often those opportunity be not there and especially not on their own doorstep know we can deliver many more job and apprenticeship include at the international aviation academy in norwich which count klm as one of its partner be also on mission to work with local stakeholder so that that academy be work at full capacity open up opportunity to local people both now and for future generation deliver the vision of aviation east and the measure in the bill feed clearly into the government growth mission by deliver highly skilled sustainable world lead engineering job however all fledgling innovation need protection and sustainable aviation fuel be no different if it be to grow into an industry that could transform air travel for the well welcome the sustainable aviation fuel mandate that come into force this year and require the blending of saf into the uk wide aviation fuel mix support that goal but recognise that it be achievable only when supplier be protect and support by ensure that price be guarantee regardless of market force recently meet member of the east anglian air ambulance and pay tribute to the amazing work they do base out of norwich airport they tell that they use mix of saf but that it be expensive and perhaps they could use bit more if the price come down if the government want to encourage innovation and drive growth in region such as the east of england provide backstop price be the signal that show investor we be serious about good green growth with the bill support sustainable aviation fuel producer regional innovation hub such as norwich airport will only benefit help to increase their contribution to the uk sustainable aviation industry reduce carbon emission tackle climate change and drive green growth fully back the bill my contribution come from slightly different angle compare with that of other hon member but from the outset let be clear welcome the government plan for sustainable aviation fuel and thank my hon friend the minister for his generous time discuss the matter we can however hold different feeling at the same time and while approve of the plan feel lot of anger and frustration at what have happen to my constituency joint venture of private capital through sir jim ratcliffe ineos and the chinese state call petroineos have close the grangemouth refinery hundred of worker on site and thousand in the wide supply chain be to lose their job scotland no long refine our oil and fuel and national security have be weaken as result everyone be aware that the previous conservative government do not want to know about that issue and the current snp government try their very good to conceal their knowledge of the closure year ago so while my government have commit million from the national wealth fund for new industry to come at some point down the line that frankly be not enough at grangemouth we have see another unjust transition four decade ago it be the miner who be cast aside now it be refinery worker understand why oil and gas worker in the north east of scotland be anxious and they have every right to be the last four decade of privatisation have also highlight the danger of private capital and foreign government ownership of our vital industry at grangemouth conversion from traditional oil refinery to plant that would create sustainable aviation fuel be viable alternative to closure and would have mean truly just transition for worker and my local community it would also have help the government meet our ambitious saf mandate and support the uk aviation industry yet conversion be not deem profitable enough for petroineos and the scottish and uk governments both meekly accept the company call the shot with minimal pushback in an example of working class community be let down by the collective political class only yesterday in question to the department for energy security and net zero ask what ownership stake the government would take in future industry at grangemouth be still wait on coherent answer let be clear if there be no government ownership stake take and we surrender all the new greener industry such as saf to private capital the government will have learn no lesson at all from the past four decade and we will never free ourselves from be at the mercy of those who put corporate profit ahead of our country need early today the chancellor say that she and the secretary of state for business and trade be not ready to let working class community in scunthorpe go to the wall that be why they intervene to save steel there and that be absolutely the correct decision however the chancellor and the secretary of state should have treat the refinery worker of grangemouth in the same way as they do the steelworker of scunthorpe urge the government to take responsibility and to take ownership of vital industry in our national interest take this opportunity to wish everybody across the house happy carers week it be pleasure to speak on second reading of the sustainable aviation fuel bill know that many member think that make my speech up as go along but want they to know that write this in advance and do not wing it member will also be happy to know that that be my last joke in this speech will just say quickly to the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor that he should never apologise for use an equation in speech as member across the house will be aware although do not have an airport in my constituency harlow start at the very end of the runway at stansted airport and thousand of its resident work at the airport in variety of role briefly pay tribute to the work of stansted airport college in invest in train the local workforce as the minister be aware stanste be part of manchester airports group which be focus on the development of saf like this government the group recognise that saf be the future will also briefly give plug for the harlow group which be involve in machine vital aircraft component and so be in line with the airport on that as member will recognise the uk have world class aviation sector and proud history in the field from mitchell to morien morgan be proud that this labour government be promote growth as well as decarbonisation in the sector saf will help we deliver our clean energy mission and our growth mission allow the uk to be world leader in the field once more compare with fossil jet fuel saf will reduce gas emission by around and we can all welcome that the bill will introduce revenue certainty mechanism to provide price guarantee for saf producer the government believe that that will increase investor confidence in saf production and have speak in depth about the issue with stansted airport it be clear that that be the stumble block for great saf production and use in conclusion welcome the bill and the government ongoing commitment to decarbonisation and tackle climate change also welcome their commitment to be world leader in the field thank my hon friend for give way right at the end just like he welcome the announcement as we hear from across the aviation sector there be much to be champion in the transition to sustainable aviation fuel that will be enable by the bill although collins aerospace in my constituency do not produce saf it do develop the component and system that mean that saf flight be reality do my hon friend agree that that back both the green transition and the industrial future for place such as our region and wolverhampton and willenhall thank my hon friend for her contribution she manage to get in just before my last word so shall have to make up new conclusion absolutely agree with her point the point be go to make in my conclusion be that this bill be really important for climate change and meet our decarbonisation target we all know about the impact of climate change on the planet that we live on and we only have one planet so we have to get this right she be right to say that there be also massive economic advantage to this be really proud to mention two aviation pioneer from the united kingdom early and think this country should be ambitious we should once again be at the front of the queue when it come to aviation technology and aviation pioneer saf be huge part of that this be not just about climate change it be also about job and opportunity and be really excited that this will mean more job and opportunity for my constituency of harlow as well as for wolverhampton be delighted to support the bill today and look forward to hear many more contribution also look forward to this government continue with their fly start it have be say by the secretary of state and echo across the chamber that the uk have world class aviation sector that be key to growth in our economy welcome the introduction of the bill as it will provide certainty for producer of sustainable aviation fuel allow the sector to grow and invest we all know the benefit that airport have for our community which be why my hon friend the members for doncaster central sally jameson and for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher will welcome the chancellor investment in doncaster sheffield when we think about airport we may automatically think about heathrow gatwick luton birmingham and manchester however as east midlands airport be in my constituency of north west leicestershire it will be no surprise to anyone here that that be the airport automatically think about the airport provide huge benefit to my local economy as well as make an important contribution to the wide uk economy as the second large air freight terminal in the uk east midlands serve as the hub for dhl ups fedex and royal mail this growth be back by investment in the nearby east midland rail hub which transport our good from port to port in addition the airport serve as base for rvl specialist airline that provide support to the environment agency and the maritime and coastguard agency the transition to sustainable aviation fuel be go to be key if those organisation be to grasp the nettle on net zero my airport also serve million of passenger every year with the like of easyjet and tui operate out of it support my constituent and those from those across the midland to take well deserved holiday have meet representative of recently know that there be huge support for the introduction of the revenue certainty mechanism and it will be interesting to hear more about the transitional arrangement to ensure that airline such as have the fuel they need to decarbonise and meet the mandate mix over the short term as well as to see the saf industry develop for the future as east midlands airport thrive cargo facility extend to meet the demand of exporter from across the uk cut greenhouse gas emission via sustainable aviation fuel will not only have significant benefit for net zero but will put an estimate billion year back into our economy by it will also create additional job secure long term sustainable future for the industry it also put forward clear commitment to job at the airport which will benefit my constituent and those of neighbour mp in the east midland would welcome assurance from the minister that north west leicestershire will see the full strength of these training and work opportunity when they come about because we have lot to offer know that the measure in this bill alongside the work announce to modernise airspace will be welcome by the sector may take this opportunity to invite the minister to the birthday party of east midlands airport on july notice that that be an exclusive invitation just to the minister like my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince say the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor should never be ashamed of be geek of any kind definitely do not have his knowledge of formula or anything like that but certainly be self profess aviation geek who have spend probably far too long sit at the end of runway watch plane land for hour on end when be in high school use to cycle with one of my friend who live close to the end of edinburgh airport runway to just sit and watch aircraft come in to the point that one time the police come along and ask why these two year old be sit at the end of the runway watch aircraft land can assure everyone that nothing untoward or illegal be happen we be just be that sad and geeky think that be the problem the police have they do not believe that that be what two year old be intend to do would challenge the hon member commitment to aviation spot if during university he do not take date to the final approach at heathrow airport and have she observe the flight come in for good two hour he may be geek but he be not quite there yet it would rather depend on whether the date end up marry he would it thank the hon member for that intervention will not ask for second intervention on how that relationship progress aviation be critical part of our national story and our economy as other have say as an island nation we rely on the maritime and aviation sector to get good and people in and out of our country so it be clear that aviation must continue to play role in our future in scotland and in my constituency that include the movement of product like salmon and whisky as well as tourist to and from dunfermline and the rest of scotland however with aviation expect to become the large transport sector emitter of carbon by it be clear that range of transformational long term change be need in the sector to make it sustainable recently have the privilege of host sustainable aviation technology showcase in parliament with company such as airbus boeing easyjet international airlines group and other include some of the one that have be mention there see technological solution range from radical change to aircraft design to hydrogen power aircraft as well as number of saf producer have also hear from edinburgh airport one of the large employer in my constituency of the importance of airspace reorganisation and regulatory change all of which will have role in modernise aviation and reduce the environmental impact know that the minister have be relentless in pursue all these avenue to improve aviation in the uk and we should thank he his official and the ministerial team for that work and commitment for all those people from different part of the aviation ecosystem the issue of saf have be prime on take office this government take action much fast than many expect with the introduction of the saf mandate it obligate company supply fuel to airline operate out of the uk to either incrementally increase the amount of saf in use or pay buy out fee that mandate start at and will rise to in and to in that be the kind of direction and steer that the industry need but it will mean nothing if we do not produce saf in the uk and invest now in the much long term plan for third generation saf to make that reality here and to make the uk world leader in this technology as well as play part in the future of our fledgling hydrogen sector develop strong saf industry be major industrial opportunity for the uk as other have say the uk can lead the saf industry with job creation and innovation at the event mention airbus tell that it be commit to enable saf capability across its aircraft production by accord to the back british saf campaign there be potential for over job in the uk by and job by number of which would be in scotland and in my constituency as well as in the constituency of other member across the country in due course hope that some of that might include investment in different part of the saf infrastructure in fife with proximity to edinburgh airport and excellent sea road and rail link for these and other reason be delighted to see the bill come forward it clearly set out the revenue certainty mechanism and the framework for set strike price that will support business and investment case to make saf reality in the uk it also establish the route for funding via levy on supplier along with enforcement and oversight hope the minister might respond in his summing up to few specific point some of which have be mention by colleague under clause what process do he intend to use to shape precise price point for producer and to calculate the market reference price clause on financial penalty contain provision to amend amount in the light of inflation be those the only circumstance in which penalty amount can change under clause what oversight do he envisage if financial assistance be require to ensure value for money clear and stable policy framework like this saf bill will be essential to unlock private investment accelerate saf supply chain and position the uk as global leader in the net zero transition but the pace at which the legislation be introduce will be key so will the minister consider what step he can take to accelerate the creation of successful saf industry here in the uk as my hon friend the member for falkirk euan stainbank ask early will the minister begin work to create strike price contract so that they be ready as quickly as possible when the legislation be pass will he consider move the start date for the revenue mechanism forward to allow project to get start as quickly as possible the bill will be significant part of the future of british aviation british industry and british growth look forward to see its progress through the house welcome the bill particularly the introduction of the revenue certainty mechanism which be not only sensible intervention but timely one it give investor clarity it give producer confidence and it give community such as mine sense that this transition will bring job rather than take they away thank ministers for listen not only to the sector but to those of we who represent teesside in our region we have number of producer with an interest in scale up saf production principally alfanar which have already invest billion in our region and want to go much far by build brand new plant that will create construction job and permanent job alfanar be not alone however we also have iogen willis nova pangaea abundia arcadia and many active producer or other look to scale up serious player with serious plan speak to one early this week it say that the bill be exactly what the industry be look for may put just couple of question to the minister what those producer need now be confidence that enable work for final investment decision can begin ideally before the bill complete its full legislative journey of course there be precedent for that in the energy act what engagement will the minister have with the department for energy security and net zero on the carbon capture track project know that number of the producer be keen to benefit from track expansion so produce those two thing in train seem like sensible thing to do and hope that there be cross departmental engagement ultimately thank the government and urge they to move at pace to deliver the job that we want for the industry in our region want to ensure that young people watch from working class community across teesside know that these be not abstract opportunity that be distant from they but opportunity for they that they can get into like our expansion in skill training this sector can be transformative for the tees valley region not only for middlesbrough but for redcar and cleveland stockton darlington and hartlepool our area suffer industrial decline for many decade but now we be see new life and new industry finally teesside be take off call chris mcdonald for the final back bench contribution we hear early from my hon friend the member for doncaster central sally jameson how proud the people of doncaster be of their airport but challenge she to pride in your local airport competition because nowhere be more proud of its local airport than teesside to the extent that whether politician promise the continuation of flight from teesside to alicante be the most important issue in local politic quite right too because work people in teesside save all year round for their seven day in the sun and that be important to and to everybody else who live there people who say that we need to reduce flight and the opportunity for work people to go on holiday be not live in the real world they be certainly not talk to the people talk to and live with support the right of my hon friend stockton north constituent to go on holiday to alicante equally in my ealing southall constituency of people include be bear in different country do he agree that they have the right to go home and visit family and friend so it be important that we accept the reality of air travel and focus our time and energy on realistic plan such as the one before we to invest in sustainable air fuel could not agree more as my hon friend the member for dover and deal mike tapp say we be indeed an island nation if anyone have not spot that and the quick way to get about be to go by air what everyone want be to wake up on morning in stockton and then be sit on beach in benidorm by lunch time and of course they can do that at teesside airport the people of teesside know that our future be about decarbonise this government have invest billion in carbon capture and storage we have the large offshore wind monopile factory in our area and we be produce green hydrogen in billingham in my constituency in fact billingham produce of the uk hydrogen and billingham and teesside more generally be set to become europe main centre for sustainable aviation fuel be sure that sustainable aviation fuel will be produce in grangemouth humberside the north west and south wales but the market be enormous and as we hear from my hon friend the member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland luke myer teesside and billingham in my constituency be well place in the whole of europe to deal with this the big threat to that at the moment be not the fantastic plan of this government but the ideological adherence of member of reform to anti net zero as usual find myself in this house stand up for new job for industrial community in my area alongside my hon friend the member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland where be the reform member they be not here they be never here as well as the welcome development that my hon friend allude to in the tees this be about the wide north east in my constituency wastefront have million investment and be create good job on the river wear do he agree that job be be make in the wide north east through this government policy and that they be under threat from the policy of opposition party that he mention agree whether it be in sunderland or as mention the north west and down in south wales we will see job in the supply chain throughout all this work it will also benefit heathrow and our other major airport hub think it might be useful to make few comment about why believe saf be the solution the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor give great description of why the flight range equation essentially drive we in the direction of sustainable aviation fuel electrification certainly would be possible for short haul flight but the hydrogen simply do not have the density as think the hon gentleman also say infrastructure be important we hear that from the secretary of state in her opening statement because plane take off from one place but they land somewhere else and they need to be able to refuel there too sustainable aviation fuel be certainly the right approach but couple of member raise concern in the debate about the raw material for feedstock my hon friend the member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury raise that issue the hon member for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson say that he have learn about second generation sustainable aviation fuel it be probably just as well that he be not in his place because might blow his mind when talk about third generation and fourth generation sustainable aviation fuel essentially there be concern about the raw material and municipal waste although the amount of waste per person will decline lot of it be put into energy from waste plant and the new investment be really about future generation of saf we have hear about biomass if that biomass be not from feedstock perhaps that verge into the second generation but it be third generation and fourth generation sustainable aviation fuel that will enable we to scale up this industry that will open it up to the direct combination of carbon dioxide and hydrogen use green electricity which will enable we to scale it up an abundant supply of those raw material be need which be why be so confident that we will see the industry spread around the whole of the uk why do say billingham will become the uk and european centre for this work there be justification teesside already produce of the uk hydrogen and the chemical cluster there be well know for produce pharmaceutical for fertiliser and various other chemical we produce synthetic petrol in billingham in the and we produce synthetic jet fuel there in the for the royal air force during the second world war say that not to imply in some way that we still have the skillset many of those people be quite rightly enjoy their retirement or have perhaps move on from that but to demonstrate to the house that there be not big technological risk associate with this technology third generation saf will rely on the fischer tropsch process which have be around for year in fact when talk to investor in the industry and ask they what the big risk be they highlight economic risk with which the government be get to grip right now through this legislation and political risk which be about the consistency of government policy as mention early the big threat to these job and to this industry be the ideology of the reform party as we see the job and investment be confident that people in my local community will vote for job and investment in the future as well as such warmly welcome this legislation very much look forward to the day when can welcome right hon and hon member to teesside international airport and enjoy drink with they in the bar before we jet off to alicante for our holiday call the shadow minister before begin draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests with respect to donation from fuels although it do not make aviation fuel it be in the synthetic business and as the minister well know run classic land rover on that fuel last summer to prove the point that this stuff work the test that net zero must meet be that all our constituent must still be able to do everything they do today be it fly on holiday drive or get ferry or anything else that run on liquid hydrocarbon and that business must still be able to move good around the world and trade at the same price as today or for an equivalent price just green in that technology be our friend as be the innovation we see particularly on these shore but also innovation that be happen abroad as my hon friend the member for orpington gareth bacon the shadow secretary of state say early in the debate the opposition do not seek to divide the house on second reading this bill be an extension of the previous government agenda in this regard and we fully recognise the need to replace fossil fuel over time and in this instance to replace aviation fuel with clean green alternative however there will be key question that the house should look at as this bill go through committee and its later stage which do need answer we have hear some of those question throughout this afternoon debate we have have good and wide range debate with very little deviation from the core consensus that sit underneath the bill on the conservative benches my hon friend the member for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson make the important point that aviation will be critical to get the tourist into the new universal theme park in bedfordshire when it eventually open he also focus on the important role that cranfield university and industry in his constituency be play they be provide part of the solution to the problem that this bill seek to support and deliver equally he ask the legitimate question of how the united kingdom mechanism and mandate compare with those overseas which hope the minister will reflect on in his wind up speech on the government benches the chairman of the transport select committee the hon member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury speak well and in an informed way on this subject she and both serve on the transport committee in the previous parliament and we both work on the inquiry and report on the fuel of the future that the committee produce during that parliament she rightly make good point about the supply of waste for saf technology and the trade off with energy from waste facility for example there will have to be some conversation within government particularly with the ministry of housing communities and local government about the way in which so many council include my own in buckinghamshire now send all general waste to an energy from waste facility those incinerator and facility have be finance through multi decade deal and if we be to get that waste into saf production some of those deal will inevitably have to be undo or renegotiate who will bear the cost of that the hon lady equally raise an important point about bioethanol do not know whether it be just shadow ministers who receive an email from vivergo fuels this week or whether it be all member of the house that email give pretty stark warning particularly about the impact of the us trade deal that the government have do on the bioethanol space essentially it warn that that deal could completely undermine the uk bioethanol industry that be serious concern that the department for transport and the department for business and trade will have to work out if we be to have domestic bioethanol production as much for sustainable aviation fuel as for petrol we largely all fill up unless we have classic car with at the pump be still bioethanol as this bill pass through the house and as the petrol debate for road car move on that serious question will have to be answer when we get warning from industry as stark as the one from vivergo fuels it need to be address the hon member for north somerset sadik al hassan mention the role of hydrogen in the mix and look forward to debate that with he when he have debate on this issue in westminster hall next week think he be absolutely right that there be other technology and other fuel out there the hon member for derby south baggy shanker correctly point out that there can be no net zero without many of the element of this bill the hon member for doncaster central sally jameson speak passionately about doncaster airport and the sustainable future that the bill will help bring about the hon member for falkirk euan stainbank speak in support of the bill and the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun lillian jones speak in an informed way about saf production which form such an important part of the bill the hon member for norwich north alice macdonald rightly speak of the innovative landscape although the drone taxi do worry little bit be not sure we have completely get good be deliver properly by drone yet so we should do that before we start put people in they equally she rightly speak about the world lead engineering job that will be create the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman slightly break the consensus but he be entirely right to speak up for his constituent and his constituency interest so passionately think there be legitimate debate about the refinery that we have lose the refinery that we still have and how this debate intersect with they will not dwell too much on the pun of the hon member for harlow chris vince think he be teacher before he enter this house but perhaps he also write for bobby davro give some of the pun he come up with for the benefit of young member bobby davro be comedian the hon gentleman show my age and no doubt his own with that sedentary interjection the hon member for harlow be right to focus on the skill agenda that underpin this legislation on which do not think we have hear so much from the government likewise the hon member for north west leicestershire amanda hack rightly point out the live experience of and the impact on cargo we have hear lot in this debate about move people around the country and the world use aviation but not so much about cargo which be an equally important part of our role as global trading nation the hon member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie put aside his little geek off with the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor be right to focus on that agenda of move good as well as people we also hear from teesside with the hon member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland luke myer and the hon member for stockton north chris mcdonald in fact be little worried this morning be in westminster hall with the hon member for stockton north for debate on the space industry in which agree with every word he say and be bit nervous to say that agree with he this afternoon too that do not often happen in this house but he be absolutely right that all our constituent work hard and save hard they want that family holiday or that weekend away or whatever it be every single year and it would be gross dereliction of duty for any of we to lumber they with high airfare or to try to make their holiday more expensive that be not what any of they send any of we here to do they want we to ensure that they can still live their life in the way they wish briefly the hon member for sutton and cheam warn we that he might be boring but uncharacteristically for liberal democrat he actually be not laughter very much enjoy his speech and the knowledge that he bring from his year of work in the aviation sector the hon member for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter be equally right to focus on another matter that few member have raise in the debate the use of saf by our armed force particular the royal air force and the royal navy the use of technology from fuel derive from waste and feedstock to pure synthetic be where think much of the debate will go in the come year in fact the technology to enable we to move on from those feedstock and waste derive fuel already exist in the raf fly plane not on blend of saf but on synthetic fuel make right here in the united kingdom by company call zero petroleum which be mention by my right hon friend the member for goole and pocklington david davis let now turn to part of the agenda on which think we will need to have conversation when the bill go into committee the bill give no detail on the approach to be take regard the specific of the contracting between the producer and the counterparty the government contractor for the strike price in the background material especially that which can be find in the government response to the consultation on the saf revenue certainty mechanism the ambition be largely there and we be not critical of the ambition that sit within that document but it might be beneficial to be sure that the contracting will follow those ambition give that the saf mandate already in force include ringfence mandate for an electro sustainable aviation fuel quota it be critical that esaf project be support equally within the revenue certainty mechanism it be important both to develop uk market for saf and esaf and local production as create by the bill and the mandate and to support and encourage the use of home grow technology for the manufacture of saf and esaf as that not only retain revenue within the united kingdom but leverage huge amount of revenue for future export through technology licensing sadly great many project support by grant from the advanced fuels fund be use foreign technology perhaps could suggest that the government reflect ahead of the committee stage on the possibility of add another ambition to those that they have already set out namely to reward or incentivise the use of uk technology in project support by the revenue support mechanism the house may be surprised to know that despite the various programme of uk government support for saf and esaf aff grant saf mandate and the saf revenue certainty mechanism no uk government body be mandate to support the development of the core technology of fuel synthesis we have great tradition of research and development in this country company such as zero petroleum have be fund entirely by private capital which be largely good thing and also through some of their raf and ministry of defence contract for different reason notably however the aerospace technology institute be the government fund body that should be support saf and esaf manufacturing technology it support everything else include hydrogen and electric aircraft but bizarrely it be not permit to fund saf and esaf technology programme that be huge misalignment in the strategy which hope the minister can address have few key question for the minister and he be show great enthusiasm about answer they we will be spend three day in committee so there will be many more to come only three we can negotiate more be sure interruption the less we hear about the hon gentleman date at heathrow the well be the government able to outline their level of certainty about the cost to taxpayer be there confidence that the levy impose on fuel supplier will not lead to significant rise in ticket price in other word what will ensure that the variance in either direction be not hope not dream and not good case scenario but reality about air fare it would also be helpful if detail could be provide about the expect cost of import saf in comparison with the cost of produce it in the united kingdom if we be impose cost on passenger through levy be it expect that saf can be produce more cheaply in other region or be the policy focus primarily on energy security as have say our view be that we should make the fuel right here in the united kingdom use our technology but in order to get the right price from our technology in the uk it be important that we understand the market overseas can the minister outline what proportion of the saf use in the uk be expect to be produce domestically in the first instance what would constitute success in the first iteration the government have suggest that finance plant cost between million and billion from regulatory perspective what can be do to ensure that plant fall towards the low end of that cost range there be many question to be answer in get the bill right we want to get it right and we want to see sustainable aviation fuel use in our aircraft we will not divide the house today but the test as always be this have the government get it right thank nearly all member no all member for their consideration of the draft bill and for their valuable contribution to this debate be grateful to the opposition for their question and scrutiny and we will make sure as house that we get this right for our nation fully concur with the shadow minister the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith that the liberal democrats have not be boring today and be grateful for their support in this matter have work with the liberal democrats in the past know that they be always with you in the room until the fight break out so let we see how we get on over the next period will the minister congratulate innovator such as my constituent james hygate who be recently award an obe for his work on green fuel over genteel tea and cake as the house can imagine this happen all the time in

support and advice the group represent more than scheme member and be sure many will be watch this debate right now all the argument for fair deal for bcsss member have be hear before so want to take this opportunity to speak as an ex coalminer and as the only member of the bcsss think in this parliament and yes have financial interest in this but feel that be qualified to speak up on behalf of member of the bcsss know that he hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery another ex coalminer be present be sure he will support many of the thing have to say be the last generation of coalminer in my family follow my dad my granddad my great grandad and my great great grandad into the pit in nottinghamshire and derbyshire in fact can not think of any male family member before who do not spend some time underground work at four different pit miner will usually say that the good pit they work at be their first pit and my first pit be sutton colliery in ashfield north nottinghamshire start there about year after the miner strike in the it be great pit but this be pit where sadly just few decade early five man have be kill in an explosion go on to do my coalface training at creswell colliery in derbyshire where in yet another disaster have occur boy and man lose their life in an underground fire we have have countless disaster horrific accident and nasty thing go on but still man and boy go down the pit the black hole to do shift dig coal out to fuel our nation it be hard to describe what it be like to work underground there be nothing like it it be dark and dangerous it can be red hot in some place yet freeze cold in other there be no toilet as the hon member for blyth and ashington can tell we we just have to dig hole and then cover it up it be hard to explain what it be like crawl up and down coalface which be inch high and yard long with shearing machine spit out coal dust heat and oil it be horrible feeling it be hard to explain what it be like to carry steel ring on your shoulder girder with your mate on uneven ground and in dusty condition it be hard to explain what it be like to bandage up workmate who have just be trap have have big chunk rip out of he and have lose few finger and half foot he have to be put on stretcher and carry out to the pit bottom on one occasion that be seven mile of the pit seven mile underground that be from here to the edge of london but that be what we do we do that for living day in day out we do moan towards the end of my mining career the last three year of it work as deputy underground be responsible for the health and safety of the man in my district when become deputy be transfer from the mineworker pension scheme to the bcsss do not have any say in it they just put in it that be what they do while we continue work dig the coal to fuel the nation and keep the light on all we ask for be fair day pay for fair day work the pit be long go now but there be still thousand of ex miner and their widow in the coalfield community my constituency of sherwood forest have the second large bcsss membership in the country almost of the membership be woman woman who be formerly employ in the mining industry and woman who be the spouse of member who have sadly die do the hon member agree that it be vital that the government deliver justice for this scheme not only for constituency such our in nottinghamshire but also for woman yes will come on to the woman who work in our industry bit later but the hon lady be absolutely correct all we ask for now that the pit have go we still have the community be fair day pay from our own pot of money that pot of money be the billion investment reserve fund that be our money we pay it in all we be ask be for the government to give it back to we commend the hon gentleman for secure this debate would never have know about what happen in the mine but for the story that he have tell we he have tell those story in debate in this house in the past thank he for his service we congratulate the nationwide building society for do the right thing and share the bonus that it earn with its customer therefore with great respect minister the fact that the government seem to be drag their heel on see mineworker receive rightful dividend from their back break life alter work be jarring and must be address as matter of urgency thank the hon member for his intervention as always he make fantastic contribution and agree with every single word that he have just say the labour party be found on the back of coalminer and think it be time for the current labour government to repay those miner they should remember that the miner pay their union sub they help to bankroll the labour party let we be honest the labour party have supply some good ex mine mp to this house there be one sit there tonight there be one who use to sit over there do not agree with their politic but they be great mp let we remind ourselves that about or woman be part of the bcsss we could not have do our job underground if it be not for those woman who do great job then there be the widow of the ex miner who would love to see few extra quid in their bank account each month when fuel bill be go through the roof about member of the bcsss die every year and there be less than member still in the scheme the hon member and the house will know that be big supporter of return the reserve to the fund particularly because many member be die the hon member sit as conservative member on the government benches for number of year and indeed be deputy chairman of the conservative party while they be in government give the promise that boris johnson make in mansfield in the election why do the hon member do nothing to correct this injustice since so many member of the scheme be pass away each year would he agree that it be somewhat hypocritical to now be champion this issue if the hon member have study hansard and pay little more attention to parliament during the past five year he would know about the representation make in fact have my own adjournment debate on the mps meet the former prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer to discuss the mineworker pension scheme and the miner ask so it be bit unfair of the hon member to try to score point in very serious debate would have hop that he would come here to support in this debate instead of try to score political point do not think it be good look and be sure that the bcsss member in mansfield and across ashfield will not be very happy with his contribution will the hon member give way will make some progress as say there be member leave in the scheme and it will not be that long until there be just few thousand of we leave meanwhile miner and widow die without get the justice they deserve member may find it hard to believe but be year old and be one of the young member in the scheme many member be over year old in fact the average age of member in the scheme be and time be run out for these old collier to get what they deserve will the hon member give way will make some progress it be worth remember that when the last member of the mps die the billion of pound in the fund go straight to the treasury and the government of the day and they can spend that money on whatever they like want to put it on the record that we have see transformative intervention by this labour government on the mineworker pension scheme and over former mineworker already receive their first pension increase in november last year wonder whether the hon member might want to congratulate the government on that innovation if the hon member show little patience he will hear move on to that later the previous labour manifesto state that the reserve fund of both the mps and the bcsss would be release to member yet the bcsss be omit from labour manifesto in maybe the minister can explain why that be she may be aware obviously the hon member for mansfield steve yemm be not aware of this that during the last parliament continually press the government for fair deal on the mps and be knock back at every single opportunity credit where credit be due this labour government have stick by their word and the member of the mineworker pension scheme be lot well off under this labour government due to the extra money in their pay packet time be of the essence while colleague across the house may differ on these issue we represent constituent who continue to suffer from the historic injustice create by the hon member former tory government thousand of miner have die without justice with pass every year this be about fairness and the government have act but do he agree that they be right to resolve this swiftly so that no more family wait in vain for their money think that the hon member be get little confused she probably need history lesson there be labour government for year from the that could have put this right it work both way it be unfair to blame just the conservative government would blame both government to go back to the surplus from the mps thank the labour government for give the mineworker their much deserve reserve fund but gently remind they that they should act to implement the full finding of the business energy and industrial strategy committee report by the way that be reform uk policy sue edwards from ashfield be bcsss pensioner who have ask to keep push on this issue she say that although woman member never work underground their contribution should never be forget sue be right we should never forget the contribution make by woman at our colliery there be about member of the bcsss in ashfield one of they be paddy gumley who will be watch the debate right now he send an email yesterday which say dear lee thank you for your email regard the forthcoming debate on the bcsss we will watch out to ensure that the treasury give sensible answer to your question and hopefully will bring this matter to satisfactory conclusion we be quite happy for you to use our name should you think it necessary again wish to advise you that be now over year old and have recently be treat for cancer so time be of the essence think we all know what paddy mean in plain english please give my money before die none of we be get any young and transfer the investment fund now to member would allow pensioner to live more dignified life in their final year it would also put ten of million of pound back into local coalfield community help local shop and business prosper let we not forget that if these pensioner get this extra money they will be tax on that extra revenue which will go back to the exchequer the trustee have two simple request the return of the billion investment reserve to the member as soon as possible this year and commitment to review how any future surplus will be share out after the investment reserve be return have yet to find coalfield mp who do not agree with those simple request most coalfield be now represent by labour mps and be really hopeful that in the four year they will still be here they will put pressure on the treasury and the government to provide justice for member of the bcsss sincerely hope that many of the labour members in the chamber will be here for more than four year the key point that the hon member allude to be the need for we to work effectively together recognise that as he describe we have whole range of constituent who would benefit from the bcsss be treat differently do he therefore welcome the constructive way in which labour members be work yes like to be constructive the hon member for mansfield have not be so constructive he have use the debate to try to score political point be use the debate to try to get justice for the member of the bcsss the trustee be disappoint by the previous conservative government and they be little bit disappointed with the current labour government who they feel have drag their heal in deal with the bcsss they have deal with the mineworker pension scheme much quick we be all ex mineworker and we should be treat fairly know the trustee have meet the minister today have speak to the chief integrate funding adviser and the feedback be that it be positive meeting and the minister once again appear receptive to the request put forward by the trustee but stop short of say she fully support those request there be very simple solution to all this just give we our money back it be our money and let we discuss the future surplus sharing agreement we ex miner should not be cash cow for the treasury could go into all the fact and figure in this debate but it be simple it be about give back to the mining community what it be owe not only do the miner of the past help create the labour party but they give their money to the cause through their union donation it be time to pay back the miner there should be no excuse let we imagine two brother in their who spend year each down the pit one be in the mps and the other in the bcsss they work side by side underground the brother in the mps have just have uplift in his pension thank to this labour government but the one in the bcsss have have nothing that can not be right it be not fair hear people in this bubble in westminster say that young people would not go down the pit these day but you be all wrong every single one of you in the coalfield community mining hard graft and sense of working class pride be in our dna when the time come for mining community to step forward and go back underground the descendant of our brave miner will do their duty that time will come mark my word in the meantime it be time for this place to deliver justice for the miner would like to hear the minister state from that dispatch box that she fully support the trustee two main request and that she agree that the whole of the investment reserve fund and not just part of it should be share out there be saying when work underground and all the pit be shut it be have we hear owt duck that be what ex miner be say right now to their pit mate so say to the minister who know have be speak to the treasury and the trustee have you hear owt duck thank the hon member for ashfield lee anderson for secure this debate and welcome the opportunity to set out the government position on the bcsss there be lot of hon member in attendance many have long association with the coalfield community they represent and know that this be an incredibly important issue to many people across the country it be also matter of great importance to and be pleased to be speak to the house follow meeting have with the bcsss trustee this afternoon when we speak of the mineworker pension we speak of everyone who have sustain our pit such as my constituent anthony peck who join the scheme age and kevin jowle automatically enrol when he become deputy without any consultation do the minister agree that everyone deserve fair pension and compensation for the billion that the treasury have receive to date we believe that everybody deserve fair pension and totally agree with my hon friend want to set out where we have get to as member will be aware this labour government commit in their manifesto to end the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme and be incredibly proud to deliver on that commitment last october we commit to transfer the investment reserve fund back to member and review the surplus arrangement so that the mineworker who power our country receive fairer pension be incredibly proud that after only three month in power the chancellor announce the transfer of that investment reserve fund at the budget in october this be the action of labour government overturn an historic injustice that the previous government have fail to act on do the minister agree that it be thank to campaigner such as bobby clelland in my constituency and to the local party that we have manage to succeed in have the mps move towards resolution and see that money be pay out to those community in the coalfield in my constituency it be also thank to people such as alan kenney in my constituency who be lead the campaign in scotland on the bcsss hope that she will be able to give we some good news do she agree that this be thank to those former miner who be always stand up for their community and still fight now for the justice they deserve of course my hon friend be right want to thank everybody who have campaign and work for so long on the mineworker pension and everybody who have be in touch with and with colleague across the house on the bcsss one of the most humbling event have be to in my political life be speak to former miner follow the announcement on the mineworker pension be incredibly grateful to the many people who have campaign and who be get in touch and show we how important this be of course we completely understand it this be new topic to personally be contact by constituent whose late husband good friend of mine michael green work for british coal at the time he too be passionate that this money should be return to the miner do the minister agree that we need to get on with this and get this to happen as quickly as possible we be certainly move as fast as we can will explain where the process have get to and hope that member will be reassure the transfer of billion from the mineworker pension boost pension by which be an average increase of week for each member the hon member for ashfield make the point that this be about put money not just into people pocket but into local community and that be incredibly important also understand that in the context of the bcsss in exactly the same way my official be work closely with the trustee of the mineworker pension on the review of the future surplus sharing arrangement and we hope to come forward with proposal and reach an agreement on that soon have work closely with the coalfield community on the delivery of the mineworker pension completely recognise the strength of feeling on the bcsss want to place on record my sincere thank on behalf of my constituent and the people who work in the mining industry across the country for the fantastic work the minister be do in relation to the finance in the mineworker pension scheme might she be able to inform the house what the main difference be between the mps receive the money and the challenge with regard to the bcsss thank my hon friend for his kind word and will do exactly that and set out what the challenge and the difference be have process of work ongoing with the mineworker scheme and work out how we will do surplus sharing we be now work on the bcsss and what we do in that space even though it be not manifesto commitment write to the chief secretary to the treasury in february and secure his agreement to undertake similar review of the bcsss and that review be now well under way the scheme be not identical they be different and the main difference be that there be currently no surplus share arrangement in the bcsss that be because they be remove in follow two deficit valuation the situation at that time mean that member be unlikely to realise any increase to their pension for decade or more and the government risk have to find new money to fund pension change be therefore make and an agreement be reach with the then government that bonus pension increase would be pay for three year and that the scheme would invest so as to ensure that pension could be pay with the aim of return the reserve to the government in that be the main difference meet the bcsss trustee to whom be grateful we be work well together and will continue to do so first meet they in april during which share my determination to move at pace that be government say be it but we will genuinely move as fast as we can on the review and to start that process for the government and trustee and we jointly commission analysis from the government actuary to inform our decision making have hear from many of my constituent affect by the bcsss and many be advanced in age so there be real need for speed appreciate the minister set out how committed she be to get this sort as quickly as possible and would appreciate hear about any further thing she could do to expedite it completely appreciate my hon friend comment think everybody in this house share they and feel that strongly and be committed to do exactly that we have recently receive the analysis from the government actuary on the option for make transfer to scheme member because we receive that information have meeting with the trustee today to hear their view on that analysis at that meeting commit to move at speed my official be meet the treasury tomorrow we be go to put recommendation to the chief secretary to the treasury and make commitment to meet the trustee again before the summer break so we continue to make progress as fast as we can be proud to have support the bcsss campaign since long before become an mp and have continue to support it pay tribute to the campaigner in my constituency include ex miner tony jones who give badge that wear with pride be grateful to the minister for her engagement with bcsss trustee and we as coalfield mp however many of my constituent be often elderly in poor health and desperate for resolution give that the investment reserve be already hold within the scheme and its return would not require any new public spending will the minister continue to work hard to ensure that these defer pension be rightly return as quickly as possible to their rightful owner that be certainly what we be work to do because the two scheme be slightly different the way the treasury have to interact and think about these thing be slightly different but we have do this government actuary process and we meet the trustee today we will now put our recommendation to the chief secretary to the treasury know that lot of my hon friend be talk to he about this issue whenever they can while have desire to move at speed hope colleague will appreciate that we also need to ensure that we get this absolutely right and that any spending decision be carefully consider especially give the role that the government have as the guarantor to both the mineworker pension scheme and the bcsss want to assure all hon member that be do all can to reach an agreement and improve the condition for member as soon as possible the minister have be good today actually at the dispatch box so thank she for that lot of positive thing have come out of this adjournment debate have one question be the scheme run at surplus and if so by how much will not give figure but the scheme be do well that be in part because of the trustee and the action they have take and the investment and process they have undertake while the situation cause there to be change in the way it be manage it be now run well and people can be reassure about that recognise that for many in coalfield community delivery on the mineworker pension scheme have only heighten the sense of injustice about the bcsss hear and feel that and be determined to take action on it for my bcsss member with the scheme look quite healthy now do the minister have that oomph to push it forward and expedite it as quickly as possible to get they justice certainly have oomph yes and be work as fast as can on this will not talk now about the wide support that we be offer people in our former coalfield community but whole raft of government intervention be there to support people my constituent robert ferguson echo many of the point make by the constituent of the hon member for ashfield lee anderson about the difference between family who work side by side whereby one benefit and one do not know that the minister have rather full portfolio there be many other thing that constantly nag she about but will we wait for the treasury which be not know for its speed in make decision or could interim arrangement be put in place to give some of the surplus back to the bcsss or something that allow demonstration of progress while we wait for the chief secretary to come to decision would not want to give the impression that this decision be wait on the chief secretary to the treasury to say yes that be not the case we have to go through the correct process to get it over the line because it be not in the manifesto it be different scheme and we must go through the proper process hope that my hon friend understand that it would probably cause more trouble than not to give part but not all of the surplus back because people would wonder why we be do that we want to resolve this properly and quickly the two outcome that the hon member for ashfield refer to and which the trustee want be goal that we all share but we have to do this properly by go through the right process and ensure that we be not put word into the mouth of our treasury official and colleague before it be right to do so my commitment be to work at pace on this as say my official be meet the treasury tomorrow and we be meet the trustee before the summer have two quick point first as the minister carry out those meeting wish she well will she consider meet some of we from coalfield community to facilitate that conversation secondly she have just touch on the industrial strategy she know my view on the bcsss and its importance to many people in newcastle under lyme that industrial strategy must be feel by people not just in newcastle under lyme but up and down our country
