fylde be far more than coastline countryside and be part of our county history some of the most advanced technology in the world be be develop and build here in fact often when out near warton and freckleton we can hear the jet fighter take off from the site where they be construct while be out on the election battlefield campaign every day it feel strangely reassuring to hear the incredible noise as the fighter jet power overhead to be honest need all the back up could get in the battle to keep fylde blue this time from the defence sector to farming and agriculture tourism and hospitality the care sector and other there be strong local economy however to build on that to create more opportunity for young people and to well connect our business and those seek opportunity

would also like to talk about an important personal area of work that will undertake as member of this house would not be here today would not have survive the journey to this moment without the support encouragement and love of my wife caroline we have be each other strength through good time and difficult one and the fact that caroline have always have the strength to support in such magnitude when she have have her own battle to fight be testament to the person she be caroline like thousand across this country live with what be often know as an invisible disability it mean that she have often conceal just how sick and in pain she be she have have to explain why she be in hospital when just week early she may have be visibly well to everyone and therefore suffer in silence want to champion the work of crohn colitis uk and other charity and organisation that support and advocate for those with disability that be not visible and to help remove the stigma indifference and even hostility that they receive for example when need to use facility mark as for disabled people the hurt and humiliation that can cause only add to the incredible difficulty of live with these condition and we must do much more to raise awareness to conclude fylde be place where some of the most advanced fighter jet in the world be build and it be at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and other technology but it be also place where town from lytham to kirkham and village from stain to singleton still crown the young rose queen each year and hold gala and parade and place where people take pride in look after the countryside and preserve our heritage intend to spend my time in this house fighting for fylde yes for the investment in our future but also the preservation of our history our coastline and our countryside thank you mr deputy speaker for allow the opportunity to give my maiden speech it be privilege to follow so many excellent maiden speech

and for investment in medical research his example should not only give hope to people with parkinson he be an inspiration to we all be new member in this parliament but be privileged to serve in the scottish parliament for year have already observe some of the difference between holyrood and here this institution be old and often more complex as indeed be many of its member and there be many procedure and protocol to learn but while there be difference between the parliaments the purpose we have be common one to serve our constituent we have hear over the past week how it be vital to have strong relationship between the uk government and the devolved administration that be of course true however believe that there be still too few opportunity for member of each of our uk parliaments to work together on many matter of share responsibility and interest hope that there can be great collaboration between all our parliamentarian in the course of the next five year on personal note may say that be proud that my wife claire baker continue to serve the people of mid scotland and fife in the scottish parliament with such skill and dedication be delighted that claire and our daughter catherine could be in the gallery when be swear in have also be greatly privileged to work for disability charity in my time away from elect politic for the past two year have work with the charity enable in role support people with learn disability on campaign for their right not to speak on their behalf but to support they to be their own advocate for change as expert by experience in the medium in public forum and in parliaments enable member ambassador have tell their own story and powerfully argue the case for more equal society the need to tackle these inequality be clear when people with learning disability have life expectancy of year less than the rest of the population only about be in pay employment they have few opportunity in education and they be twice as likely to experience bullying will miss work with they but will not miss the opportunity in this parliament to make our country fairer and more equal place for disabled people will also not miss the opportunity to be champion in the chamber for the people of glenrothes and mid fife the constituency stretch across fife from methil buckhaven and the wemyss village on the coast to ancient markinch and the new town of glenrothes and from kinglassie and cardenden and the village of benarty to lochgelly and kelty those and other community in the constituency have their own history and priority but so many be link by their proud connection to the mining industry that be why the decision by this government to end the injustice of the miner pension scheme so that fund in the scheme be keep for its beneficiary will be so important for so many of my constituent the community of my constituency can look back on proud industrial heritage but it be vital that they can also look forward to their future as hub for innovation technology and our grow renewable sector the biomass plant at markinch the hydrogen for domestic energy pilot at buckhaven and the fife energy park at methil be all example of how our contingency can benefit from the exciting plan for gb energy and our goal for scotland to play lead role in make britain green energy powerhouse we have to seize this opportunity buckhaven and methil have the high number of deprive community in fife which be why we have to realise the ambition for the area and increase employment through expansion in renewable it be vital that uk ministers work collaboratively with management union the scottish government and fife council to ensure that despite the financial difficulty of harland wolff which operate the fabrication yard at methil the skilled job and apprenticeship at the yard be secure along with its infrastructure and facility that skilled workforce and the facility at the yard will be instrumental in realise fife ambition to be thriving hub for the renewable sector in scotland it mean so much to to be give the chance to be champion for our part of scotland my mother be teacher at beath high the school attend by one of our most celebrated novelist sir ian rankin who grow up in cardenden in the constituency in sir ian book set in darkness inspector rebas carry out criminal investigation at the scottish
