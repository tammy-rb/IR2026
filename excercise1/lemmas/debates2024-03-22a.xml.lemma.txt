prayer the chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no beg to move that the house sit in private question put forthwith standing order no and negative hunt trophy import prohibition bill second read relevant document petition ban import of hunt trophy of endangered animal beg to move that the bill be now read second time often in debate that have have long genesis and be consider many time in the house there be that hackneyed phrase everything that need to be say have be say but not everyone have say it one can not even use that phrase now because everyone have say what they need to say many time over of course that be not true in this case not least because of the bill table and pioneer very ably by the hon member for crawley henry smith in the last session of parliament the clear and overwhelming view of this house be that the legislation should go forward we all know that that bill be subject to extend delay in the other house without wish to cast aspersion one could almost suggest delay tactic and eventually time run out have to say that in this regard even if in no other welcome the postponement of the general election until the autumn as hope that will give we more than adequate time not only for the bill to go through its stage in this house but to ensure that the majority in the other place be not frustrate by the few who take different view of it in some way what be happen down there be slightly reminiscent of the debate on the house of lords in the early part of the last century when the lords be very much divide between the hedger and the ditcher between those who accept that some reform be necessary and be therefore go to hedge their bet and allow reform to take place and those who be go to die in the ditch hope very much that the hedger in this case triumph in the other house so that this matter which be very important not just to we but to the public make progress about this time last year on report we reach somewhat of compromise consensus on the bill that leave this place and go to the lords be right in think that the right hon gentleman have reintroduce the exact same bill on which this house reach consensus last year the bill technically do not stop hunt it simply stop the import into this country of any animal protect by the convention on international trade in endanger specie of wild fauna and flora thank the right hon lady for those comment and for the work that she undertake as the secretary of state to support this legislation give that we wish to speed the progress of this legislation hope that colleague will not be prone to make long speech on this issue indeed possibly not even medium or short speech subject to madam deputy speaker intend to be very generous with my taking of intervention because right hon and hon member want to ensure that the strong feeling of their constituent which be make very clear every time this issue come up be express in this house so that those constituent know that parliament be listen and undertake course of action will my right hon friend give way will just finish my comment to the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey before take an intervention from my hon friend from bebington the right hon member for suffolk coastal be absolutely right in the last parliament there be concession and discussion in committee and consensus be bring about which be express very solidly that be why stress that this be the overwhelming view and message from this house to the other house and it be regrettable that the lords choose to ignore that understand that the other house have role in revise legislation particularly when there be deep division in this house but that be not the case with this provision it be absolutely clear that the overwhelming majority include the overwhelming majority of our constituent the figure be or so but will come back to that be in support of the bill the hon member for crawley skilfully put it together which show the bipartisan nature of the legislation that be why it should go through today and why it should be speed through its passage in both houses of parliament the bebington element of the ellesmere port constituency leave about year ago but know my right hon friend have be here long time so it probably be correct when he first enter this place want to make the point that he have just make namely that there be overwhelming public support for this measure number of constituent have contact to express their support as he say time and again survey show huge public demand for this do he agree that it be important that we get the bill through as swiftly as possible so that those in the other place be able to do as much as they can as quickly as they can make no apology for be regularly re elect to this place over number of decade be sure that my hon friend speak effectively for his constituent in ellesmere port and suspect resident in bebington probably hold similar view that be important sometimes issue come before the house that reflect view from certain part of the country there be often argument that reflect the view of those in the metropolis or the inner metropolis and the metropolitan elite but this issue run across party across class and across region this be universal view across the country people want this country to have no part in this vile trade my right hon friend make an important point like many hon member have receive hundred of email from my constituent in batley and spen who be appal at the vile trade of trophy hunting do he agree that the bill will not only prevent the importation of hunt trophy to the uk but it will also send powerful message to country around the world that hunt and kill endangered animal for trophy be always unacceptable and that much more must be do to prevent that atrocious act wherever it occur thank my hon friend for that contribution and for the work she have be undertake on this issue quite apart from the bill she be absolutely right other country include australia france and belgium think there be couple of other have already show the way by ban the trade in hunt trophy and hope that what we decide here will start to send message to other country that this be an international movement as we always realise society and opinion evolve this country have the bullring in birmingham but we no long torment bull with dog in public arena or engage in bear baiting or cock fighting we have move on from that and we need to move on from trophy hunting not least because of the decline in specie some of the argument relate very much to africa but remind colleague pay tribute to the campaign by the daily express on this that other region of the world be also involved such as polar bear in canada the bill demonstrate that the public do not want those magnificent creature to be slaughter not only for bizarre form of pleasure but to decorate people house they do not understand it congratulate my right hon friend on bring this bill forward be it not the case that this legislation be support by campaigner in many country include in africa they love their animal and recognise that there be much more to be gain and it be much more profitable to keep these animal alive rather than to allow this barbaric practice my hon friend be clearly speak on behalf of her constituent in nottingham in express those strong view in number of programme yesterday point out that for the long term sustainable future of tourism in these country it be much well to have tourist shoot animal with camera rather than with rifle and crossbow we need to look towards future of sustainable specie and people be able to enjoy these animal not just through historical video from david attenborough but by visit themselves that give rise to great and long term industry agree with everything that the right hon gentleman have say as well as pay tribute to my sussex colleague my hon friend the member for crawley henry smith for have persevere with this issue for so long we should not be here this legislation should have go through already have be strike by the number of email have have from my constituent about how important this matter be so may make practical offer to member of the house of lords who be minded to try to sabotage the bill again speak as the chairman of the all party parliamentary group for photography and we will have special category in the exhibition this year for wildlife photo so that those member can show how brave and manly they be by get up close with camera rather than gun be that deal be not sure their knee could take it but that be further matter absolutely take the point that the hon gentleman make and he be right about expand the scope so that people can show their skill in photography and show these magnificent creature in their natural environment that be the record they should have not some grisly trophy on the wall fully understand his point be also pleased that the hon gentleman raise the question about colleague be here today realise where we be in the electoral cycle and that we have election everywhere across england and wales in may many colleague will therefore want to be out campaigning so thank colleague who be here today and hope they will be able to participate to put across their constituent view hope that constituent understand the effort that sometimes have to be make to be here on friday give constituency pressure think it be the distressing case of the killing of cecil the lion that alert many people to what be happen too have many constituent in chipping barnet who want this bill to go through that be why be here today to support it thank the right hon lady for come in today particularly because there be even more important election take place in her part of the country she and might take slightly different view on they but we be unite on this issue today it be important that we stress once again the cross party support for this important measure early highlight the role of the hon member for crawley but also pay tribute to many of those who play part in keep this campaign go over many year think of my old friend bob blizzard the previous member for waveney he be comrade in the labour government whips office back in the day before the election he be great friend and also great enthusiast both for jazz but also very much for this cause after he have leave parliament he encourage to take up this issue and his involvement in the campaign to ban trophy hunting be enormously important along with the campaign current director eduardo gonçalves who be sadly not well hope he will be cheer by the progress of the bill later today that be along with number of celebrity sir ranulph fiennes have most notably be stalwart in the campaign as have dr jane washington evans and peter egan who initiate the petition lord mancroft in the other place say what the government be do today be pass socialist legislation which be an odd thing for conservative government to be do official report house of lords september vol do my right hon friend agree that this be not socialist legislation or conservative liberal democrat scottish national party or plaid cymru legislation this be humane and compassionate legislation well we be broad church if member on the government benches wish to join the cause of socialism welcome they my hon friend be absolutely right some issue divide we on non political ground and member from different party end up in the same camp and many of those issue be subject to free vote this issue unite we and it unite we with the british people it should have be sort out age ago it be really shame that we have to be here today do not in any way resent it because this be the right thing to do but this legislation should already be on the statute book thank the right hon gentleman for give way and pay tribute to my hon friend the member for crawley henry smith today feel bit like déjà vu we be back here again but that send message to our friend in the lords that we will not give up this legislation be the right thing to do it be an abhorrent act to go to another country and kill an endangered animal in order to stick its head on wall it seem like something from totally different century the fact that we be back again fight for the right cause and stand on the shoulder of the giant who have go before we send an important message to both the house of lords and the country thank the hon gentleman for that he express particularly well his point that trophy hunting be like something from previous century its time have pass life move on and society move on as be describe it be interesting in the interview do that none of the commentator could respond when ask how can you defend someone who want to travel distance to shoot giraffe stand on its corpse and bring part of it back to this country nobody seem to be able to answer that question be not say it be ever right to do that but what be absolutely clear now be that the british public be certain that they do not want any part of it my right hon friend make very valid point some in favour of trophy hunting argue that it lend itself to support conservation in the country which seem to an entirely spurious argument we have just see really promise figure on tiger there be in the wild now that be actually tiny number there should be many thousand more but it show that conservation effort can pay off if we focus on certain specie trophy hunting be not about conservation as my right hon friend say it be about people shoot animal take picture of themselves parade around the corps and cut the animal head off to take home it be an abhorrent act absolutely agree my hon friend have be campaign on this in bristol and here in parliament for many year from the day when we work in the whips office she make very strong point the argument that say we be kill these animal in order to save they be bit like say we create desert and call it peace really do not buy into that and importantly neither do the british public there have in the past be the argument that trophy hunting perform the role of cull for protect specie we have always be able to negate that argument there be time when there be strategy for cull certain specie but that be do on the basis of scientific fact rather than inhumane delight at the killing of animal my right hon friend make an important point vastly excessive number such as in certain part of this country where there be problem with deer have an impact on woodland and the very proper campaign by the government to reforest the country in many case professional hunter do the cull rather than have people fire crossbow at animal which can then linger for several day cecil the lion be mention that case catch the attention and imagination of the british public and it focus they on this issue and they make it clear that they do not want this practice to continue my right hon friend be absolutely right but there be another factor to consider the elephant take out be the big leader of the tribe that have significant effect on the gene pool there be already some evidence that elephant with small tusk be survive and therefore contrary to natural selection change be take place to their appearance also some hunter do not seem to accept that although some be solitary many animal live in social structure we see that with the death of cecil the lion and we see with elephant that the social structure and cohesion of elephant herd be completely disrupt that apply to other creature as well hunting be to the detriment of gene selection and the development and maintenance of group of specie wholeheartedly support my right hon friend bill as in the title of the bill these people be after trophy they will not select the weak in the herd or the pride they will go for the one that look the most magnificent on their wall or wherever they want to display it therefore they be take out the strong weaken the gene pool and have exactly the opposite effect on conservation that be another reason why we need to send strong message and support my right hon friend bill my hon friend be absolutely right the negative impact on the specie as whole have to be consider especially as my hon friend the member for bristol east kerry mccarthy say because we be see real reduction in some specie we be get below the critical mass necessary to sustain the genetic variation of healthy specie will the right hon member give way will just make little progress because mention one of the campaign organisation and if take intervention before mention the other they might think be leave they out pay tribute to the many campaign that have maintain interest in this issue over the year bring we hope to the culmination today humane society international lionaid four paw and bear free have all play prominent role in contact member and campaigning there be also the coalition against trophy and canned hunting which include action for primates law animal defenders international animal aid animal interfaith alliance catholic concern for animals the conservative animal welfare foundation again show the bipartisan nature of the support international wildlife bond labour animal welfare society onekind people for nature and peace protect african lions quaker concern for animals the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals world animal protection wildlife conservation foundation and zimbabwe elephant foundation if have miss anyone out they can text and might include they in the wind up those organisation have work together successfully to highlight the issue and we pay tribute to they totally agree with the right hon member on that point support the bill because stand with many of my falkirk constituent who have write to on the issue he mention many of the non governmental organisation have be heavily involve with four paw in the uk which have provide so much useful information to on the subject over long while as we all know this be non partisan issue mp from all corner of the house have speak at great length and passionately on the totally incomprehensible nature of this brutal sport enough talk the time be to make this actually happen do he agree that kill animal for sport be just not an acceptable practice the hon gentleman make that point strongly and stress once again the all party support for the measure congratulate my right hon friend on bring the bill forward fully support it and will be vote for it today he outline an impressive list of organisation do not think anybody have mention that apparently nine out of of the british public support the ban and that be something the house of lords need to take note of have just be look through the list of email have have on the subject from right across my constituency from chorlton didsbury burnage and withington from all kind of different demographic group and area around the country the british public be absolutely united in want this trade ban thank my hon friend for that point and for highlight the level of support of course that be reinforce by the government themselves in january in their response to the petition instigate by mr peter egan which say we will continue work to deliver our manifesto commitment to ban the import of hunt trophy from endangered animal which have overwhelming support from mps and the public we recognise that this be an issue that the public feel very strongly about and over of response to our consultation support further action in the previous parliamentary session the government fully support the hunting trophies bill during its passage through parliament the bill pass the house of commons in march with strong support from mps but do not progress through committee stage in the house of lords we will continue work to deliver this important manifesto commitment hope the minister will be able to back that up far in her contribution later on that be reinforce in reply at the end of january to letter from number of member across the house that the hon member for crawley organise in which the minister once again say that there be considerable debate and that the government support the bill and share the hon member disappointment that it do not pass through the commons it be absolutely clear that whatever our other division we be unite in support of ban there be one particular aspect that want to highlight we have talk lot about hunting in the wild but there be the even more deplorable business of so call canned hunting where animal especially lion be breed in an enclosure to be shoot by depraved individual who want trophy pay tribute to lord ashcroft again someone with whom might disagree on other issue who have spend considerable amount of time campaign on and instigate research into that appalling trade hope the bill will help reduce the attraction to such trade one firm involve in that dreadful trade advertise that your hunt be never complete until you receive your animal at home for you to reminisce and re call your experience for the rest of your life do we really want to be associate with people who take that sort of attitude have take fair amount of time and number of intervention we could go on lot long and in lot more detail but recognise that the house will want to make progress and that colleague will want to make what hope will be brief contribution will the right hon gentleman take we through the clause of the bill clause be incorporate as result of the acceptance of one of my amendment when this bill be last debate clause have not yet be explain and would be interested to know whether the right hon gentleman support it and how he think it will work in practice thank the hon gentleman who sit with on the british american parliamentary group we be joint officer consider he parliamentary friend thank he for highlight the fact that the bill be amend to take account of various view it be carry forward without dissent in this house and be forward to the lords that be precisely why the bill should be vote on again send back to the other house and incorporate into the law of this land it be great privilege to follow the right hon member for warley john spellar pay tribute to he and to many other member from across this house who have work so hard not only in support my bill when it be before the house last year but in campaigning to end the importation of hunt trophy the body part of endanger specie to this country it have be fantastic effort as we have hear the bill enjoy the support of well over four fifth of the british public indeed there be commitment to do what the bill propose in manifesto on which stand for election four and half year ago and understand that that commitment have be reflect in the manifesto of many other party represent in this house last march the hunt trophies import prohibition bill that introduce pass through this elect chamber unanimously as we have hear from my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope we accept compromise amendment to make sure that it reflect as many view as possible when it go to the other place very small minority of peer act discourteously in the way that they seek to block the legislation that be why we have have to bring it back and be grateful to the right hon member for warley for do so mention the widespread support for this legislation in this country but it be also extremely popular in other part of the world southern africa have be mention last year be in number of southern african country where there be clear desire among the majority of people to make sure that such legislation be enact in this country and as the right hon gentleman say in other country as well hunt for trophy be not natural practice for people in southern africa it be colonial import to the continent from the time of colonisation it be not native the ending of this practice enjoy widespread support across the world as the right hon member for warley say the practice that we be discuss be not unique to africa claim have be make that somehow this be racist legislation that tell country around the world how to act and conduct their hunting policy let we just remind ourselves that this bill be import legislation it say that we in this country by clear majority choose not to allow the importation of body part of endanger specie slaughter by hunter to great britain that be the territorial extent of this bill and what it be design to do nevertheless it would send strong signal that these practice be deeply damaging to conservation as he eloquently say damage be do to the gene pool by take out the top animal in pride of lion or the big tusker from herd of elephant that be begin to damage the ability of those animal to survive let we remind ourselves of what this bill be about it be not about ban hunting although might have view on that it be about protect endanger specie before it be too late in my hon friend tour of africa do he have the opportunity to meet president masisi of botswana who have describe western intervention as racist onslaught he have say it racism they talk as if we be the grass the elephant eat it startle when people sit in the comfort of where they be and lecture we about the management of specie they do have have not meet the current president of botswana but have meet the previous one president khama on number of occasion he be passionate about end trophy hunting because it be not typical african community who benefit from it but the big industry that support it botswana be good example because in such country there be huge difference of opinion over whether trophy hunting should go ahead pay tribute to the hon gentleman for the work he have do on this issue be not the answer to the point make by the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope that the bill deal with the import of trophy to the uk and say nothing about botswana the hon gentleman be absolutely correct as say this be import legislation its territorial extent be great britain it be about what we choose to import to this country and clear majority of the british people do not want the body part of endanger specie import here because they care about these majestic specie and want they to continue to exist for the sake of their child grandchild and many generation to come the idea that kill an endanger specie save an endangered species be absurd and should be call out for what it be too pay tribute to my hon friend for the work that he have do on this issue reiterate that it be absurd that we be back here because this house agree unanimously to take this bill through my constituent who be very far away from many of the country in which this practice happen be absolutely passionate about end it however as have be state this bill be not about the practice in those country it be about what we import to our country if we do anything we should make sure that we end this abhorrent act of import the carcase of endangered animal for people to stick on their wall be grateful to my hon friend who have be stalwart in support in this campaign he be absolutely right to remind we again about what the legislation do it be about what we choose to import or not to this country the bill apply to the importation of endanger specie body part no matter where in the world the animal be hunt so it would also prohibit the importation of trophy hunt from polar bear in canada as the right hon member for warley say we do not hear people claim that we be be racist against the canadians because we choose not to import endanger polar bear we need to remind ourselves what the legislation do could speak with passion on this principle for hour but be conscious of parliamentary procedure and do not want to detain the bill passage any far once again call on hon and right hon member from across this elect house to send clear message we in this country choose not to import the body part of trophy hunt endanger specie to great britain all of we here be familiar with the term trophy hunting we have come to recognise the evil act that those two harmless sound word represent but for those watching who may be less familiar with the term animal welfare organisation such as spca international define it as the hunting of animal for sport not for food usually the animal be stuff or body part be keep for display they go on many hunter claim that trophy hunting be bad for animal they say they be support animal conservation the opposite be true live animal support the population of their specie the league against cruel sports say we believe this multi million pound industry be unjustifiable from an animal welfare point of view but also for conservation as it be responsible for endanger several specie around the world as for sport that word be usually reserve for activity that revolve around the more positive aspect of life fitness healthy competition teamwork friendship personal achievement endeavour and endurance not single one of those could be attribute to an activity that involve an individual choose to photograph themselves grin triumphantly as they celebrate kill once gentle and graceful giraffe whose lifeless body now lie slump and twist at their foot pump full of deadly bullet my good friend the vet and animal welfare campaigner dr marc abraham obe agree he say anyone with an ounce of compassion and kindness despair at see these image of cowardly pathetic trophy hunter grin over their still warm kill exploit animal use as pathetic prop to maintain even elevate an online self image of superiority without any shred of guilt or conscience he describe those take part in these killing as have tragic lack of empathy and the high form of narcissism and say that to be complicit in this most extreme callous form of animal cruelty plus then to harvest the body part and ship they back home to the uk could be clear indicator of violent antisocial behaviour every member of this house will have have email and letter from and meeting with constituent who love and value animal and loathe those who exploit harm or kill they there be so many british people who show such kindness who campaign on behalf of animal charity who volunteer who make donation or fundraise and who share love for our planet and the incredible breathtake wildlife that we be so fortunate to benefit from how dare few wealthy individual decide that they have the right to buy and cause the death of lion polar bear or elephant alongside our constituent there be those who use their fame and public platform to fight for the protection of animal those campaigner include frequent visitor to parliament whose passion be infectious people such as the wonderful peter egan friend to many in this place who for year have fight hard to raise awareness and keep ban on trophy hunting import at the top of mps agenda peter work with the fantastic campaigner eduardo goncalves who we talk about early and who be support by many across this house include my right hon friend the member for warley john spellar who have never give up fighting to protect animal during his time here he step down at the next general election but it be vital that we carry on his compassionate work absolutely pledge to do that to the good of my ability no speech about animal welfare should leave out top animal champion ricky gervais he could spend his day polish his many award but instead he choose to condemn trophy hunting and shame those who consider the murder of animal to be hobby he support the ban and have call trophy hunt humanity at its very bad the murder of animal for fun be also condemn by chris packham bill bailey joanna lumley and sir ranulph fiennes as well as mp and activist across the political divide and those with no political affiliation whatsoever the legendary jane goodall say trophy hunting be utterly cruel utterly unnecessary and utterly disastrous from conservation perspective it inflict pain and suffering on animal for no other reason than to boast of some ephemeral prowess there be no material human need meet by it it be hobby pure and simple and deeply wrong one at that urge colleague to support the bill sincerely thank my right hon friend the member for warley for bring it forward echo the word of the humane society and say that there be no excuse for trophy hunting so let we get the ban do the one thing that unite the house be that we all want to see successful conservation but this bill have always be about racism and neocolonialism this bill be question by science and by african country if anybody no matter how much they think they love animal be think about write to or contact about trophy hunting insist that they seriously consider what african representative have say about both the bill and the people who support it over the last year cite list specie of animal have be import as hunt trophy in the same period the pet industry have trade in over list specie if hon member care about cite then perhaps the bill should include pet as well do not believe anybody in the house intend to be racist but this bill cross the line the namibian environment minister pohamba shifeta have write to our environment secretary denounce the bill as regressive step towards neo colonialism your bill imply that your judgment supersede our insight and expertise such unilateral action make without consultation and collaboration with we challenge the sovereignty of nation like namibia we have talk about botswana and will quote what president masisi say it be worth remember that botswana have elephant it now have elephant the population increase year on year by about elephant some trophy hunting licence be issue but those licence have never all be take up when president masisi describe intervention in africa wildlife as racist onslaught on that point will the hon gentleman give way be in the middle of quote but think the president will forgive for allow the hon gentleman to intervene do the hon gentleman agree that the house be perfectly entitle to make decision have consider all the fact not just selective fact it can then decide that it do not want hunt trophy to be bring into this country and it be perfectly entitle to make that decision if do not respect the house would not have bother to turn up today so do not think that be valid point we must consider how we would feel if botswana namibia tanzania zambia south africa or zimbabwe be legislate on what we do here awkwardly for the hon gentleman we be not ban trophy hunting in the uk we be target cite list specie but we do not seem to care that there be such specie of which only handful be actually relevant to continue the namibian environment minister pohamba shifeta say this be regressive step towards neo colonialism whether it be mean that way or not he go on to say your bill imply that your judgment supersede our insight those of the people who actually look after these animal he say such unilateral action make without consultation challenge the sovereignty president masisi say that this be racist onslaught from people who sit in the comfort of where they be and lecture we about the management of specie they do have he be not just speak for himself last november the times the telegraph and the daily mail report that ordinary africans share the president view the paper quote from survey of people in botswana malawi mozambique namibia south africa tanzania zambia and zimbabwe who say that the uk legislation be racist and neocolonial that be what they be say about we although respect the sovereignty of this house would not like it if they say thing like that about we and be astonish that the hon gentleman do do not read the times very often but the hon member say that the african community leader and conservationist he refer to rightly argue that it be not for we in the west to decide how they should manage their wildlife and that that be why he can not endorse the bill be not tell they how to manage their wildlife or demand that they do it in certain way what and many member in this house be say be that we do not want those disgusting trophy in this country it be simple the african country find it appal that british politician show no concern for the african life threaten by these animal they be furious with the virtue signal proposal which lack scientific credibility time and again they return with the fact and they be completely ignore by hon member in this debate will come on to what oxford university say about the fact and figure give by the right hon member for warley john spellar this week botswana minister for environment and tourism along with the high commissioner of namibia south africa zambia and botswana come to this house to express their dissatisfaction with the bill this be significantly different from when my hon friend the member for crawley henry smith bring forward his bill there be no pushback from african country then now we be see significant unhappiness from those country about the bill defra ministers and their labour shadow know that the high commissioner of the six african nation have jointly condemn the bill as inexcusable meddling in africa democratic affair there be in the uk ten of thousand of trophy hunting animal that the bill do not cover if the uk hat trophy hunting it should ban it here first do not particularly want to see that but that be what people in africa feel on second reading of last year bill that propose such ban the minister tell the commons that its purpose be to reduce the impossible pressure on africa wildlife other mp argue that the measure would save thousand of animal from the barbaric and savage african practice of legal hunting indeed the hon member for canterbury rosie duffield use other such adjective but this be misleading in fact mps statement on second reading be analyse in an oxford university study and be deem to be factually incorrect the bill cover specie and most of those be not threaten by trophy hunting since the uk have import about of the specie in the bill that be in year at least specie that the uk import may be or be benefit from trophy hunting rural africa welcome control legal hunting as it help to manage excessive herd and rogue animal furthermore the fee that hunter pay bring significant amount of cash into remote area where tourist and photo safaris can not get to this create incentive for villager to refrain from poisoning snare or shoot the animal between and of concession fee usually go towards community land african know that legal hunting reduce illegal hunting it be the poaching often fund by chinese criminal gang that put at critical risk the survival of the specie that we all treasure those brutal gang be indiscriminate in how many animal they kill by contrast legal hunting estate need and want to grow their herd to ensure the future of their business and that be why they invest heavily in anti poach patrol they provide the armed guard that be vital to protect these animal from gruesome death this legal hunting operate under strict quota agree by national governments and the international regulator as result the herd have flourish one paper find that in kenya where hunting have long be ban there have be dramatic fall in wildlife number another study find that botswana which do ban hunting see horrific surge in human wildlife conflict with increase in the discovery of elephant carcase that disaster lead to quick reversal of the ban in briefing from the international union for conservation of nature state that legal well regulated trophy hunting program can and do play an important role in deliver benefit for both wildlife conservation and for the livelihood and wellbeing of indigenous and local community in letter to the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs namibia minister for environment and tourism say we be most concerned about how this propose law would undermine the finance of our protected areas and conservancies the lack of dedicated land and the protection which protect hunting pay for would critically undermine the survival of specie which we all love he go on to say the implication of this legislation therefore extend far beyond what have become know as trophy hunting potentially impact the livelihood of rural community that rely on the revenue it generate joint statement from southern african government representative in the uk oppose the bill think the hon gentleman indicate that only of trophy have come to this country if it be only enact this piece of legislation will not make that much difference to those country will it it would make enough difference for the hon gentleman to turn up for the debate and for to do so it would also make enough difference for all the representative of those southern african country who care about the creature that we all purport to care about to say that the bill be wrong in fact they say if income stream from trophy hunting be substantially reduce as would be the outcome of this bill land would be abandon and subject to poach or convert to less biodiversity friendly us such as agriculture and livestock production local community who live near and with wildlife would suffer think it be pretty clear that they do not think that the hon gentleman be right the statement end southern africa track record on conservation be world lead and we use trophy hunting to do it let we continue to do so recognise that that be awkward for opposition members who care about animal but the people who be responsible for those animal be tell we that we be wrong botswana be the top country in the world for large animal with namibia second and tanzania third all three country have pay hunting which finance protect space and armed guard for those animal the country that be in the world that be we be in the word of david attenborough one of the most nature deplete country in the world we get rid of the last brown bear year ago and our last wolf year ago africa human population have rise eightfold during our lifetime cause immense pressure on the land available for wildlife that mean that africans increasingly come into conflict with big animal which may eat their goat threaten their child or trample their village last year botswana minister for environment and tourism start an article publish in the daily mail by say last month attend the funeral of two villager in my homeland botswana both be in their teen tragically kill by charge wild buffalo as they travel to school and work sadly this be not an isolated incident she go on to say believe do understand the horror people feel when they see photograph of trophy hunt person pose beside recent kill lion killing in particular seem to cause outrage among britons especially after the notorious shooting of cecil the lion by us trophy hunter in zimbabwe in the widely circulate picture of walter palmer stand over cecil body become emblematic of man destructive relationship with nature reasonable though this reaction be it be knee jerk one it fail to acknowledge that for many africans trophy hunting be vital for the local population it be wildlife conservation measure that generate income use to combat illegal poaching support community development and enhance habitat protection sadly she say we all too often focus solely on animal welfare at the expense of human life in africa have think carefully about the amendment that intend to table the bill do not need to keep come back in the way in which the right hon member for warley have bring it back my amendment will ensure that the bill protect certain specie while recognise that other country may be even well at manage conservation than we be it will allow the secretary of state to add or withdraw country from list of those that issue hunt licence and show sufficient level of concern for conservation any hunting trophy obtain under licence in country that be on the list would be exempt from the ban kenya would not be on the list as it do not allow hunting and its wildlife number sadly have decline but country that do allow it and be do good job should be allow to continue this bill be be question by science and by african country and there be no excuse for blunder into inadvertent racism if we want africa big animal to survive into the future ask the house not to ignore the science and the misinformation that endanger the animal that we care the most about it be an honour to follow the hon member for north herefordshire sir bill wiggin but can not say that agree with single word of his speech he quote david attenborough but david attenborough have describe trophy hunting as incomprehensible and certainly do not support it pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for warley john spellar for present the bill to the hon member for crawley henry smith for his early work and to our depart friend bob blizzard who do an enormous amount of work on this issue when he be member want to make this short contribution because have the privilege of go on safari when my wife and visit africa it be the trip of lifetime if ever have the chance to go back and do it again do not think it will be the same trip because the first experience of see these magnificent beast in their own habitat be something you never forget want to impress that on the people who seek what suppose be the thrill of murder these beast within two hour of arrive at our camp we be in truck be take to look at the wildlife as we sit in that open sided truck lion walk past the bottom of it could look down and see its back as it walk past sit there and think what the hell be do here there be no cage around the truck but you trust entirely the stranger you have just meet the guide who take you around while wild beast only couple of metre away walk calmly past the truck the experience of get close to those animal be something never to be forget but the most memorable experience be see beside the chobe river in botswana herd of elephant feed at dusk talk and grumble to one another as they eat the reed on the river bank we get quite close to these huge beast and feel entirely safe indeed we feel that we be privileged to be so close to they in their natural habitat the idea that anyone would go into that environment with gun and slaughter those animal be beyond if you want to experience wildlife do go murder it get up close to it and experience it in that way ask members to imagine this for minute there be probably about dozen people in our truck if every one of we have gun and go out slaughter these animal the effect across the specie would be enormous but when large number of we go to these country arm with camera rather than gun the effect on their economy be enormous we have hear argument today about be racist towards african country but it be not just about african country have not hear anyone say we be be racist to canadians by not want polar bear to be import in the word of david attenborough this be incomprehensible will the hon gentleman give way be go to give way once but do not want to take up too much time the canadian government have not write to object it be the african country that object to this hope that be clear from what say early be sure it be but the hunting fraternity only contribute to very tiny bit of those country economy what we seem to have hear today be an argument that without the enormous wealth of the people who go trophy hunting conservation can not be afford just do not accept that that be reasonable argument of course people can pay would pay an enormous fee for the privilege of go to see these animal in their own habitat and leave behind that fee in order to pay for conservation there be way that we can contribute to conservation that way outstrip the money that member on the conservative benches have be talk about let we be honest the majority of the people who talk the bill out in the other place be hereditary peer that be the truth of it the enormously privileged wealthy call this idea which have enormous support from all the people socialist well because it have the support of the people it have to be socialist do it it have to be socialist because commoner want it how could the conservative party possibly support measure that be so socialist in its fundamental objective it be complete nonsense but there be specie that perhaps we should be metaphorically hunt to extinction the position of the hereditary peer and their ability to vote on law in our country that be an outdated anachronism that have to come to an end and the person who start that hunt will have my full backing it be pity that in debate that should be about fact the hon member for eltham clive efford have allow his prejudice to come to the fore do not think that help his cause indeed my hon friend the member for north herefordshire sir bill wiggin and agree that it show that we be win the argument because the hon gentleman and some of his colleague be have to resort to smear member of the other place those members table perfectly reasonable amendment the problem be that they run out of time for discussion the previous bill be amend in this place that be only because my hon friend the member for north herefordshire and table large number of amendment which put pressure on the promoter of the bill my hon friend the member for crawley henry smith and the government to accept some of those amendment one of the amendment be to add what be now clause of the bill and another be to remove from the bill henry viii clause allow the subject matter to which the bill would apply to be extend by statutory instrument without any proper consultation this bill be well bill than the one that be first introduce into this place by my hon friend the member for crawley but it be still very defective certainly think it would be much well bill if the amendment suggest by my hon friend the member for north herefordshire in his excellent speech be to be incorporate into its text rise will happily give way if need be be most grateful sorry be little slow to intervene as always my hon friend be make an excellent speech the purpose of the amendment be to ensure that we take any risk of racism away from this legislation because at the end of the day we be unite in want well conservation that be what unite we the disagreement across the house be on the mean to the end everybody want to have well conservation of endanger specie and wildlife in africa like the hon member for eltham have have the privilege of go on safari in africa indeed in south africa on two separate occasion one be in about when it be pretty hard to find the wild animal we be look for in the game reserve when go again about month ago there be an abundance of rhinos giraffe elephant lion leopard and so on we have the most amazing experience people use their camera and they rely on the protection provide by the excellent team that look after and conserve that safari park or game reserve we could see with our own eye that people be try to poach the animal that be be look after and the cost of anti poach measure be incredibly high how will that cost be fund unless it be pay for by the people who be engage in the conservation one small mean by which they raise fund be by allow the collection of trophy and almost all the trophy that be not keep in africa be import into the united states spain or germany very few be bring into this country whatever happen to this bill trophy hunting will continue but it may not include the import of small number of trophy into this country under licensing and regulatory regime that have stand the test of time instead of regulation we will have an outright ban why be we do that the impact assessment in respect of an early bill say why be government intervention necessary government intervention will address public concern about import of hunt trophy from endangered animal essentially the government impact assessment admit that this be about presentation virtue signal and pander to public opinion whether or not that public opinion be sound let we take ourselves back to when the government and parliament take the view that we should abolish capital punishment at that time vast majority of the population take the view that we should keep capital punishment if we have apply the principle that be be apply to this bill we would still have capital punishment because it would address public concern about people be murder we in this house need to rely on science and fact rather than allow prejudice and ignorance to prevail which be one of the reason why hope the bill will be improve if it receive second reading today section of the impact assessment from paragraph onwards refer to the cost of this propose legislation which be the point that my hon friend the member for north herefordshire and be seek to get across to the government the impact assessment say letter from researcher describe how in african country that practice trophy hunting more land have be conserve under trophy hunting than under national parks with hunting area contribute to landscape connectivity some argue that restrict the import export of trophy from hunt risk land conversion and biodiversity loss and other alternative area management strategy must be in place to promote conservation protect endanger specie and support livelihood furthermore many question remain on whether alternative such as wildlife tourism can effectively replace trophy hunting especially in area with poor political and economic stability and area with less aesthetic appeal that be not what be say it be what the government say about the cost of this legislation when they do their impact assessment which go on to say wildlife conflict with local people can impose serious cost include cause physical harm and death damage crop predate livestock and compete with livestock for food where wildlife provide few benefit to local people impose substantial cost animal be often kill for food trade or to remove problem animal that be welcome recognition by the government of some of the reality surround this subject rather than the prejudice of people who have be ill inform by certain organisation in paragraph of the impact assessment the government also concede that evidence suggest that trophy hunting can provide value for animal which incentivise their protection for the purpose of hunt rather than indiscriminate removal land use change to agriculture without trophy hunting an income stream link to positive conservation outcome could be lose and other option need to be in place to address this conflict that be what the government say in their impact assessment so hope we be go to hear from the minister how they will address the concern that they recognise if indeed they be still hell bent on push this legislation through to try to get it on to the statute book the government also concede in their impact assessment perhaps this be point that my hon friend the minister could refer to that ban in the legal movement of animal trophy could have the unintended consequence include increase the illegal trade in wildlife part which be unregulated it could also reduce the amount of protein available to local community as meat be often by product of trophy hunt after hunting ban in in botswana one village lose the provision of tonne of meat so less protein be available to the community this result in an increase in illegal poaching and document decline in wildlife those be fact what be the government response to the fact to which they refer in their own impact assessment in the issue of cost be discuss in paragraph one of the major argument for hunt for trophy be that it provide financial benefit to local community and without trophy hunt these benefit could be lose however the extent to which local community truly benefit be widely debate of course that be the debate we be have today let we not take view that all the people who support this bill be lover of animal and all the people who be against it despise animal nobody could be strong supporter of animal than be indeed my wife and be proud that we have produce daughter who be now veterinary surgeon can one adduce any more evidence of the importance of inculcate into one child love of animal that their parent share let we have none of this nonsense suggest that this be not vile activity and that those who be against this bill should be subject to some sort of vilification that be completely ridiculous let also refer to the letter to which my hon friend the member for north herefordshire refer from the namibian association of community based natural resource management support organisations the letter be send to all british mp and be disappointed that more of my parliamentary colleague who will have see that letter be not present one ask rhetorically what have they do as result of the point make in it mr louis say please do not regard africans as be incapable of decide our domestic policy the reason we have legal hunting be that it pay for protect land for our big animal as our human population grow it be crucial for our lion and elephant to have such space our rhino also require armed guard to safeguard they from ruthless poaching gang finance by chinese criminal when there be no guard massive number of the animal get kill by these brutal gang legal hunting pay for the guard and kill far few when we as family be in south africa we see the consequence of what happen with rhino to try to disincentivise the illegal poaching of rhino the rhino be de horn but such be the value of rhino horn now even from dead animal because of ill conceive ban on its use rhino be now be poach just for that part of the horn that be no long visible which be part of an extension of the head that be consequence an unintended consequence obviously of the restriction on country export the rhino horn from dead animal that be why this be very nuanced debate and be not sure we be get as close to that today as their lordship be when they be debate the legislation on report in their house this very important letter from maxi louis go on to say the evidence for this be in the peer review science which show how successful africa system be at defend our precious animal people who have read this science and back legal hunting include the eu commission be not sure that be his strong argument and george monbiot which be strong argument he continue so do the global regulator the international union for conservation of nature we use legal hunting to manage our big animal because they be mortal risk to we and our child african life be at stake you do not have any dangerous wild animal britain get rid of its last brown bear year ago and its last wolf year ago in his conclusion he say that wildlife in africa be flourish because of our management we ask for no more virtue signal it be arrogant ignorant and racist could not have put it well myself that be why be disappointed that the government continue to pander to those who would fit into the description give by maxi louis turn now to the amendment that be make to the bill introduce in the last session by my hon friend the member for crawley in introduce this bill today the right hon member for warley john spellar do not refer to that except to say that that amendment be in the propose legislation and that it show how we have pass bill to the other place as result of consensus that be one interpretation of what happen on that friday when we be debate amendment on report essentially what happen as you may recall madam deputy speaker be that there be large number of amendment and deal be do whereby two of those amendment be accept and all the other be reject one new clause about set up an advisory board on hunt trophy be now in the bill and wish to speak briefly about the importance of that and the background to it who will decide on issue relate to hunt trophy think we should have expertise rather than people who be prejudiced clause state the secretary of state must appoint an advisory board on hunt trophy the advisory board the advisory board appoint under subsection may have up to three member the role of the advisory board be to advise the secretary of state on any question relate to this act which the secretary of state may refer to the committee on any matter relate to the import to great britain of hunt trophy derive from specie of animal which appear to the secretary of state to be or to be likely to become endanger that be an improvement on the original bill because it would require the secretary of state to take advice instead of just listen to the mob so to speak and be pleased that that measure be in the bill clause state in appoint member of the advisory board the secretary of state must have regard to their expertise in matter relate to the import of hunt trophy one thing we discuss previously which do not think we have discuss today be the extent of the bill the bill extend to england wales scotland and northern ireland but the prohibition on import apply only to import into great britain why be that and why do the right hon gentleman in limit the bill to import into great britain think that that will help meet his objective do it not show that we be no long one nation of the united kingdom but that there will be different regime in northern ireland compare with the one that prevail in the rest of our country hope the minister will be able to explain why if the government be in favour of the bill and if they purport to be government for the whole united kingdom rather than just great britain they be propose to restrict the import of hunt trophy into great britain and not into northern ireland perhaps it have something to do with the fact that there be an open border between northern ireland and ireland and that ireland be in the european union which have much more benevolent approach to the import of hunt trophy than this government seem to have that important issue need to be address in the bill and hope that if it go into committee we can ensure that its provision apply equally to all part of the united kingdom there be no need to speak at great length on something like this when the argument against the bill be so strong but we should not vilify those people who engage in conservation measure in the way that some have be seek to do the proof of the pudding be in the eating if we compare kenya with other country in southern africa we see that kenya well intend ban have be totally counterproductive whereas in southern africa there have be tremendous progress on the conservation of endanger specie on lateral point be the collection of rare and endangered butterfly specie illegal in this country no with very few exception if we be free to pin butterfly to the wall or put they in display cabinet do it suit we to preach to people in africa about their conservation measure think not we talk about the importance of cull which be essential to control the number of species in the restricted area of wildlife park we cull in this country particularly deer that culling can include the use of rifle to shoot the deer that people think have the fine antler those antler be keep as trophy that be not my line of business at all but respect that other people might like to do that it be all part of cull to ensure that we do not have too many deer to manage this complex bill be worthy of far detailed consideration but be worried that the government may have secret agenda they may try to use the parliament act on this legislation would be grateful if my hon friend the minister could assure that under no circumstance will the government seek to override the parliament of this united kingdom by seek to use the parliament act on bill that be reject in the other house not because it be vote down but because not enough time be give for it be not sure that there be any precedent for the parliament act be use when debate in the other place have be curtail through lack of time the bill have be bring back in the next session and the government failure to provide time be use as justification for use the parliament act would be grateful if the minister could respond to that point when she wind up the debate finally let put on record that be against this bill have second reading in its present form hopefully will have the opportunity to vote that way later call the shadow minister be pleased to speak on this important bill the importation to the uk of trophy produce during the barbaric sport of trophy hunting should have end long time ago thank my right hon friend the member for warley john spellar for introduce the bill follow the early bill from the hon member for crawley henry smith we need to get this sorted today because we have have warley and crawley and be not sure there be another constituency that rhyme thank animal welfare charity nationwide include four paw humane society international world animal protection and ban trophy hunting they have work tirelessly for year to ensure that this legislation be pass and have produce the most helpful briefing note for this debate also pay tribute to the former president of botswana ian khama who have be tireless and passionate campaigner on these issue however for all the praise that our campaigner be due we should not have need to be here debate this bill today the legislation should have be pass by this government long ago we all know that member of the public include in my constituency overwhelmingly support the bill the wide public support for it be reflect in the fact that ban hunt trophy be both conservative manifesto promise as the hon member for crawley say and labour manifesto promise why be this measure promise by the government not already in law why do they fail to bring forward their own bill ban trophy hunting as they pledge to voter that they would give that an early private member bill seek to implement ban progress through the house last year why be we here again debate an equivalent bill it be because the bill we debate last year be deliberately and wholly undemocratically derail by small number of mostly hereditary conservative peer as my hon friend the member for eltham clive efford point out those peer ignore the will of the public the welfare of animal and their own party manifesto commitment and use the amendment process as block device labour member think that that be unacceptable and our party want this long promise and long overdue legislation progress as soon as possible when that bill reach the house of lords no peer step forward to sponsor it why do no labour peer do so thank the hon gentleman for point that out obviously there be issue go on in the other place that be not party to at the time so be sorry but can not comment on his point the hon lady keep refer disparagingly to hereditary peer but be it not correct to say that significant proportion of hereditary peer be elect to that house unlike most of the other peer who be appointee thank the hon gentleman for that he say that keep refer to hereditary peer but have refer to they once in response to one of my colleague it be fascinating that some conservative members want to defend not only this completely outdated and barbaric practice of trophy hunting but the procedure by which few hereditary peer be elect among themselves no member of the public have any say in the matter may help my hon friend by say that in the previous session the bill be introduce by conservative member indeed conservative member of the house of lords be go to take up that bill but someone else shoot in and grab it beforehand with bit of sleight of hand if the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope want to defend that sort of jiggery pokery he be welcome to order be anxious for we to come back to the bill before we as oppose to discuss bill that we might deal with later today about hereditary peer thank you for clarify that madam deputy speaker thank my right hon friend the member for warley for set out what happen in the lords but will move on the bill will prevent people from bring into great britain hunt trophy from the specie list in annex which be the most endangered specie or annex which be specie threaten by commercial trade of the principal wildlife trade regulation those list largely correspond to equivalent in cite which be an important international agreement protect endangered plant and animal and the uk be party to it the bill also create an advisory board on hunt trophy as some conservative members highlight which will advise the secretary of state on any issue relate to the legislation or any matter relate to the import to great britain of hunt trophy derive from specie that be or be likely to become endanger can not emphasise enough how crucial this legislation be trophy hunting be not only barbaric but wholly unnecessary in this country as in most other we have long recognise that animal should not be subject to unnecessary suffering that principle be reflect domestically in our animal welfare act and align with our understanding support by animal welfare science and enshrine in legislation that animal be sentient being as such they deserve to be treat with dignity and humanity there be nothing dignified or humane about the sport of trophy hunting it involve kill innocent animal for the sole purpose of turn their body into trophy the animal often experience immense pain fear and distress in the moment before they die some may be shoot by inexperienced hunter use less efficient weapon such as crossbow or spear which do not deliver rapid death we see this with cecil the lion in who suffer for several hour follow his wounding by crossbow in beautiful part of southern africa before he be finally put out of his misery his death quite rightly cause outrage around the world include here in britain other practice that trophy hunting can involve raise further welfare concern be horrify to learn of the practice of canned hunting the captive wildlife farming of animal for hunting it often involve inflict extremely poor welfare condition on the captive wild animal mostly lion who may have to suffer from unsatisfactory enclosure lack of enrichment and insufficient provision of shelter and vet treatment all so that part of their body may eventually become somebody trophy let we not forget the negative impact that trophy hunting can have on other animal such as the harm to offspring who may be unable to survive on their own after their parent be leave for dead that be highlight early as be the weakening of the gene pool these be important factor to consider trophy hunting can have negative impact on wildlife trophy hunter tend to target the world most iconic animal include endangered wild animal specie such as lion polar bear giraffe and rhino hunter selfishly kill these vulnerable animal so that they can display their body part as some sort of perverse prize world animal protection note that british hunter have bring home approximately hunt trophy since the and approximately of these come from specie at risk of extinction the public be right to find this absolutely abhorrent and to want to increase the protection afford to these specie which be already under pressure from habitat loss climate change poach and the illegal wildlife trade by pass this important legislation my hon friend the member for canterbury rosie duffield eloquently outline those issue early let we not forget how unnecessary these horror be compare with the overall revenue that local economy gain from tourism income from trophy hunting be insignificant report by economist at large that analyse eight african country find that while overall tourism be between and of gdp in the eight country the total economic contribution of trophy hunter be at most about of gdp in stark contrast to the claim make by some conservative members there be more ethical and sustainable alternative to trophy hunting for conservation recent study show that of previous or potential tourist to south africa include those visit from within africa would be willing to pay daily lion protection fee for wildlife conservation photographic safaris which as the born free foundation put it involve shoot an animal with camera not gun be another welfare friendly alternative to hunt trophy these alternative activity have the potential to generate income equalling or even exceed the income generate from trophy hunting without cause pain and suffering to wild animal my hon friend the member for eltham highlight that when he mention the amazing experience he have on his photographic safari support global effort to promote humane tourism be consistent with recent legislation pass in this house namely the animals low welfare activities abroad act however note that the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs be yet to even consult on the activate regulation that be necessary for the act to have any impact or to give any indication of when such consultation will begin encourage he to do so as matter of urgency because wild animal deserve protection and that require regulatory action on this and so many animal welfare issue the government be let animal and the public down by fail to act as the shadow secretary of state my hon friend the member for croydon north steve reed point out last friday when another private member bill contain broken conservative party promise be before the house the government have completely abandon an extraordinary number of the animal welfare pledge they have make the government like to tell the public that they have progress world lead animal welfare commitment but compassion in world farming rank the uk only ninth among european country by percentage of cage free farm animal trail luxembourg austria sweden the netherlands germany slovenia denmark and belgium although the government have announce their support for private member bills on animal welfare issue put forward by their back bench mps since they abandon the animal welfare kept animals bill that be not leadership gently say to the minister that if the government really care about animal and wish to honour the enormous public interest in pass strong law for animal they would put forward their own promise measure until they do so labour will keep remind the government of their broken promise and put forward private member bill like this one which we hope will become law as soon as possible we have see in the house today near unanimous show of support this be not racist colonial legislation it be uk law govern what come into the uk that be our right and the bill seek to exercise that so let get on with it and get it do many member on both side of the house have be eagerly await the passing of this piece of legislation as have many outside campaigner who have work tirelessly on the issue and many of our constituent have have many email on the issue in taunton deane thank the right hon member for warley john spellar for introduce the bill and all those who have take part in the debate not least my hon friend the member for crawley henry smith who do such sterling job just one year ago think he will agree that we have lively debate then and we have have similarly lively debate today want to list some of the colleague from both side of the house who have speak eloquently my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton make the point well about take photograph of these wonderful creature there be intervention by my right hon friend the members for chipping barnet theresa villiers and for suffolk coastal dr coffey and my hon friend the member for watford dean russell but there have also be move speech in particular from my hon friend the member for crawley of course many opposition speaker have join in as well it be clear that the issue of hunt trophy continue to divide opinion we have witness some of that today from my hon friend the members for christchurch sir christopher chope and for north herefordshire sir bill wiggin there be disagreement over the scientific social economic moral and ethical rationale for trophy hunting and that will no doubt continue for some time there be those who point to evidence of the potential benefit of well manage hunting we hear great deal about that from my hon friend the member for north herefordshire we also hear the other side of the argument with evidence of the harm cause by poor practice want to stress something critical we face the triple planetary crisis of biodiversity loss climate change and pollution those be the great threat we face globally and as the nature minister they be in my inbox every day be only too aware of all those threat and of how we need to tackle they about million animal and plant specie face extinction much of that have occur very recently in our lifetime the abundance diversity and connectivity of specie be decline fast than at any time in human history and that include the specie target for trophy hunting we all know and love they elephant rhino lion leopard and polar bear to name just handful there be those who argue that ban the import of trophy from those animal will do nothing to improve their conservation status and be certainly listen to my hon friend on that but we have to ask ourselves whether import into great britain trophy from endangered animal help to tackle biodiversity loss do this trade really help to secure sustainable future for specie on the brink of extinction many animal be under terrible threat anyway because their habitat be shrink that be happen for range of social and economic reason but climate change be certainly part of it ultimately the aim of the bill be to ensure that import of hunt trophy to great britain do not put additional pressure on already threaten specie that be what should concentrate our mind and that be why be pleased to confirm that the government will support the bill in do so we signal our continue determination to fulfil our manifesto commitment in this regard have hear the argument that ban will have implication for local community and conservation effort globally which be definitely something we must consider carefully we must be alive to the unintended consequence however the bill be about import into great britain as many have say in the debate my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal remind we of that this be about listen to the british public there be clear strong and consistent message that we need to bring to an end the import of endanger animal take as hunt trophy the wind of change be blow we in that direction and number of country have already put restriction in place will my hon friend give way be not go to take any intervention because member have make so many already and we do not want to restrict the debate on the ultra low emission zone but will refer to some of the point that my hon friend rightly raise in moment it be important to recognise that the import ban will not prevent uk resident or citizen from participate in hunting while they be overseas trophy hunting can and will continue around the world it be right that each country should be able to decide how good to manage its own wildlife and the bill do not change that that point be highlight vociferously by my hon friend the members for christchurch and for north herefordshire but it have to be remember that we be not prevent that country around the world on both side of the debate have have regular opportunity to discuss this issue and raise their point indeed we have have letter from the president of botswana and namibia the high commissioner be write to just yesterday it be important to keep in mind the contribution that the uk trade in hunt trophy make annual import of hunt trophy to the uk be very few in number on average there have be year over the last year even so it be essential that we play our part to ensure that community around the world benefit from conserve the wildlife that they live alongside that be reflect in the agreement of the hugely important global biodiversity framework there be now strong and essential focus on how as global community we finance biodiversity conservation and restoration work member will be aware of just how much the government be do on that front with our huge million darwin initiative and our million darwin plus initiative all of that focus on biodiversity and conservation work with local and indigenous people penultimately let run through some of the provision in the bill the bill will ban the import of hunt trophy from specific specie with the explicit aim of ensure that import into great britain do not place unnecessary pressure on specie that be at risk for those specie an import ban without exemption will be the most effective protection as it will provide clarity and address the conservation concern arise from trophy hunting clause and make provision for the import ban which will cover trophy bring into great britain from animal hunt after the legislation come into force there be strict clear line about anything that happen before that the definition of hunting trophy in clause be the body of an animal or readily recognisable part or derivative of an animal that be obtain through hunting for the hunter personal use that be how hunt trophy be define in our current control under cite clause apply the import ban to all specie list in annex and of the wildlife trade regulation the wildlife trade regulation implement the convention on international trade in endanger specie cite in great britain annex and be broadly equivalent to appendice and ii of the convention and include specie that the global community have agree to protect through trade restriction due to their conservation status they cover great number of specie threaten by international trade such as big cat all bear all primate hippos rhino and elephant as result the bill will end the permit system for import of hunt trophy derive from those specie there will be no provision for exemption to the import ban clause be about movement from northern ireland the clause state clearly that the import ban will not apply in relation to the removal of qualify northern ireland good from northern ireland to great britain clause which be mention by my hon friend the member for christchurch establish an advisory board on hunt trophy the clause state the role of the advisory board be to advise the secretary of state on any question relate to this act clause simply cover the bill extent application commencement and short title let quickly discuss the impact assessment as do not allow any intervention we hear some view about the impact assessment and what the government will do about it but there be two side to that the impact assessment present both side of the debate but it also highlight that trophy hunting can lead to population decline and that over hunting threaten more than of endanger mammal specie accord to the international union for conservation of nature the impact assessment also note that trophy hunt quota be inappropriate unscientific excessive and over reliant on opinion and that the management of such quota be base on poor quality datum similarly report by the university of oxford find that the damaging effect of the unsustainable trade in hunting can extend beyond hunt area hope that have answer some of the question this have be very positive and lively debate on both side of the house thank the right hon member for warley for bring the bill back to the house and reconfirm that the government be fully commit to support it with the leave of the house call john spellar to wind up object in that case will put the question question put that the bill be now read second time the house

bill wiggin christopher chope the house have divide ayes noes question accordingly agree to bill read second time to stand committed to public bill committee standing order no greater london low emission zone charging amendment bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time the bill would overturn the expansion of the ulez scheme simply because it be cruel cruel form of taxation it be particularly cruel to the poor in society hit heavily those people who have old motor vehicle that they can not afford to upgrade with or without scrappage scheme it be also very unfair on business owner especially those in outer london who lose out on business that they would otherwise have secure from people travel in from neighbouring county to purchase their good and on people who live outside london who have no say in who the london mayor be the border between london and the home county be not neat people in my constituency live in kent but some of they have to go into london just to exit their road the border straddle some road it be border that can not be avoid and the mayor of london know that my hon friend and parliamentary neighbour be make an impressive start he and share road in crayford and dartford where people live on different side of the road pay different taxis some people such as gardener and plumber travel regularly from dartford to bexleyheath and crayford for work and they can not afford this it be so unfair especially as it be not in the mayor manifesto when he be last elect that be an absolutely valid point but would go far about of police officer in the metropolitan police area live outside london and commute in and the percentage for all emergency worker be probably about the same these be the people who londoner rely on the most they be vital to londoners but if their vehicle be not ulez compliant they be hit with every single time they go to work even bad those do night shift have to pay on the way in and on the way out again because at am there might be no public transport for emergency worker to be hit with just for do night shift be totally and utterly wrong my hon friend be make great speech as he know he have my full support do he agree that today we will see whose side labour member be on be they go to talk the bill out or be they go to back those emergency service worker and other in bexley who want to be rid of ulez pay tribute to my hon friend for the work that he have do in this respect he be entirely right we will see today whether labour member be in favour of the worker or in favour of sadiq khan be follow the hon gentleman argument with interest in bristol we have experience the first year of clean air zone which be actually impose on we as requirement by the then secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey because the government have be take to court by clientearth for be in breach of air pollution limit and therefore insist that we should adopt the scheme in bristol if have chance to speak later will comment on how successful it be but in any case that seem slightly at odd with the hon gentleman argument about local autonomy be grateful for that intervention because it give an opportunity to smash the myth that the expansion of the ulez scheme have anything whatsoever to do with air pollution if it be about air pollution the mayor of london would ban motor vehicle from go into london but he do not want to ban they he want to make money out of they if those motorist give the mayor they can drive all day long in london he do not give damn take my constituency in dartford for example many people who previously use the blackwall tunnel with ulez non compliant vehicle be now have to use the dartford crossing to get across the thames it be add to pollution in area such as dartford not remove it do my hon friend remember the letter write in which be sign by many member present today include himself sadiq khan the mayor of london want to put charge border tax as call it on people drive into london which have nothing to do with the environment at that time he fail to do so after pressure be put on little bit later shock horror he put the same thing out but with an environmental tinge to it it be greenwashe and it be make people in place such as watford who work so hard pay extra just to go to work my hon friend be absolutely right and pay tribute to the work he have do on this issue for some time the approach to the border tax as he call it highlight the fact that the mayor of london be hellbent on bring in system whereby he could make money out of car originally he want to make money out of every car when he be stop from do that he decide to make money out of certain car only that be his plan my constituent be equally adversely affect and would benefit from my hon friend bill can he answer the question of why the government themselves do not use the power available to they to ban this extension of ulez be grateful to my hon friend for intervene as the law stand at the moment the government do not have the power to overturn the ulez expansion as consequence have introduce this bill which would give the government the power to overturn the expansion be really grateful to the minister for his work and effort on this issue and for the fact that the government now support the bill therefore hope that it will be successful we have hear about the scrappage scheme but if we actually look into it we see that it be up to per vehicle good luck get vehicle that be ulez compliant for up to we be also hear that people be find it very difficult to actually get their or up to from transport for london there have be lot of delay people have say why do we expand the scrappage scheme right down to dartford and beyond well where do we draw the line if we be go to increase the scrappage area should it go up to the midland or down to the west country it could cost the taxpayer of this country billion of pound simply because the mayor of london be unable to organise his finance strongly support my hon friend bill because this be an unjust charge do he agree that some of the victim of the charge be local high street business in outer london whose customer from beyond the london border be reluctant to come in because they may have to pay the charge pay tribute to my right hon friend who have be real champion of this issue for her constituent in barnet she be absolutely right people outside of london like to travel into london to use the dry cleaner fish and chip shop sweet shop and so on but that no long happen if their vehicle be not ulez compliant have be listen to the hon gentleman very carefully he keep talk about money making as if someone be make profit but that money go to london service he be dartford mp from outside of london how do he suggest that my constituent in london who be write to in large number about the state of the pothole on our road can afford to pay for his constituent to drive through place such as my constituency on their way to the blackwall tunnel he be try to deny londoners the right to have decent road be rather surprised that the hon member be stand up in support of what the mayor of london have do with the ulez scheme think that if he look at his inbox carefully he would see that most of his constituent particularly the poor in his constituency do not like the fact that they be have to pay just to use their motor vehicle do not feel that this be something on which his constituent support he be bit concerned that the hon gentleman have be look into my email think will have word with the parliamentary estate manager about that perhaps the reason be stand up today be that not too many people have contact about ulez since it have be introduce what they be contact about be the state of our road the pothole on our road be symbolic of the conservatives disastrous management of our public service over the past year and everyone be complain about they maybe the hon member have an oasis in south london where everyone around the outside hat the ulez scheme but in eltham they love it but would be very surprised gently remind he that most of the road in eltham be maintain by greenwich labour council which should take its share of responsibility for the state of the road my hon friend the member for watford dean russell mention the border charge the mayor launch consultation that show that people reject the expansion it be absolutely clear they do not want it there be question mark over how that consultation be handle but it be clear that the majority of people do not want the expansion yet the mayor still go ahead with it when he stand to be mayor his manifesto do not mention the fact that he want to expand the ulez scheme right to the border so he have no mandate from his manifesto his transport plan have no mention of the expansion either so the mayor of london do not have mandate for expand the ulez scheme have hear people say well this be interfere with devolution it be undermine devolution interruption would say the opposite it be the action of the london mayor that be undermine devolution the whole point of devolution be to bequeath the power to make law to mayors in this example and for those elect mayor to use the power for the people they represent it be not devolution when those power have profound impact on people who do not come from the area that mayor represent the mayor of london action have have huge impact on the life of people live in dartford who do not have the power to vote he in or out it be taxation without representation or any kind of accountability whatsoever frankly it be devolution at its bad which be why it be right that central government intervene over this matter devolve power be be take way beyond intended and they be impact people who be not able to vote in that area predict that this be the beginning not the end if sadiq khan win the election for london mayor in may as sure as night follow day he will change the criterion for vehicle to be ulez compliant until we get to the stage where every single petrol or diesel car be impact by the expansion people watch this debate at home if they have nothing well to do on friday afternoon may be sit pretty think this do not affect because my car be ulez compliant it have nothing to do with say they should be very aware of what happen at the mayoral election as sure as night follow day the mayor of london will change the goal post and ensure that all motor vehicle will be hit by the ulez expansion on that point do my hon friend agree that it be clear that what the mayor of london say and what he do be very different he previously rule out expand ulez and then he do it my hon friend be absolutely right that be typical of what have happen throughout the debate about ulez in july last year the leader of the labour party say that ulez expansion be wonderful thing come the by election in uxbridge and south ruislip he say oh no we have get to think again over this one not quite sure if we get this one right just this week he say the ulez expansion be great thing we have have enormous dithering from the leader of the labour party over this issue and the mayor of london be take full advantage of that fact on that point will the hon gentleman give way will not we have westminster hall debate at which many colleague be present unfortunately not single labour back bencher turn up it be pitiful and it highlight the labour party mismanagement of the issue we have the mayoral election come up in may and the conservative candidate susan hall have pledge to overturn the ulez expansion on day one the quick and most effective way to overturn the ulez expansion be therefore to vote for susan hall if we do that or if my bill be successful we will end cruel tax on many people who have no say on london mayor it be an attack on the poor in society and those who can least afford to pay be be hit the hard can not wait to see the back of it rise to speak in opposition to the bill for three key reason first it represent an attack on devolution secondly it ignore the urgent and important need to tackle poor air quality not just here in london but in town and city across our country we would be forgive for forget about this urgent public health issue because the hon member for dartford gareth johnson barely mention it in his introduction yet it go to the very heart of have the ultra low emission zone it be about try to tackle something that be significant problem here in london and in town and city across the country and it be not just problem in city centre the heat map for my city show that poor air quality be not restrict to the city centre and that the ring road have particular issue poor air quality be an issue in outer london just as it be in inner london thirdly the bill use serious public health issue for purely party political point scoring begin with devolution interruption it would be nice if could hear myself speak it be worth remember that the ultra low emission zone and indeed emission charge zone be tory policy that be push on to local government by tory government and first champion here in london by tory mayor we would not know that from listen to the intervention of conservative members the mayor of london have statutory obligation in relation to air quality across the greater london area he have right indeed duty to introduce measure to meet the national air quality target set by central government the whole purpose of devolution be for local people to determine the policy that be need for their area the government have set the target for air quality and it be for democratically elect mayors and local authority to run their city or county in way that work well for their area which know can be controversial my city be unique in this country in have workplace parking levy would not say for one moment that it have not be controversial it be incredibly controversial when it be first introduce more than year ago when under previous conservative lead government there be huge problem with austerity people be feel the impact of that austerity so the levy introduction be delay by year but it be about both discourage people from drive into the city and provide an income stream that could be use to improve alternative to drive by invest in public transport it have be incredibly successful nottingham be one of the city that have not be force to introduce clean air zone because its work to improve public transport in part fund by the workplace parking levy have lead to that situation the mayor of london expand the ulez in august because toxic air pollution be public health crisis he be act to tackle the crisis of poor air quality remind hon member that poor air quality be link to around premature death per year in london it lead to child grow up with stunt lung and contribute to people develop serious health problem include asthma heart disease and dementia understand that the hon member for dartford might not agree with the mayor about the good way to tackle air pollution but that be democracy my hon friend be develop powerful argument and this be what the conservatives have no answer to what would they put in place to deal with the health aspect of poor air quality such as damage to child development and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory and coronary illness who be adversely affect by this issue the conservatives be desperate because they have nothing to offer the people of london they seek to scaremonger about this charge there be no concern whatsoever for the health of londoners or those people in outer london who be suffer most from air pollution my hon friend be absolutely right it be really tell when the hon member for dartford begin to talk about his mayoral candidate that he say nothing about her plan to tackle the serious issue of air pollution my hon friend hit on blunter truth about the bill in six week time our constituent whether they agree or not with the argument make by the hon member for dartford or with argument on the importance of tackle air pollution will have the opportunity to express an opinion at the ballot box when choose who the london mayor oversee this policy should be be the message of the bill that conservative mp have no confidence in their mayoral candidate win that argument or indeed do anything in support of their policy they clearly feel the need to intervene and usurp devolution so should nobody in london even bother with the conservative campaign because their candidate own colleague think she be incompetent my hon friend have hit the nail on the head progress be be achieve the vast majority of car out of in greater london be compliant with ulez labour member be pleased that transport for london and the mayor of london have decide to expand the scrappage scheme to support those who be struggle as result of the tory cost of living crisis be listen with interest to the hon lady speech the government obviously support the bill in the circumstance apply will she address the point that be fairly make about people outside mayoral zone be affect and penalise by enter mayoral zone when they do not vote for that unusual as it be for the minister to intervene think the point be make by my hon friend the member for eltham clive efford when people from outside london drive into london the cost of that in term of health and wear and tear on the road be bear by constituent here in london it be not unreasonable for they to expect that those who benefit from everything that london have to offer who travel into the centre cause congestion and poor air quality should abide by the well establish principle that the polluter pay this go back to what be say about the fact that the government insist that bristol have clean air zone obviously that will have significant impact on people from bath for example who drive down the into my constituency cause huge amount of congestion and air pollution but that be basically how politic work entirely agree with what my hon friend just say the duty of politician be to look after people in the patch they represent my hon friend be exactly right will come on to address how we well tackle the issue of air pollution and at the same time protect those who be impact by this charge from august last year every londoner with non compliant vehicle become eligible for grant to assist they in replace their vehicle understand why people have say that be not enough but that have be provide despite central government give no financial support to the mayor of london for it of course if the government be concerned about the if they be concerned about the impact of their clean air charging zone they could have provide additional assistance will the hon lady give way no be not give way at the moment as be say the government could have provide additional financial support to the mayor of london so that that grant could have be increase but they choose not to so be proud that labour be the party of devolution interruption it be labour that create the mayoral model in london and create the scottish parliament the welsh assembly and the northern ireland assembly as well as always have order the hon lady be try to make speech we have conversation go on between the two front bench team and rather lot of shout at the hon lady herself we need to listen to her speech with respect as be say that devolution be as well as always have regional and local decision making and funding across england be pleased that the next labour government will build on that record indeed labour mayors across england be already show how it be do whether that be in manchester liverpool south yorkshire or west yorkshire take back control of bus support new home and reform employment and skill be very much look forward to see claire ward elect as the first mayor of the east midlands on may sadly while labour be committed to more devolution this bill show that the tories be simply try to roll it back wish to say little more about air pollution which be at the heart of this bill and the strategy to tackle it as have already say we know the problem that poor air cause it affect our health and our environment as many as people die prematurely each year as result of poor air quality the elderly the unwell and the economically deprived be those most likely to be affect the government own estimate say that poor air quality cost the uk economy billion of pound each year think about my own constituency and the argument that we have about the workplace parking levy lot of people in the city do not pay the levy because they simply can not afford to run car at all they be reliant on public transport we also know where the problem occur key pollutant include nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter know as be find in many place and too many air quality zone in the uk exceed legal limit the world health organisation tell we that there be no safe level of exposure to fine particulate matter we know what cause poor air quality it come from several source industry agriculture home business and yes transport road transport be responsible for the vast majority of nitrogen oxide concentration at place in the uk that exceed the legal limit with diesel engine significant contributor the number of car and van on our road continue to rise and congestion have worsen which increase pollution in itself transport also generate significant proportion of particulate matter which can come from both combustion and wear of tyre and brake pad clean vehicle help to solve the problem and we have make some progress on that but not enough there be example from across the country of the action that can be take to tackle emission low emission zone be only one tool in the toolbox and it could be say that they should be last resort as have say in my city there have be considerable investment in public transport pay for in part by proceed from the workplace parking levy we have have major extension to our tram network nottingham municipal bus company introduce new biogas bus year ago and be really pleased to see that it have just start to roll out new electric vehicle do not deny that there have be support from central government for some of that investment for some year the city council have have an anti idle campaign that multi pronged approach mirror similar action in town and city across the uk with not one but multiple tool be use to tackle this serious public health issue the department for transport have support the development of low emission bus and taxi that be good thing because tackle poor air quality should be about central government work with local council and mayors rather than dictate to they as the bill do central government should support and collaborate with they in prepare for the debate go back to report produce by four cross party select committees that look at improve air quality one thing that the committees come together to recommend be collaboration and partnership between central government local authority and mayors because air pollution be problem that can not be fix by central or local government alone they need to work together like the mayor of london local authority be already responsible for meet air quality target but they find it difficult to make change partly due to lack of resource and partly because the change need be politically unpalatable guess that in part be what have cause the debate it be while ago but that joint report from call for ambitious co ordinate cross departmental action be sorry that in some respect the government have fail on that as they have prevaricate on remove the most polluting vehicle from our road at the time of the report we call on they to have more ambitious target for the removal of petrol and diesel car think they be only commit to remove they by they do at first commit to more ambitious target of end the sale of petrol and diesel car but more recently they have row back from that which make it more difficult for we to achieve the improvement that we know be need there be also decision to row back on the electrifi cation of our railway in favour of bi mode train which have worry implication for air quality carbon emission and noise every time go to st pancras station to catch my train home to nottingham stand on the platform among diesel train because the railway be not electrify all the way to nottingham frankly be look forward to see new train on the midland main line next year but they will be bi mode train and while they will leave st pancras under electric power which will improve air quality in central london by the time they get to nottingham they will be operate under diesel power do far less to improve air quality in our city that be the result of decade of broken promise from successive tory prime ministers who have pause and cancel the electrification of the midland mainline we now know that electric train will not reach nottingham until at least the early have sometimes joke that will be retire by the time we get there and be afraid that might be the case there be danger of the government rely too heavily on new technology to solve our air quality challenge and place too much emphasis on clean up road vehicle and not enough on reduce the number of vehicle on our road improve public transport and encourage active travel should lie at the heart of any clean air strategy get freight off our road and on to our railway would be welcome take many heavy good vehicle which be often the most polluting off our road back in the four select committees conclude that the department for environment food and rural affairs and the department for transport should work closely with local authority to ensure that council introduce clean air zone receive the support that they need to implement complementary measure that encourage car driver to switch to public transport and active travel and increase the take up of electric vehicle understand that not every journey can be make by public transport or bicycle or on foot but if we can change proportion of those journey we can make real difference for while the conservative party seem really interested in walk and cycling see the minister with responsibility for walk and cycling the hon member for hexham guy opperman sit on the front bench but he have not be terribly busy yesterday at transport question not single conservative mp ask question about active travel it be disappointing that they have scale back their investment in that investment in low emission bus be great but the value of that investment be magnify if local authority also take step to encourage motorist to opt for bus rather than make journey by car understand the argument make by the hon member for dartford that people can continue to drive but of course charge be disincentive that be partly how the scheme operate the pandemic have huge impact on public transport usage both in london and across the country pay tribute to the government for their bus fare which have be welcome initiative in london the labour mayor sadiq khan have also take action both to protect londoner from the tory cost of live crisis and to encourage more people to travel by public transport he have introduce the hopper fare on bus and have freeze fare in five out of eight year without action or modal shift effort to tackle congestion or improve air quality be less likely to succeed many of the policy need to tackle urban congestion could also help to improve air quality tackle both issue could have positive effect on both the local and the national economy significant increase in active travel could make difference not just to air quality policy but to tackle obesity improve mental health and build well community my hon friend be make an incredibly powerful case for why air quality should be priority for we all ultimately it be social justice issue however rich or poor we be we all breathe the same air suggest to anyone who live in london that they will see the need to tackle low air quality if they leave london for couple of day and then blow their nose they will realise what they have be breathe in this issue affect everyone she be right that we must tackle it nationally as well as locally do she agree that unless the conservatives come up with an alternative plan they be condemn the poor in our community to the bad health outcome my hon friend make an important point would be surprised if many people decide that they want to go in the direction of have conservative mayor in the absence of proper information about how conservative mayor would tackle air pollution finally this bill be about party political point scoring the government support clean air zone indeed they provide cash for scrappage scheme in bristol bath sheffield birmingham portsmouth and other area of the country but not london wonder why in town and city across england not just in london our constituent have face year of tory economic failure they can not afford another week let alone more month or heaven forbid year of tory government family be sick with anxiety as they endure this cost of living crisis while their local service be under immense pressure when time be tough due to the conservatives economic failure it be essential that we look at option for achieve clean air without disproportionately impact people we must secure our economy and make it strong by get growth back on course as the last labour government do whereas we have have an anaemic situation under year of the tories interruption they do not want to hear it do they they do not want to hear that growth be fast under labour government than under year of the tories fourteen year of tory economic failure have leave we in this position where everything be bad and everything be break it be by grow our economy that we will provide sustainable long term funding for council and give local area the tool and stability that they need for growth as we push power wealth and opportunity out from westminster the hon lady have be speak for nearly half an hour and it be obvious that she and the labour party wish to talk out my bill to overturn the expansion of the ulez scheme can ask what her message be to lady speak to recently in my constituency she say that she could not visit her sister in bexley just few mile away as she be disabled person she could not use public transport could not afford to upgrade her car and could not afford taxi that may not affect people in nottingham south but it do affect people in dartford understand that people face cost of living crisis what the hon member should have explain to that lady be why she feel so much bad off after year of conservative government he should not try to pin it on single issue it be down to his government failure and he should take some responsibility for that thank my hon friend for her excellent speech in support of clean air which be what this debate be all about what would she say to the many parent meet in my constituency who introduce to child who have asthma on scale never see before through ulez and other measure they will see their child health improve my hon friend make an important point that could be lose in this debate which be that the issue be about health the health of child and old people it be as my hon friend the member for walthamstow stella creasy say about the health of some of the poor in society they be most impact by poor air quality that be what we should be talk about if as the promoter of the bill the hon member for dartford gareth johnson claim the issue be not health why be the government support charge zone in other city we will have to listen to the minister answer on that however it be clear that the government want clean air charge zone in fact they be requirement on city that have not succeed in meet air quality target through other measure be not go to apologise for speak in this debate because as say have long have an interest in air quality the experience in my city mean we have something to offer and share finally let turn to the alternative because the hon member for dartford do not say much about alternative want to talk about that because labour do have plan to support driver we will support they by focus on the cost of live and on the infrastructure challenge which be real priority for household that have and use car that probably include most of we some of the time even if we walk cycle or use bus most of the time our plan include work with the competition and markets authority the financial conduct authority and industry on address the soar cost of car insurance we plan to bring railway back into public hand and to allow all local authority to take back control of their bus service london never have to put up with the deregulation of its bus service as the rest of the country do those thing have the capability to relieve congestion by improve the state of our public transport network and imagine other local authority might like to follow nottingham lead by have municipal bus company which once again have be show to provide one of the good bus service in the entire country would say that we have the good bus service thank to nottingham city transport labour government would be commit to protect our environment help to decarbonise the economy and ensure that we all have safe air to breathe labour would work with local authority and mayoral combine authority to support they to meet air quality target in the way that work well for their area we appreciate that emission level in different area vary as result of the kind of industry and economic activity in those area and we will work in partnership with local and regional government empower they to protect and improve air quality while foster economic innovation and productivity labour would make it clear that the government have direct responsibility to work with our local authority to avoid the need for charge clean air zone through the adoption of alternative air quality improvement method such as those have talk about re rout traffic land management speed limit well public transport and well option to get freight off our road and on to our railway that responsibility should also extend to help to mitigate the impact of any proposal that clear the strong threshold set by the government for clean air zone thank you mr deputy speaker for give the opportunity to speak in this debate and hope that hon member will focus on the issue of air pollution and the need to take action in variety of way to tackle it let begin by congratulate my neighbour my hon friend the member for dartford gareth johnson on his bill which be delighted to sponsor be delighted to participate in this debate and to congratulate he also on his excellent informative and constructive speech be rather disappointed in the hon member for nottingham south lilian greenwood for whom have lot of respect because she do not say much about ulez she take we on tour of nottingham and tell we about other part of labour party policy but she show total misunderstanding of or no understanding of outer london interruption she can barrack all she like but she never have view on outer london she also make statement that be fundamentally untrue in say that this government have not bail out the mayor of london transport for london have be bail out so many time in the past few year but she do not say that she gloss over the management of she also do not come up with any fact or figure to show that ulez have reduce the level of pollution in inner london we be still see huge level of pollution in inner london even on the underground which come to our attention last year rise the hon lady would not give way to so be certainly not go to give way to she have also not have the opportunity to start my speech know that opposition member just want to delay everybody and everything but want to speak for my borough of bexley we have long tour about nottingham but ulez affect my borough and my constituency not her in nottingham so think should have few minute to speak interruption the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy do not get up and ask to intervene but the other do the expansion of ulez affect my area and the surround area very badly it blindly copy the approach take in central and inner london without properly assess the implication for outer london or the neighbouring area the expansion have cause range of negative social financial and economic impact for those who can least afford it perhaps this be not the case for the hon member for eltham clive efford for whom have lot of respect but we be inundate with people in my borough some of whom support his party who think it be unfair for ulez to come to bexley when bexley have good air quality as do bromley be surprised at what he say have no doubt that it be correct as he as good friend of mine and an honourable man but do not believe that there have not be people in eltham who have say that this be unfair to those who be less well off be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give way want to clarify that do not say that have not have any people say that what say be that far more people write to about the state of our road which the government have cause by starve local authority of investment of course recently local authority have be give more money by the government would say to the hon member that that be the fault of greenwich council not the government my right hon friend rightly point out that the local council be responsible for the road what the hon member for eltham clive efford fail to point out be that the royal borough of greenwich have be give over million by the government through the recent announcement of the pothole fund be grateful to my hon friend and constituency neighbour the ulez extension be disastrous policy and another example of the london labour mayor fill the black hole in his finance this mayor be no friend of motorist we have already have mph speed limit bus lane and the congestion charge on people who need to use their car my constituent be very angry about this my borough be one of the two in london without the tube the dockland light railway or tram the mayor of london have never even look at extend any of those we only have southeastern rail and bus as our public transport it be all very well to say that we should go on the tube but we do not have it like many people we have to use car to get about in our area the lack of public transport and the fact that lot of what we have be unreliable have major implication for my constituent and resident of the borough of bexley we be heavily reliant on our car for various purpose we have one of the high car ownership rate and the low sustainable modal share rate in london over the last decade car and van registration have outstrip population growth these be not figure we want to have we hear all these wonderful thing that the mayor of london be do but in our area he have do very little make the point in an intervention on my hon friend the member for dartford that the mayor have no mandate for this extension it be all very well the hon member for nottingham south talk about mandate but from his last manifesto he have no mandate for this policy we could have debate it then the hon lady be high on the mandate but the manifesto do not mention it at all believe that the consultation be rather sham two third of people object to the ulez and they do so for many and various reason we have hear from business and we have hear my hon friend the member for dartford talk about his constituent who have to go and visit relative in bexley on regular basis and who now have to pay an extra every time the labour party say that it care about the less well off and those who be disadvantaged as do passionately believe in social mobility and in give people the chance to maximise their opportunity in life and have to say that the ulez be tax on those who can not afford to get around in bexley we do not have the public transport service that other london borough have the congestion charge have triple in the last few year and the fine for non payment have increase from to more than two day pay for minimum wage earner it be reduce to if pay within two week but that be still more than day pay this be very unsatisfactory for the less well off in the outer borough of london as well as for business key worker pensioner and family it be no good the labour party always blame somebody else because the ulez be introduce by the mayor of london the poor in my borough be the one who do not have the ability to change their car and give they to do so be bit of an insult be really disappointed thank the right hon gentleman for give way if he be to persuade the government to provide additional support for scrappage as they have do for other clean air zone in the country to people in the outer borough of london whom he and represent he would have my support but do he understand my concern our constituent can have their say on this matter at the london mayoral election in just six week time why be he seek to usurp his own candidate and her ability to address this issue do he have such little confidence that he feel that national legislation be need to undermine his own candidate or be it really sign that he think london recognise that the good option be sadiq khan have lot of respect for the hon lady and know her constituency very well grow up in woodford so know the area interruption know that be not in her constituency but my wife and son be bear in walthamstow the hon lady should let finish before she interject know that part of the world well and respect she tremendously for the work that she do locally what would say to she be that this be conversation that should have be have before the mayor implement the policy we could have then have meeting with the government and members represent outer london constituency and have discussion about how we could go forward constructively the mayor do not allow for that he just have an artificial consultation and do not take any notice of what people think and we do not have discussion we should have have it beforehand the hon lady say that these matter should be discuss with the government and other but we do not have that discussion this government have bail out the mayor of london so much which the opposition do not like to admit be big supporter of susan hall and very much hope that she will win on may it be important to note that lot of care worker have be in touch with some of they work in the constituency of the hon member for eltham and they be very cross that they have to pay it be more difficult to get night staff who have to pay surely that can not be right surely it must be look at again by the mayor of london because these be key worker in our area they do magnificent job and be always supportive of they will come to conclusion because do not want to take half an hour and not let other people participate in the debate be really disappointed that the opposition members who have speak so far have try to make this general discussion about clean air zone across the country we be look at london unfortunately we no long have the debate we always use to debate on london issue on thursday that be when we could discuss london issue not nottingham or national issue however important they might be and air quality be very important if we be go to do that as say to the hon member for nottingham south let we have the figure for the improvement in inner london and the pollution that be still on the tube after year of the charge be in place in the centre of london will the right hon member give way no be go to conclude because want other people to have chance if people take half an hour it be not fair on other who want to speak whatever they want to say thank my hon friend the minister who will respond to the debate and be particularly supportive of the secretary of state for transport who be do brilliant job in the department he announce today that the government will certainly be support this bill in conclusion because want other people to have the chance to speak the ulez extension be hurry in without proper discussion and consultation and without thought of the consequence and my constituent be suffer because of it as bristol mp suppose have to apologise for dare to take part in debate that be primarily about our capital city but million of our constituent visit as tourist and come here to work and as nation we all want to see it as healthy safe and pleasant place for people to visit and to live and work in regardless of which constituency we represent want to challenge the hon member for dartford gareth johnson who bring in the bill for say that this be not an air pollution issue it be clearly not an air pollution issue from his point of view we know why he have bring the bill forward because of the election come up on may it be desperate last ditch attempt to try to boost the conservative vote and think we know how that will turn out perhaps some conservative members ought to be out and about talk to voter on the doorstep rather than take up our time here today if they really want to influence the result of that election the hon member who have leave the chamber now may not feel that ulez be an air pollution issue but very much feel that it be because low emission be public health issue in my role as shadow climate change minister people often come and talk to about air pollution as though it be primarily net zero issue and we have see some depressing attempt to make net zero part of the anti woke culture war by say that net zero come at cost we see the secretary of state for transport buy into the whole conspiracy theory about minute city at party conference which be incredibly depressing reduce emission from transport be obviously very much part of our ambition to meet net zero but the immediate driver be the need to clean up our air we have hear mention of the switch to electric vehicle it be obviously the long term objective that we want to ensure that all the vehicle on our road reach safe emission standard it be therefore disappointing that the government row back the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicle the signal that that send to the market and consumer be entirely counterproductive although initially there be some resistance to target rather than target within the car manufacturing trade the trade then get with the programme and be critical of the government for that row back because it affect sale it have make the switch and be produce ev it be still bind by zero emission vehicle mandate so it be make the new electric vehicle the most important thing we can do this go to the point about people not be able to afford clean vehicle that be compliant with the ulez be to develop second hand electric vehicle market as quickly as possible we do that by increase new ev sale the figure have go down bit but it be the case that of new ev sale something per cent be fleet vehicle we know that they then come on to the second hand market pretty quickly we have to bring down the cost of buy ev can see the right hon member for bexleyheath and crayford sir david evennett nodding and we do not do that by push the ban back to we need to bring it in now we also need action on ev charging infrastructure will say thank you to the government for provide some new money for charge infrastructure in the west of england think that bristol be the good place outside london in this regard but what be lack be national strategy to put the infrastructure into place where the market will not meet the need because there be not the necessary footfall or whatever the drive equivalent be particularly in our rural area that depend on tourism those travel down to devon and cornwall can use exeter service but after that it be pretty difficult to find somewhere to charge car as have an ev and can not charge it at home because live in block of flat welcome the public charging point in bristol spend far too much time sit in car park do duolingo and practise my very bad russian while charge my car it be quite sad when constituent spot do that although we need more charge point in our city include london this be national infrastructure and we must roll it out to other part of the country as have say believe that the immediate imperative be not reduce transport emission with the aim of reach net zero but deal with air pollution which we know have significant impact on people health and on child health in particular when be at school there be just one girl in my class with asthma but nowadays the majority of kid in any inner city primary school probably have it child be more vulnerable in this regard because their airway be small and still develop because they be close to traffic fume because they be small and because they breathe more rapidly they be also more likely to develop more serious lung condition in later life although of course asthma can be very serious moreover air pollution affect the lung development of foetus in utero and increase the chance of miscarriage if mother be expose to large volume of air pollution during pregnancy the baby be more likely to be bear prematurely and with low birth weight which be correlate with the development of certain health problem as child grow up pay tribute to group such as asthma lung uk and mums for lungs which have be do some very good campaigning in my constituency while st george breathing better have be push for school street scheme to restrict the entry of high emit vehicle especially when child be go in and out of school do not know whether my hon friend have find this in her constituency but in mine there have certainly be significant rise in the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the response have not be particularly helpful in recent year in term of acknowledgment proper diagnosis and speed of reaction to the problem but that too relate to the air pollution issue think that be true and it be also connect with poor housing condition we have talk in this place before about the need to ensure that home be fit for human habitation young boy tragically die recently because of the mould in his home all these thing be connect in the last few week have be diagnose with adult onset asthma which be on the rise we know that of case be trigger by allergy and that much of this be link with mould in people home what my hon friend be say and she be make powerful speech go to the heart of why we need to tackle this issue for all our constituent whether young or old suffer from hay fever virtually all the year round would have think it would be bad in the countryside but it be terrible when be in london be in paris in january and the hay fever take off suddenly because of the air pollution level hay fever be not lethal in the way that asthma attack can be but it be pretty grim condition to have to live with it affect people ability to do their work and to study for instance as say early the government be force to act on air pollution after be take to court by clientearth to which pay tribute for its continue effort through the legal system to hold the government to account in respect of their environmental target as result of that court case bristol be ask to act have already make the point about the irony perhaps of demand local autonomy in some case and demand not to be tell what to do by the mayor of london but in bristol the secretary of state tell we we have to do that the hon lady be make fair point but we have to recognise the issue of scale in bristol the clean air zone be barely square mile it be about mile by mile and specifically take into account individual and business the bill introduce by my hon friend the member for dartford do not seek to get rid of the congestion zone or the first ulez expansion yet the second expansion of ulez in contrast to bristol square mile be approximately square mile at mile by mile that be so monumentally big than anything contemplate in bristol or other city london have the greater london assembly mayor with devolved power and transport for london so this issue be look at on london wide basis there be an issue in bristol with people come into the city centre from place like bath but the borough be not so interwoven that we can not see the border between they and we do not have the interconnectivity that london have in bristol we be tell that we have to bring air pollution level within legal limit as quickly as possible we go to great length with the modelling to deal with concern about the economic and social impact as the minister say make the zone as small as possible be one of the factor in that it be relevant to talk about the bristol scheme because it show what can be achieve by similar measure in london the scheme come into effect in november and in january this year we have the first annual report on its effectiveness it be judge to have be highly successful the headline figure be that air pollution across all measure site have decline by the success of the caz be measure by whether it lower nitrogen dioxide level below the legal limit of microgram per cubic metre in november when the scheme be introduce there be site across bristol above the legal limit just month later that be down to just six zone the scheme be particularly effective outside the bristol royal infirmary and the bristol children hospital which be bang in the middle of the city centre air pollution be down by an incredible defy anyone to tell that such big improvement in air quality in area where there be very sick and vulnerable people include sick child be bad thing it have be really successful do my hon friend share my concern that this be sometimes present as binary choice between motorist and everybody else such as the child in the hospital when these improvement be actually beneficial for everyone one thing that come out of the report be that some of the bad air quality be inside vehicle so motorist directly benefit from improvement in air quality be on the environmental audit committee and the environment food and rural affairs committee at the time both of which take part in that inquiry it be difficult to bring those committees together but the inquiry produce really good significant report which we should still pay heed to when we as house think about what to do on this issue go forward there seem to be focus on motorist but there be now multiplicity of electric vehicle have get one of they use to have an electric bike but now have an electric scooter not sit down scooter find it particularly effective in my constituency although to be frank my constituent do frown when turn up as the mp because they think should be deliver pizza there be multiplicity of vehicle option that we can deploy to tackle some of these air pollution problem but we need more incentive from central government to develop that multiplicity my right hon friend be absolutely correct do have an bike it be steal from inside the houses of parliament one would think that there would be nowhere more secure but when the queen be lie in state whoever be act as her security remove all the bike and take off lock presumably with an angle grinder or something and my bike be not see again try explain to the insurance company that it be people from buckingham palace or from the queen lie in state who take the lock off that be another story though my right hon friend be entirely right use to hold the shadow green transport brief and bike be hugely important in allow people to do those long journey could not make it up the hill in bristol without bit of extra help from an bike but when it come to delivery vehicle one of the issue be delivery inside the area cover by zone if we can have hub outside the city centre and electric van or cargo bike make those delivery that could have huge impact obviously everybody make food delivery and similar thing really ought to be use clean mode of transport be conscious of time so will finish my point about the bristol scheme there be concern that it would lead people to take diversion and increase pollution outside the clean air zone but air pollution outside the zone have also be measure as down it have reduce by because the caz have encourage modal shift among people appreciate that people can not always afford to make that shift in vehicle but it have happen another concern raise by opponent be that the caz would harm the local economy and community by discourage people from come into the city centre in fact the opposite happen retail footfall across four major retail hotspot in central bristol actually rise from the previous year there be also an argument that people would become isolated and stick at home because they could not afford to pay the charge but again that be not the case the number of journey into or through the caz per month be high at the end of the year than at the start of the scheme and the percentage of compliant journey rise every single month that be what we want to achieve it be the same with the landfill tax for example that tax be not about raise money because lot of people be send stuff to landfill if landfill tax be effective the revenue go down and down year on year there be actually an issue with the fact that the tax be not keep pace with inflation at the moment but assume it be effective the revenue will dwindle it be the behaviour change that we want to make happen as say ideally we would not have introduce clean air zone but we have make it work it be also worth note that the government take from every caz charge which we would very much like to be able to spend in bristol instead it be quite difficult to assess the effectiveness of clean air zone because it be not about whether vehicle number go down but about whether those number be high or low than they would have be if we have do nothing when think about the effectiveness of ulez in central london for example we need to model what would have happen if we have not have ulez rather than just look at whether the number have go up or down exactly there be very complicated modelling involve also if we can use measure such as these to take some car off the road that increase the attractiveness of public transport because the bus can get to where they be mean to be without be stick in traffic surely the hon lady be make an argument in support of the bill for have small congestion zone in the centre of city allow the public transport to get to where it be mean to be but not massive square mile congestion zone such as the present expand ulez be think in the context of the right hon member for bexleyheath and crayford sir david evennett say that he do not have tube station in his part of greater london as though the only alternative to the tube be drive london have pretty decent bus system but we need to make sure that people have that alternative again be go to say something nice we have have confirmation today that first bus have receive funding under the next wave of the zero emission bus regional area scheme to turn all of our bus into electric vehicle we have be experiment with biogas but that funding will do an awful lot we do have some clean biogas bus and my right hon and learn friend the leader of the labour party get to drive one on one of his previous visit to the city he be like little boy with new toy it have to be say think he greatly enjoy it give that the evidence show that ulez have cut pollution in central london by almost half the challenge that the minister be present slightly misread how people travel around london as an outer london mp be acutely conscious that people also drive within the borough to work as well as between outer london borough the idea that we would have the same impact on reduce pollution just by focus on the centre miss the challenge that we be all try to address nobody be say that this be easy or that it be not controversial have the north circular run through my constituency and see the pollution see child and adult struggle with the consequence and be sure the same be true in south london we have to consider how people travel around london to understand the good way of tackle these issue it can not just be theoretical it have to be practical model do it not my hon friend be right and she bring on to my final point her borough of waltham forest host the mini holland scheme which have cycle around on an bike each week the council transport lead take people on tour so that they can learn from the scheme these local scheme can transform neighbourhood by design out some of the traffic and make they pleasant place to live by build thing like sustainable urban drainage scheme and area where people can sit and talk liveable neighbourhood pilot be just about to start in my constituency it be important to engage the local community to explain how it will work for they and to listen when they say how it might cause problem in certain area although there have be some opposition group such as st george breathing better which be found by group of parent whose child be suffer because of the city air pollution be very much behind the pilot return to the secretary of state disappointing remark about minute city as well as big measure such as ulez to address greater london transport problem we need to consider local solution such as liveable neighbourhood and school street scheme to encourage people to walk to school and work and to make it as easy as possible for people to get around without resort to their car this should be about give elect politician the right to implement such solution in consultation with the people they represent thank my hon friend the member for dartford gareth johnson for introduce this bill which it be my great pleasure to support member across the house will agree that we want clean air for our resident today and for generation to come across london and in my constituency in the outer suburb of uxbridge and south ruislip we all agree that nobody want dirty or poor quality air however the labour mayor of london expansion of ulez to outer london have nothing to do with air quality and everything to do with punish hard work family and business of all size several month after he totally ignore londoners and press ahead with expand the ulez tax across outer london like fellow conservative members continue to be contact by people share example of financial hardship collapse business and negative social consequence as it stand believe the bill would go some way towards rectify blatant money grab by call for the transport secretary to consent to any expansion of ulez and the ulez boundary once they have be amend as per the bill which spell out number of important qualification among they be whether any propose change be in accordance with mayor manifesto commitment at the most recent mayoral election the mayor of london make no mention of ulez expansion in his manifesto and he certainly make no mention of it to the people of uxbridge and south ruislip but that be not all the ulez expansion democratic deficit do not stop there along with the lack of any mention of ulez in his manifesto the mayor of london embark on consultation that due to raft of allegation include on the weighting give to particular consultation response among other issue have leave multiple question about its validity be glad to see that confront in the bill which would require the secretary of state to consider response to any consultation conduct on propose change if the mayor have put more time and effort into speak to resident across outer london and indeed in uxbridge and south ruislip he would have understand that they be not far right conspiracy theorist these hard work family and business owner be ignore and continue to be ignore why do the mayor of london not consider use fund to bring about new fleet of green bus electrify the taxi network plant more tree or ensure that the tube run on much clean energy let we not forget properly fund scrappage scheme those alternative would have produce real bind change in people life not just in how they travel around outer london but in how they interact with their community and their surrounding rather than explore sensible common sense alternative the mayor of london choose to spend hundred of million of pound on ulez enforcement camera uxbridge and south ruislip be heavily reliant on car usage due to the nature of its outer london geography the people have the privilege of represent could opt to use public transport but we see how the mayor of london be decimate local bus service and continue to preside over the ongoing catastrophic failure of the central line email and social medium comment flood in from constituent who be rightly angry about an unacceptable and unreliable public transport service why force ulez expansion on area with minimal and long term unreliable public transport without first rectify those issue why not invest more in the public transport network so that people can rely on it and then decide to make the switch why do he push ahead with ulez expansion first the answer be clear to continue ignore hard work londoner and punish they with destructive money grab thinly disguise as an environmental strategy with little or no substance know all too well about the anger and frustration feel by ordinary hard work people in uxbridge and south ruislip and indeed those across outer london about the mayor cynical money grab in my maiden speech state stand here no long the local candidate but the member of parliament still determined to fight the mayor of london money grab and reduce the burden place on my resident and local business official report november vol those word still re true only this week the mayor of london make comment cite that the sky do fall in follow the expansion of ulez well it do for business who can no long afford to trade and for household who have incur financial hardship those flippant and arrogant comment cement the view that the mayor of london be out of touch with hard work londoners the bill have my full support as it look to vary ulez boundary and ensure that safeguard be in place for oversight and consultation in addition to support the bill want to place on record in the house my wholehearte support for the conservative candidate for mayor of london susan hall rise to speak in opposition to the bill it be interesting to follow the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip steve tuckwell on the day that he be elect to this place remember campaign and talk to resident who say we be not go to vote labour as we have always do before because we have to pay every day to drive on our local road my colleague say how will it affect you what car do you drive and the guy at this one house say well there it be it toyota prius on the day of that election thousand of people be tell and some still believe that every single person drive vehicle in greater london have to pay day that be not true and that myth be still go around do not want to undermine the fact that about of vehicle in london be non compliant accept that the expansion force people who drive non compliant vehicle for work or for personal use to make decision as other have to when the original ulez boundary be introduce will come on to that aspect of the scrappage scheme later the hon lady will be aware that transport for london impact assessment state that there be likely to be disproportionate negative impact for people on low income who travel by non compliant private vehicle in outer london to access employment or opportunity it be those organisation and individual who be be affect by the policy as have say will come on to the detail of the scrappage scheme later can address that point because my constituency be cross by the north and south circular so we have already be there as we know the bill propose to amend the boundary of the greater london low emission zone and ultra low emission zone and provide that transport for london in other word the london mayor may not make an order amend those boundary without the consent of the secretary of state under the greater london authority act transport in london be devolved matter and the responsibility of the mayor and as such parliament grant the power to make decision on london wide road charge scheme to the mayor the propose change pose threat to the power of the mayor of london the greater london authority and devolve place around the country be disappointed that the minister have announce that the government will support this bill give their long stand position that local road charge power be the responsibility of the mayor and any support for such bill be regressive and anti devolution the previous mayor of london before become conservative prime minister introduce the ulez which come into operation in april in october he ensure its extension to the north and south circular road the current mayor of london as we know then extend it to all of greater london in august the bill seek to revert we to have the boundary at the north and south circular road can not see the logic in that devolution be one of the key issue here along with tackle air pollution the ulez stem from government legislation which local government be require to abide by and which be first champion in london by conservative mayor of london under the greater london authority act serve on the bill committee for that act at first the conservative party oppose the restoration of mayor for london and greater london authority but as we go through the legislation an element of consensus build up particularly in the local government community and among london mps about the sort of power that the mayor and the gla should have include around these sort of issue there be consensus that if we establish these structure they would need to be properly empower and then there be debate about resource the bill before we fly in the face of the debate on that act as say be on that committee and if remember rightly glenda jackson be the minister thank my right hon friend who be member of the greater london council which be abolish by conservative government who do not like what the labour london government be do so much for respect for local politician under the greater london authority act transport and air quality in london be devolve matter that be the responsibility of the mayor and transport for london the bill be an affront to the principle of devolution and the principle of allow local leader to make the decision need to deliver local priority and meet objective set by national government air pollution be health crisis there be national air crisis target to tackle that be rightly set by central government across the country the government have require and encourage the introduction of clean air zone the bill be plainly party political point scoring give that the government have require and encourage many other clean air zone across the country the bill seek to amend the boundary of the greater london low emission zone and ultra low emission zone to provide that transport for london may not make an order amend those boundary without the consent of the secretary of state the boundary of the zone would be amend so that the new boundary would be the edge of the inner zone that is the new boundary would be the boundary that be put in place in october before the zone be expand up to but not include the north and south circular give the concern of driver come from dartford and other place into london what be the logic of remove ulez from outer london but not inner london surely the hon member for dartford gareth johnson represent resident and business who drive into central london either oppose ulez or support ulez this bill be neither one thing nor the other the bill will prevent tfl from amend the boundary without the express consent of the secretary of state it would restrict the ability of the mayor of london and tfl to make amendment to the charge area by force the greater london authority to request permission from the secretary of state first and would place duty on the secretary of state to consider london election manifesto commitment it be very bizarre the bill mean that there will be contradictory decision make in different part of the country the bill strike as be part of historical antipathy on the part of conservative government to labour leader in greater london as other have say eloquently this government could do so much more to address air pollution they could support the mayor of london make the scrappage scheme more generous so that nobody have any reason not to get rid of their non compliant vehicle if the cost for non pollute vehicle come down there would be no non compliant vehicle pollute london that be important because of the impact that pollution have on our community and the people of this country air pollution be the no environmental threat to public health in the uk it contribute to up to premature death every year in england in his annual report chief medical officer professor sir chris whitty outline that outdoor air pollution in england still pose significant health threat to adult and child an increase body of evidence link air pollution to various cancer lung and heart disease dementia and stroke it put we all at great risk of disease and shorten live furthermore toxic air be hold back our public service and make it hard to treat other condition public health england estimate that air pollution will cost the nhs and the social care system billion between and that rise to billion when we include the impact of disease for which the evidence of an association be less developed and still emerge by that figure will reach almost billion unless strong action be take in addition report commission by the clean air fund conclude that improve air quality could boost the uk economy by billion each year as result of million additional working day be work and reduction in the rate of early retirement in in london toxic air contribute to around premature death the great number of death attributable to air pollution be in outer london borough mainly due to the high proportion in those area of elderly people who be more vulnerable to the impact of air pollution hardly see she now but work with wonderful tenant activist in brentford when be councillor she have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and be confine to bed about year ago she have not be able to leave her bedroom because of copd she have live all her life in brentford which have always have very high air pollution from the coke work and the proximity to the and the she be just one example but we all know people who suffer from copd emphysema and whole range of other life limit and life damage condition if no further action be take to reduce air pollution around londoner will develop disease relate to poor air quality in the next year the cost of that for the nhs and social care system in london alone be estimate to be billion by more than half million londoner suffer from asthma and be more vulnerable to the effect of toxic air and more than half of those people live in outer london toxic air be social justice issue the poor londoner and londoner from ethnic minority background who be least likely to own car be worst affect by toxic air only of the low income londoner own car yet they be more likely to suffer from toxic air half of all the child admit to hospital due to asthma in london be from minority ethnic background how can we ever forget the case of ella kissi debrah the first person in the world to have air pollution list as cause of death on her death certificate she be child who grow up in flat overlook busy road in south east london have meet ella mother have also work with campaign group such as mums for lungs parent be campaign for we to do the right thing they support the ulez and they ask we have have two or three email on this already this week to oppose this bill want to say little about my constituency and why this issue matter there from one end of my constituency to the other we be affect by heavy traffic and therefore high air pollution that can be see from the map we have the the above and the which come in from the the north and south circular meet at their westerly point in my constituency all those road be all hugely congested and have very polluted air the last ulez boundary go through the middle of my constituency just inside the north and south circular there we have mary catholic primary school and william hogarth school next door to each other alongside the in chiswick the pollution at those school be incredibly high parent there lead by one of the father andrea carnevali have campaign for year to address the issue their campaign have mean that the issue of air pollution have get into the public domain locally through their campaigning those parent manage to get support from the mayor of london for green wall along the playground side of the wall to try to catch some of the pollution they have also work with paint manufacturer remarkably air pollution level inside classroom can be reduce with particular paint the school be donate the paint to do measurement and assessment so that everybody could see its efficacy sadly it be too expensive for school to buy because it be so specialist but that be the sort of thing the government should be support until air pollution level drop they be start to drop and will come on to that child who go to st mary william hogarth and other school in my constituency and across london will be go into classroom play in playground and walk and cycle to and from school in environment that be limit their life expectancy want to pick up on two letter receive from parent this week this be from mother who tell about her son he use to attend school situate just one block from the as it go into london through chiswick and hammersmith she write that he use to suffer from asthma and he use to tell we how he could breathe so much well when we be away from london he have die from cancer his mother say although his primary tumour be in his left humerus he die from the bone cancer which have spread to his lung and we now suspect that it have be in his lung for quite some time that be why she have ask to oppose the bill today she add another thing in her note when take my son to hospital once for something unrelated be on ward with he with three other child who all have breathing difficulty when ask the nurse about this she say they consistently have child admit for breathing problem that remind of my visit to school over the year from when be councillor and subsequently as an mp grow number of school have to have an asthma strategy and grow bank of drawer full of asthma inhaler just in case those inhaler be use more and more child be use asthma inhaler day in day out so that they be able to make the most of school the second email be in way more general but it still explain from constituent point of view why will oppose the bill today my constituent write as the dad of two young boy who have to expose they to pollution every single day on the school run particularly over kew bridge over the river but highly polluted support any and all effort to clean up london air the ulez be strategy to protect public health in lieu of alternative policy that could address this horrific health challenge the ulez be the most effective strategy we have for london and that be why the mayor for london be use it the ulez be highly targeted it help to take the most polluting vehicle off london road vehicle that do not meet certain emission standard and be not otherwise subject to grace period discount or exemption must pay the charge to travel within the city the charge be set to disincentivise frequent trip in non compliant vehicle that would otherwise contribute more to air pollution it incentivise people to change their travel behaviour for example to use public transport more or to replace their vehicle while allow occasional visitor and infrequent driver an alternative the london wide expansion have already be highly effective in reduce the proportion and number of old more polluting vehicle on london road datum from the london wide ulez first month report show percentage point increase in vehicle compliance in outer london with of vehicle see drive in london on an average day now meet ulez standard that be up from when the consultation be launch in may and mean that compliance rate in outer london have nearly catch up with inner london as have be say any net revenue raise from ulez will be re invest back into public transport include the expansion of bus service in outer london be not aware of bus service that have be cut but there be no doubt that we could always do with more bus service more frequent service and more night and weekend service so that few people be force to get their car out in order to get to work visit friend and relative and so on the ulez have be hugely successful in central and inner london and have lead to significant benefit harmful concentration alongside road such as the and the in my constituency be estimate to be low in central london and low in inner london than they would have be without the ulez the number of school in area exceed legal limit for fall by an amazing from in to just in mum for lungs be keen to remind we of those figure it say that on an average day there be few unique non compliant vehicle compare with june as well as an overall reduction of few non compliant vehicle per day within the ulez zone the ulez have help to reduce all harmful nox by in central london and by in inner london monitor in the capital show that london enjoy the clean air on record in as result of ulez there be still long way to go for london to meet world health organisation air quality guideline and forecast show that all of london will continue to exceed those guideline in and without further action that go back to what the government be do beyond london it be the uk government view that clean air and low emission zone be the preferred option for improve air quality in the short possible time but more must be do to incentivise the use of low and zero emission vehicle than what the government be do we be already begin to see the expect benefit of expand the ulez and it be estimate that million more people include the constituent of some conservative members be expect to breathe clean air as result of expand ulez to outer london modelling suggest that the current ulez be expect to reduce exhaust emission in outer london by nearly lead to overall reduction in emission those be the one that cause severe lung disease it will lead to reduction of nearly in nitrogen oxide emission in outer london and to few car trip overall which be an almost reduction as one of my colleague say early the bad place to be in term of air pollution be inside car so if few car trip be make that should mean that few people be expose to emission inside car as well as externally the ulez be expect to save tonne of emission in outer london so this be about not just air pollution but climate change the issue we have focus on today be respiratory condition but like my hon friend have be work on air pollution issue around our airport do not know whether she will remember this but when we look at the matter perhaps year ago the issue we raise be the incidence of cancer she have mention cancer itself we then discover the chicago airport study which link cancer to air pollution and highlight the significance of that for airport and the surround area we should not underestimate the impact that ulez could have not only on overcome respiratory problem but on reduce cancer incidence in area such as ours number of our key campaigner in the area have suffer from cancer and we consider that it be link to the air pollution around the airport thank my right hon friend for that have work with he for many year on issue relate to heathrow we can not separate the issue of vehicle congestion and air pollution from the issue around heathrow airport which do not do enough to incentivise its staff and its passenger to come to the airport by mean other than car say that would cover the issue of scrappage have continue to listen to the concern of londoners the mayor and tfl expand the scrappage scheme to provide support for more londoner the mayor be provide million funding pot for the scrappage scheme to support all londoner with an eligible car or motorcycle as well as charity sole trader and small business it be the most generous scrappage scheme ever see in the uk as part of the scheme any london resident with an eligible non compliant car can apply for grant of up to to scrap it neighbour of mine have nice little runaround car that cost and be compliant so anyone who say that it be not possible to buy compliant car for that kind of money have not try to do it other more extended benefit be available for example disabled people who need to scrap or retrofit non compliant wheelchair accessible car can apply for grant of up to to scrap or to retrofit charity sole trader and business with few than employee that be register in london can apply for grant of to scrap van to scrap minibus or to retrofit certain van or minibus they can also apply to scrap and replace van or minibus with fully electric vehicle for which the grant be and respectively eligible organisation can scrap or retrofit up to three vehicle as of march applicant to the ulez scrappage scheme can donate their non ulez compliant vehicle to support humanitarian and medical need in ukraine in return for the same level of grant payment that be available to those who choose to scrap their vehicle the government have provide scrappage funding for other city include birmingham bristol sheffield and portsmouth but they have not provide similar arrangement for specific ringfence funding for london that be yet another sectarian attack by the conservative government on labour mayor air pollution be health crisis and target to tackle it be rightfully set by central government across the country the government have require and encourage the introduction of clean air zone the bill be plainly party political point scoring give that the government have require and encourage many other clean air zone across the country this bill be challenge to the power of the mayor of london to make decision that improve the health of londoners all londoners if successful the bill have the potential to do significant damage reinforce inequity in public health and undermine the office of the mayor of london the bill be an attack on devolution the mayor have right to introduce measure within his power to meet statutory target set by central government but they be dictate how democratically elect mayor of london should run the city and that be counter to the principle of devolution labour be party of devolution we create the mayoral model in london the scottish parliament the welsh parliament and the northern ireland assembly and promote local and regional decision making and funding across england this bill be an attack not only on devolution but on measure to improve our environment and the health of our child and our child child we have to have solution to the air quality crisis and the cost of living crisis both nationally and locally labour be clear that the government have direct responsibility to work with local authority to enable clean air zone and alternative to they and there need to be range of alternative air quality improvement method include re rout traffic land management speed limit well public transport and make it easy to acquire non pollute vehicle that responsibility should extend to help to mitigate the impact of any proposal that clear the strong threshold set by the government for clean air zone do not hear about any alternative from those on the government benches so whose side be the supporter of the bill on continue pollution or find solution to stop our child die want to read out the end of the email that receive from the father mention early pollution be too high in london it make we sick and long term exposure can reduce cognitive ability be proud that london have the world large clean air zone the ulez be brave and important policy which will be historic legacy for the london mayor will not speak for long because do not want to delay passage of this important bill which have be happy to support my hon friend the member for dartford gareth johnson in bring to this place today we will see whose side labour be really on the labour mayor of london who have introduce this regressive and greenwashe tax on outer london or the hard work people in greater london who be struggle to pay labour tax of per day or per year for go to work medical appointment or the supermarket this week the leader of the opposition have finally get off his fence and disgracefully back the labour mayor of london over the interest of hard work londoner today we have hear that the hon member for eltham clive efford for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury and for walthamstow stella creasy also back the labour mayor of london over their constituent but the conservatives will continue to back driver in greater london and the home county and be pleased that the government support the bill do my hon friend agree that this be less about clean air and more about take my constituent in watford and those elsewhere to the cleaner the scheme taxis hard work people who just want to get to work when we say hard work people that include those who work in hospital and who want to work elsewhere in london to contribute to the local economy include the night time economy band that want to go and do gig in london be now be price out of be able to do so and those who want to go and see they be be price out too it be absolutely wrong and need to be stop those who do not want to back the bill really need to look in the mirror and consider why they be not help hard work people thank my hon friend who be real champion of his constituent as he have just point out people who come into london at night face the double charge of to come in and then go out that equally apply to the night time industry we have hear lot about the scrappage scheme but accord to the ulez datum from tfl only one in three van driver who have apply for support have receive any completely agree with my hon friend and my hon friend the member for dartford that this tax on hard work people be hurt people in the like of bexley which be inside the zone and those just outside with the mayor of london take million of pound each month from the pocket of driver via fine and charge while at the same time refuse to publish any meaningful evidence that prove that the ulez in outer london actually improve air quality the public out there do not need to tell they how much of greenwashe con the ulez expansion really be will the hon gentleman give way no the hon gentleman have only just come in the public do not need to tell they that london devolution be break with tfl require government bail out after government bail out london now be the slow city in the world to drive in and the metropolitan police and london fire brigade in special measure credit my hon friend for the speech he be give be not the key issue here the democratic deficit for those outside the mayoral zone decision be make by the mayor which we know be not back by manifesto and it be now impact the wide community my hon and right hon friend represent from harlow to bexley and crayford surely the issue be how we navigate the desire to comply with the legislation that be why the bill from my hon friend the member for dartford gareth johnson do not say that we be scrap it entirely and the ability of individual to have their say on whether this be the appropriate measure thank the roads minister for his intervention agree completely there be huge democratic deficit at play here as he correctly point out the charge affect people outside the zone who need to come into london and it be have significant negative impact on the like of crayford and bexley village in my constituency which be hundred of meter away from the so call london boundary and whose business be lose customer every single day because of the expansion the people of bexley who quite clearly reject this policy in the sham of public consultation we have have be completely ignore that be why have no doubt that in few week time they will be vote like will to sack sadiq khan after eight year of failure the public out there do not need to tell they that london and the surround county can not afford another four year of sadiq khan and labour run london the plan to toll the blackwall tunnel and install camera on small residential close and road show that ulez be not the end of the mayor desire to hammer motorist in bexley and outer london people can look up project detroit themselves on may londoners will be able to vote for susan hall and vote for change to make london well and safe for everybody people in greater london do not need to tell they who be on their side they will see it with their own eye as the labour party desperately try to block this bill be grateful for the opportunity to speak on an issue that be of the utmost importance for my constituent draw all member attention to bill no on the order paper which be my private member bill the landlord and tenant act amendment bill it be about clean air take action on mould and give private landlord more power to take action and ensure that they have to take action my bill be connect to the bill we be debate because my constituent often suffer the double whammy of live in poor cheap housing that be on main road they be very unlikely to have car the majority of my constituent do not and be more likely to suffer from the effect of air pollution and to have mould in their home many of my constituent talk to about this issue so if we get to my bill hope all member will support it do my hon friend agree that it would be well for we to spend parliamentary time look at comprehensive strategy that tackle air pollution and respiratory condition rather than go down this rabbit hole today the issue she raise with her legislation which hope the government will support could be foundation stone for we to tackle the problem of housing and respiratory condition absolutely agree with my right hon friend there be many well thing we could be discuss here than try to turn back the clock on progressive and life change policy that have be bring in by the mayor we could be discuss the renters reform bill or action on respiratory health or whole number of thing that my constituent would like to see we discuss instead of this bill object to the principle of the bill as well as its substance the bill propose to amend the boundary of the greater london low emission zone and ultra low emission zone to provide that transport for london may not make an order amend those boundary without the consent of the secretary of state and legislate for connect purpose in london we vote to have mayor and vote for who that mayor would be and we support our mayor in london make decision about our road parliament grant the power to make decision on london wide road charge scheme to the mayor this bill be try to take power away from the mayor it be play politic with our constitutional arrangement and it be quite clear why do my hon friend agree that the bill be particularly disingenuous because number of the air quality mandate change be the result of european and national decision it be not just sadiq khan or other people unilaterally do it it be be do because the whole of britain need to improve its air quality which be currently produce real and harmful effect for our constituent be glad that my hon friend have raise that point the government have ask council in bristol and birmingham for example to bring in clean air zone and have ask for one to be bring in in london as well hope the government will not be support the bill today because it would be against their policy of give more people clean air across the country any propose change to devolve power would pose threat to the exist power of the mayor and the london assembly and to those of devolved institution across the country it start here where will it go we can not just have the government take back power willy nilly and whenever they like because mayoral election be due to take place in few week time the mayor of london introduce the world first hour ulez in central london in to bring in health benefit and expand it in that expansion bring the health benefit that be the result of the first ulez to million more people and more child roll that back would mean bad air for those million people and child can not believe that the government would support this bill the ulez be highly target scheme that be set to disincentivise frequent trip in non compliant vehicle it certainly have that effect on have diesel car which buy back in the day when we be tell that diesel be well choice for the environment realise that it be not and the fact that the ulez be come speed up my decision to not have car we do not have car as family we have not have one for three year do not think we would have make that jump if it have not be for the ulez come in we think we would see how it go and it be go fine we do not have car we do not need one and be not drive around in car that be pollute the air in putney be it not also the case that even if my hon friend be to have car the vast majority of car as she well know and as have be mention in this debate which have be listen to be ulez compliant have year old petrol car do not drive it in london because be not maniac but if do would not be ulez charge because it be small lightweight petrol car the vast majority be perfectly fine absolutely agree member ask early for datum on the ulez scheme and the effect it have have datum from the first month report show percentage point increase in vehicle compliance in outer london with of vehicle see drive in london on an average day now meet the ulez standard up from when the consultation be launch in may that mean that vehicle compliance rate in outer london have nearly catch up with inner london which be have good effect the decision to expand the ulez be difficult one for the mayor but it be feel necessary to save life protect londoners health and tackle the climate crisis agree because in toxic air contribute to around premature death in london just because we can not see the smog as be the case back in the day of the great smog that lead to the first clean air act do not mean that it be not all around we we can see the impact in our hospital it be mainly parent and doctor who write to in support of the legislation that the mayor have introduce to clean up our air because it be doctor who see the effect of air pollution rise level of asthma cancer heart disease stroke and dementia in our hospital if no further action be take to reduce air pollution over the next year around londoner will develop disease relate to poor air quality that will cost the nhs and social care system in london billion by air pollution cost live but it also cost our public service the first inner london ulez contribute to reduction in child be admit to hospital with asthma think those result speak for themselves how can we argue against that take action on the climate emergency and clean air be one of the reason become an mp one of the first thing do when become an mp be set up the putney environment commission rather grand sound group of local people who want to take action locally nationally and internationally we have several open meeting to decide what we would do one of the first thing we do be run putney first ever clean air fair it be clean air that everyone want to take action on hundred of people attend the fair there be stall from brilliant local organisation include friend of wandsworth park friends of wimbledon park little ninja uk wandsworth living streets the roehampton garden society putney community gardens the putney society friends of the earth wandsworth the putney pollution busters green the grid and cycle buddies hon member can see how many local organisation we have that really care about clean air the number of resident who contribute to the event and who come to check out the stall on the day and ask what they could do or how they could push for more action show the huge concern in putney roehampton southfields and wandsworth town for clean air we will be hold second fair this year on may to which invite all member here today mr deputy speaker if you would like to come to that event it be at wandsworth park we would love to see you there we will be talk about action that everyone can take on clean air about save our green space about active travel and about green bus all the way in which alongside the ulez action can be take on so many occasion while out canvass speak to parent who introduce to their child who they say have asthma it happen time after time so many child in the school visit be now affect go to school in roehampton recently and ask the headteacher what the main issue be be expect to talk about the curriculum and ofsted we do talk about that or other issue but she say that the main issue be mould and air quality which be keep child off school she have have to introduce adaption strategy in the school to take action on that it be horrify that that be what she be say in this day and age my hon friend make an important point about active travel be massive fan of active travel as know colleague present be too but if we be to get more people walk cycling wheel and run we need decent air quality in every town and city across the country that be why it be so important to have thing that bring air quality back to an acceptable standard absolutely we want more people cycle and walk to take car off the road and make they less congested for those who have to drive we want to see an impact on active travel but one that support the business on the roadside in our community it be unfair on the majority of constituent who do not have car and those who live on the main road in less expensive housing to bear the burden of air pollution the hon lady be make fair point about the impact of air pollution on the main road do she therefore agree that it be somewhat strange that the large investment that the labour mayor of london will have make during his term as mayor will be the billion silvertown road tunnel which will encourage heavy good vehicle to drive along the and into central london that be why the green party and the conservatives be oppose to it would point to other such as the superloop the new bus that will go around london and the elizabeth line the mayor will be able to invest more in public service because of the revenue from the ulez scheme enable people to travel on our public transport that be the action we need to take to really clean up our air have even take to the street for clean air day to measure the clean air or the polluted air on putney high street use an ultra fine particle counter lend to by the environmental research group at imperial college london it be amazing to take the counter out for the day and see the effect of air pollution as go down some of our main road upper richmond road lower richmond road and putney high street see spike when bus and pollute car come by think there would be constant level of dirty and polluted air but it go up and down could see the impact of diesel bus and pollute car think of all the time that have take my child to primary school in wandsworth over year walk along very polluted road all that time it be damage their lung this be worry for to see and for my constituent to know about my hon friend be talk about damage to lung but will she also mention the damage that air pollution do to the brain these microscopic particle and nanoparticle such as can cross the blood brain barrier and can cause long term developmental problem for child that mean the brain never function properly even if the air be later clean up that be why it be important to get it right now air pollution be like tick timebomb for our child it have be show that child who live on polluted road in inner london have small lung and that their lung will never fully grow pollution also have an impact on the brain potentially include dementia in later life we owe it to our child to have this increase ulez zone to clean up our air we have recently make progress on putney high street since do the monitoring we have large proportion of green have make significant difference we need to get to and the mayor have plan we need this robust action for the sake of our health and child both in this chamber and on the environment bill committee have call many time for new clean air act mayor include sadiq khan in london need to introduce measure so that we be able to see an impact across the country accord to asthma lung uk more than people in greater london have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and nearly of they live in outer london outer london members need to be concerned about their constituent and the impact on their health be pleased with the mayor action include the increase to more than zero emission bus on london road he have also rapidly expand london fleet of green bus with the capital now boast more green bus than any other city in western europe he have also deliver increase in the number of public electric vehicle charging point with london now boast more than third of the uk total my hon friend be make an excellent speech do she agree that the mayor of london have consistently demonstrate that he be do everything in his power under london devolution settlement to improve air quality for londoners do she share my concern that he be somewhat hamstring by the policy of conservative government who for example take the vehicle excise duty pay by london resident and spend it elsewhere in the country and by the fact that london be the only city of its size and scale that have public transport system that rely entirely on fare and charge for its income the mayor of london be show leadership where he can but he be entirely constrain by conservative government who do not care about the lung health of londoners absolutely agree my hon friend be right that fair amount of the vehicle excise duty be not be spend in london despite be hamstring in many way the mayor of london have be world lead he be go around the world to talk about the action he be take on clean air what we really need be the mayor of london be able to pull in the same direction as the government we need national strategy that go as far and as fast on clean air as the mayor have do in london that be why it would be good if there be not only labour mayor but london government because they would be able to work hand in hand to achieve that that would be good for all of we wherever we go and not just in london but across the country the hon lady criticise the funding in answer to her hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes but surely she be aware that the department for transport have give billion in funding to the mayor of london that be not insignificant by any stretch thank the minister for raise that but that be not equivalent to the amount actually raise by londoners and that go to the rest of the country which we understand but that should be factor when talk about how the ulez money for example be pay far to the minister point there be the concern about those area outside ulez that do not receive the same amount of funding they be represent by their local representative who should have strategy for respond to ulez be expand to those area of london as well the putney society in my constituency be local amenity group of fantastic local people they have choose to concentrate on clean air because it be one of the issue of most concern as result of concern over the level of atmospheric pollution in putney especially on the high street the society have carry out series of citizen science exercise over the past year or so to measure the level of nitrogen dioxide those have be one off exercise measure pollution for month at time with the generous help and support of the local environmental health team they have be able to mount series of monthly test enable they to see what the level look like in the long term the high level they find be not surprisingly at the northern end of putney high street where it be microgram and microgram per cubic metre of air in putney bridge road it be almost as high at microgram putney cross and upper richmond road be both in the to put those result in context we need to bear in mind that although the agree statutory maximum level be microgram per cubic metre of air that be essentially an interim target level whereas the agree world health organisation safe level be microgram per cubic metre consequently the level that putney society record be still disturbingly high go into that detail because do not think the high level we have on our london road be properly acknowledge in the bill rein back the good result of ulez to small area would mean leave those large area outside the south circular which cut through my constituency and people in the whole of that area with those high level of air pollution that be simply not acceptable support the implementation of ulez because we have public health emergency be concern about the impact on the health of child and vulnerable adult so action be need do not want to die early and do not want any of my constituent to die early but that be what be happen the exist ulez have be prove to change behaviour and we need that change in behaviour to clean our air so that more londoners will benefit welcome the extension of the scrappage scheme which happen after consultation for low income and disabled londoners and for charity to have their minibus exempt welcome the additional time give to charity and small business to comply with ulez support and wish to see in the bill no more bus route reduction improvement in public transport and green bus welcome investment in well public service as result of the fine charge by ulez and the introduction of the superloop we also need to invest in more safe cycle route safe cycle storage and local cycle delivery bike we be proud in putney to have an bike delivery scheme for our local business which pick up waste and get rid of it we also have more local bus delivery route available we need to make clear what be be fund by the ulez fund so that londoner see the benefit of investment in local service and cycle provision as well as know that the air be healthy and that their life will be healthy have be inspire by parent campaign for change include mums for lungs which be base locally and rosamund adoo kissi debrah the mother of ella kissi debrah who die of asthma year ago if have daughter die in such tragic circumstance do not know what would have do but she have be so brave courageous and inspirational in find out and expose the reason for ella death the high level of pollution and in take so much action to counter that issue also thank the putney society putney pollution busters the london sustainability exchange king college london clean air in london and the healthy air coalition for all the work that they do expose pollution and take action together for local people this be huge issue for people across my constituency and across london we can not start to meet clean air target without ulez people in outer london be disproportionately affect as more old people live in outer london recent analysis by asthma and lung uk have show that the uk have the bad death rate for lung condition in western europe surely that demand urgent action not rein in our action toxic air be also shorten life every year people in the uk die premature death as result of toxic air and of they be in london we can see that we need action in london but we also need it across the country let we look at outer london in dartford for example the equivalent of death year be attributable to long term exposure to particulate air pollution this be not just an inner london issue we need ulez expansion to the outer london borough air pollution be kill we and child be particularly vulnerable but poor community and black asian and minority ethnic community be the worst affected eleven londoners day die prematurely because of air pollution in wandsworth my constituent borough death every year be attributable to the effect of toxic air before the ulez expansion which the bill would undo only small part of my constituency be cover by the ultra low emission zone because the south circular cut through my constituency my constituent face postcode lottery with only those on one side of the road cover by the clean air zone why should only some of my constituent who live on the right side of an arbitrary boundary be able to breathe clean air it be far well to have large area cover that be much more consistent with where the polluted air be if we sit back and do nothing to reduce air pollution about londoner will develop disease have talk about the impact on small business it be an issue that have raise with small business on putney high street who have say that the dirty air be hold back their business we want hammersmith bridge reopen can not resist say that and will do so whenever can but we also need the continuation of the ulez report commission by the clean air fund conclude that improve air quality could bring an annual boost of billion to the uk economy through million additional working day and reduction in early retirement the evidence show we that ulez work and that it have be hugely successful with million more people expect to breathe clean air end with the word of constituent doctor who write to and say this bill will send the capital backwards and be counter to the devolutionary system of our politic just as we be begin to see the benefit of ulez be dismay that this private member bill will make already poor air quality bad harm londoners health particularly that of child to make matter bad the bill take the important decision about the air we breathe away from we as londoners and undermine our democratically elect mayor who be accountable to we and will shortly be test in the may election that be where such decision should be make urge all hon member to put our health first to support mayor sadiq khan action to clean up our air and to oppose the bill be disappointed that the opposition be use all the available time to try to talk the bill out but be not go to play that game will keep my speech short back the bill on behalf of all the hard work people of watford who have to go into london to do their job those who work at the hospital and all the entertainer and musician it have be good to be in the chamber to discuss the bill have listen intently to member on both side of the debate must begin by emphasise that labour front benchers do not support the bill as must be obvious and reject it in its entirety there be number of reason for that but shall focus on the two main reason first the bill represent nothing other than poor attempt at political point scoring from government who be run out of idea and ironically run out of road as for the second reason you may be wonder mr deputy speaker why welsh member be speak out on bill relate to greater london be proud unionist believe in our union but be also proud to represent devolved nation believe wholeheartedly in devolution and the benefit that it bring to the united kingdom and that be why have feel so compel to speak out today in my view the most worrying aspect of the bill be the fact that it represent yet another order just want to clarify that the hon lady be speak not in an official capacity but on behalf of her constituent yes absolutely be speak on behalf of all the people in pontypridd as be say the bill represent yet another devastating attack on devolution this government repeatedly attack devolution the united kingdom internal market act ride roughshod over the devolved government and the bill seem to do the same it also attack the ability of the democratically elect mayor of london to meet legally bind air pollution target let explain my first point in more detail the uk government approach to clean air zone have be completely inconsistent they clearly do not feel strongly about this issue they view this as an opportunity to politicise deeply important issue with life threaten implication an issue that should have cross party support and one about which the vast majority of the united kingdom feel strongly be refer of course to our environment our environmental commitment and the health and safety of all our citizen this be either an instance of the government turn their back on those vital matter or pure political point scoring which be it perhaps it be both let highlight the hypocrisy of this government in case have not be clear enough so far they have require and indeed encourage the introduction of many other clean air zone across the country they have support and continue to support those zone and provide cash for scrappage in bristol bath sheffield birmingham portsmouth and other area give that they have encourage and require the introduction of clean air zone across the country why not in london why be london the outlier of course labour member know exactly why they also understand that improve and invest in other area of transport might remove the need for clean air zone for example invest in our public transport and ensure well more reliable and more affordable service would reduce the number of people on the road there be other way to help we reach our environmental goal and labour know that the bill be not the answer labour be completely committed to protect our environment and tackle the climate crisis to give our child the future and opportunity that they deserve labour government would decarbonise the economy and ensure that we all have safe air to breathe if the government will not listen to the overwhelming evidence and the environmental fact if that be not enough for they to understand all this they must at least attempt to empathise with the health case because let we be clear toxic air pollution be public health crisis air pollution be link to about premature death year in london as we have hear repeatedly this afternoon it lead to child grow up with stunt lung and be link to the development of disease range from asthma to heart disease and dementia surely that alone be enough reason to support clean air zone as for the practicality the vast majority of london in every car see drive in greater london be now ulez compliant if the public understand the importance of our environmental commitment and be willing to comply with the scheme why be the government try to change it now what possible motive could they have for do so labour welcome the decision of transport for london and the mayor of london to expand the scrappage scheme since august every londoner with non compliant vehicle have be eligible for grant to replace their vehicle although central government provide no financial support to the mayor of london it be important that tackle air pollution do not place an undue burden on those already struggle with the tory cost of living crisis family endure that crisis be sick with anxiety and their local service be under immense pressure see that in my community and hear directly from my constituent about the devastating hardship that the tory cost of living crisis continue to place on they and their family whether it be because of mortgage payment go up the cost of food fuel and energy price continue to rise or be unable to afford that much long for family holiday all those thing be push family to the brink let we be frank we know where the blame firmly lie the debate stand adjourn standing order no order that the debate be resume on friday

redevelopment motion make and question propose that this house do now harris it be pleasure to see you in the chair mr deputy speaker thank the minister for her attendance and thank mr speaker for grant permission to hold this special debate this be my special parliamentary debate on kettering general hospital since may seven of those debate have be since september so the house be familiar with the subject the reason keep apply for debate on kettering general hospital be that the redevelopment of the hospital be the no local priority for all resident in kettering and for as the local member of parliament our hospital be much love local institution it have be in the town of kettering since the year of queen victoria diamond jubilee in that be great year for kettering as not only be the hospital establish but so be the much love newspaper the northamptonshire evening telegraph and here we be year on with an extremely exciting programme of massive investment go into the hospital it be really important issue for kettering which be why keep up the pressure on the government to ensure that the redevelopment programme be deliver and succeed as the local member of parliament be pleased that kettering general hospital place in the national new hospital programme have be secure that programme will see more than hospital redevelop across the country for kgh it mean million of capital investment with fully fund improve and expand hospital on the same site this be the big ever capital investment in kgh in its year history initial enable work have already start and the project be due for completion in just six year by all of we who live locally know how important kgh be to everyone who live in the area as the local mp have make it my main priority to make the case for this million of extra investment by we should have an improve and expand hospital on the same site the big ever new investment in our local hospital and probably the big ever capital investment in kettering itself it will be of huge benefit to local people for many year to come may start by acknowledge the government commitment to the hospital this pledge represent massive amount of money on top of the million the government also effectively inject million into the hospital by write off its entire debt in the path to the million project have be complicated and tortuous it start with pledge of million make in to redevelop the into an urgent care hub on the site in the same year million be pledge for the hospital rebuild the combined total be million but we have now secure million and climbing so the investment be get big and the ambition be get great the pledge be no long to replace the with an urgent care hub but to redevelop the entire hospital that be hugely welcome and very significant for the local area we need this investment because kettering and north northamptonshire be among the fast grow place in the whole country the hospital serve the population of north northamptonshire and south leicestershire where the growth in the local population have be almost double the national average over recent year the late office for national statistics datum estimate above average percentage population growth of up to over the next year corby which be next door to kettering have the country high birth rate the hospital expect increase in the number of in the local area in the next five to year the area as whole be commit to at least new house over the next decade and the local population in north northamptonshire be set to rise by some to over people the accident and emergency unit already see more than patient every single day in department that be sized to safely see only so the pressure on it be acute basically the be full it be first construct in year ago to cope with just attendance each year but attendance be expect by seventy per cent of the building on the main site be more than year old and there be maintenance backlog of more than million sixty per cent of the hospital estate be rat either poor or bad and local people all know that investment in our local hospital be badly need with credit to the government they have rightly accept that which be why kgh be part of the new hospital programme the plan to rebuild kettering general hospital be on track and be progress fast than many similar scheme across the country the plan be to rebuild kgh on the same site move the main service into two new six storey building locate next door to each other the government have allocate over million to fund these work include up to million for the new urgent care hub to replace the and just under million for the new power plant to power the new hospital the inspirational director of strategy at kettering general hospital polly grimmett recently tell north northamptonshire council health and scrutiny committee in january that the proposal for the new hospital to remain on the same site make progress lot simple and lot easy than other scheme she say when you look at some of the other scheme across the uk that be actually ahead of we initially they slow down and we speed up because they have be stick in public consultation for quite some time the difference with kettering be that it have local development consent order to do the work it own the land there be not the same problem that other site be experience polly go on to say that it scheme that fairly simple will get stick in the mire and can progress well she say that kgh have move to be near the front of other hospital build in the running the first step in the redevelopment will see the new power plant be build on the site this will replace the temporary steam boiler put in as temporary solution year ago which currently sit on flatbe lorry platform in the hospital car park and can regularly be see sneeze and splutter as they power the hospital they be in urgent need of replacement which be what the new energy centre will do the first of the six storey hospital building in the main scheme will be build in car park in the centre of the site with some staff parking sadly be lose temporarily during that time and nearby nhs office space will be demolish once build be operational the second phase can begin which will include the new main entrance face rothwell road the main work on the main building can be expect to start in an important part of the scheme be to keep the hospital run during the construction period the first part of the scheme will be the energy plant to power the expand hospital that really be the main focus of my remark in the debate today the preparatory work on the hospital be under way but seek confirmation that we can expect spade in the ground to start the building of the energy plant sometime this summer hope the minister can give that reassurance to and local resident who be keen to see work actually start on the site the redevelopment of the hospital have be make more urgent by the discovery in february of reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete in the maternity wing know that where some of the other hospital of the in the new hospital programme have discover raac their investment profile have be speed up very sadly kettering now also have raac not to anything like the same extent as some other hospital but it be badly affect the maternity and gynaecology wing raac have be find in the roof where the maternity block be currently house it have be deem unsafe and the entire top floor have therefore be lose it be also know from previous building assessment that the building contain asbestos and be deem unsuitable for long term repair as such could the minister provide with some reassurance that the investment profile for the rebuild can be speed up due to the discovery of raac that be an additional factor that be not realise when the original approval be give my understanding which would like the minister to kindly confirm be that ground investigation work be currently under way and be likely to be complete by the end of this month think we can expect site hoarding and site office to be erect next month which will have some impact on parking on site that some temporary generator be likely to be instal in may and that drainage diversion will also be start if the minister could give some assurance that in the summer we can expect start to the construction of the energy power plant itself that would be appreciate also understand that there be to be high voltage infrastructure work basically cable be lay from the field street substation under the railway bridge to the hospital because of the extra power requirement that the hospital will have the business case approval process for all the hospital in these scheme be tortuous there be three stage that have to be go through and each stage take at least three month for approval by the new hospital programme team and nhs england can have some reassurance from the minister that if the hospital get its final business case in which be due in june it could be turn around in fortnight rather than three month so that we can get the fund in place and the building under way can also have some reassurance that not only the approval process from the new hospital programme team but the approval process from nhs england will be expedite lot of box have to be tick for the fund to flow and resident be really keen to see the work under way be grateful to you mr deputy speaker for be in the chair and to mr speaker for allow to hold this debate in closing simply ask the minister whether she would be kind enough to facilitate meeting for with the hospitals minister the noble lord markham who have previously be kind enough to visit the hospital so that can discuss with he the detail of the work that will be take place over the next few week and month congratulate my hon friend the member for kettering mr hollobone on secure this important debate he tirelessly campaign for kettering particularly for the new hospital
