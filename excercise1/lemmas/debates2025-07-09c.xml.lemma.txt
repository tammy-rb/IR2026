cumbernauld fire station which sadly be just one example of the snp dangerous mismanagement of scotland fire service as the fire brigades union in scotland tell just last month there be billion reason why the snp government should choose to invest in local service include in cumbernauld but after year of failure and neglect my hon friend constituent will rightly not hold out much hope across scotland we need new direction next may with anas sarwar as the first minister do the secretary of state share my view that whatever the snp scottish government budget they have cynically and systematically deprive funding from area that do not support independence leave council such as dumfries and galloway and scottish borders and their health board struggle to provide basic service would extend that and say that the whole of scotland vote against independence in it seem to that the snp government strategy be to starve all scotland public service of the vital funding that they require the spending review come off the back of last year autumn budget which hit business in my constituency in north east scotland very hard whether it be family business and farm with the change to agricultural property relief and business property relief or the extension of and increase in the energy profit levy hit investment in our vital oil and gas sector what conversation be the secretary of state have actively with the treasury to ensure that north east scotland do not have to pay the price for this government decision again next year have have minimum of billion

this morning as he know scottish liberal democrats secure funding for key project across scotland in last year scottish budget negotiation include the eye pavilion in edinburgh which be so important for my constituent and his we welcome the additional funding as part of the spending review to help project such as that but almost two decade of snp mismanagement have leave our health service in dire need of investment and improvement do he agree that the snp should invest this funding wisely in gps dentist and care so that our constituent can see the same focus on innovation in health that be announce by the uk government last week the hon lady make good point about the eye pavilion in edinburgh which be symptom of the whole of the scottish government strategy for our nhs service the

have any idea how to fix it it would have do it by now during the spending review period the scottish government will have to continue to mitigate some of the cruell westminster policy they have to do that under the tories and it continue under labour not least with the two child cap can the secretary of state tell we whether there be any plan to scrap it the hon gentleman and his colleague vote against the budget they vote against all the measure to raise revenue in the budget and they vote against the actual spending of it from the second that this labour government take power just over year ago there be billion extra go into the scottish budget the scottish government need to be spend it well and be sure the scottish public will look dimly on scottish government who can not spend it and improve our public service be not sure the secretary of state quite catch the question there we vote against the two child cap if there be cash to go around and uk departments be get big spending increase than the scottish government why will he not prioritise child poverty the child poverty action group describe get rid of the two child cap as the most cost effective way to cut child poverty it be describe by the pensions minister as immoral the cabinet office recent report tackling child poverty state there be lot we can learn from action already be take in scotland wales and northern ireland will the secretary of state make scrap the two child poverty cap priority or will he insist on fail tory policy go by the vote last week the hon gentleman want to keep the fail broken welfare system that the tories put in what we have do as government be pay rise for scot day one right for sick leave and parental leave and off energy bill for more than half million scottish household and

be at the cutting edge of compute power globally it be refreshing to have uk government so commit to invest in and develop ai in comparison with john swinney and the scottish government who be stick in an analogue age unable even to provide patient and staff with function nhs app do the minister agree that the town of airdrie and shotts and the former industrial heartland of north lanarkshire be incredibly well place to serve as an ai growth zone and capture the government clear ambition much like my hon friend who be truly passionate advocate for his community be proud to represent one of

my hon friend for make the case for his constituent know the health secretary will give it every consideration the year plan will establish neighbourhood health centre in every community and will make massive difference start in the place where the need be great and life expectancy be at its low be proud that we promise million extra nhs appointment in the first year of labour government and we have now deliver million we should not forget that the record investment in the budget which make that possible be oppose by all the opposition party call the leader of the opposition echo the prime minister sentiment about the horrific terrorist attack of july be pleased to be at the commemoration service on monday in particular our thought be with the family of those who lose their life those who have to go on without their love one would like to pay tribute to lord tebbit who die yesterday at the age of he be man of iron integrity and conviction who by his effort help to save our country from the chaos of the we all owe he so much in its manifesto last year labour promise not to increase income tax not to increase national insurance and not to increase vat do the prime minister still stand by his promise yes it be it be rare that the prime minister be able to give clear answer but be glad that he have do so now he also promise in fact he boast that he have solve the doctor strike only prime minister who be so weak would give doctor pay rise only for we now to see they vote to strike again he fold in every negotiation and claim it be triumph interruption yes he do we see more promise at the budget the chancellor promise that she would lift the freeze on income tax and national insurance threshold because in her word they hurt work people be that still government policy no prime minister or chancellor be go to write budget in advance we be absolutely fix on our fiscal rule we remain committed to they we remain committed to our manifesto commitment realise that stick to fiscal rule and manifesto commitment be bit unfamiliar to the conservatives it be because of the decision the chancellor and this government have take that we can update the house billion of inward investment into this country since we take office business confidence at nine year high long than the leader of the opposition have be in parliament deloitte this week say that the uk be now the good place to invest create job what contrast to the mess we inherit from the conservative party there be no clear answer there the whole house will have hear the prime minister fail to rule out freeze tax threshold he could say yes to the first question he could promise but could not this time what do this mean he be talk about record investment and more job we know that people be lose their job unemployment have go up every single month of labour year in office what do the issue of tax threshold mean it mean that under labour million of our poor pensioner face be drag into income tax for the first time ever do the prime minister think it be right that struggle pensioner should face retirement tax for prime minister or chancellor to say we be not go to write budget in advance be not labour thing or tory thing every single prime minister and chancellor say that they will not do that we will stick to our manifesto commitment we will stick to our fiscal rule this be language the conservatives do not understand and that be what get we into the problem in the first place the leader of the opposition come here every week to talk the country down but that record billion will mean good well pay job across the country this investment be from foreign investor who can choose whether to invest in this country they be choose to invest in this country now because they have confidence in what this government be do investor be flee the country the prime minister say he will stick to his manifesto promise but labour promise not to put tax on work people and then we get the job tax and all we have see be job disappear before the election the prime minister promise not penny more on your council tax the institute for fiscal studies say that council tax bill will now rise at their fast rate in year will the prime minister admit that under he council tax be set to soar no of course it be not it soar under the last government here she go again the leader of the opposition be back on familiar territory she come here every week complain about the national insurance rise and when she be ask whether she would have the courage to reverse it what be her answer hon member no no and will tell you for why mr speaker she be too embarrassed to say that she do not want the investment that we have put in that investment go into the nhs the conservatives want that investment but they can not say how they would pay for it that be what get we into the problem in the first place the prime minister still do not understand so be go to make it very simple for he this be mess of his own making he should not be ask how we would clean it up the fact be this government raise national insurance through the job tax and that be why they have to put up council tax the truth be that his catastrophic budget have create domino effect that he can not now control we on the conservative benches know that you can not tax your way to growth but now he be labour member be all mutter but remember that budget they be laugh and cheer they have no idea of the mess that they be create they should go and explain to their constituent why unemployment be go up what be more worrying be that now the prime minister be flirt with neil kinnock demand for wealth tax let we be honest about what that mean it would be tax on all our constituent saving on their house and on their pension it would be tax on aspiration will the prime minister rule this out the right hon lady say that we should not be ask they for advice on the economy she be absolutely right about that we will not be ask for their advice what we do in the budget be stabilise the economy through the measure take by the chancellor what have that lead to four interest rate cut for mortgage holder that be hugely important compare and contrast that with what happen under the liz truss mini budget we have the fast growth in the in the first quarter of this year wage be up more in the first month of labour government than in the year under the tories so no we do not need lesson from they the prime minister say that he have stabilise the economy have he speak to any farmer recently it be time for he to take responsibility for the mess that he be make he have be in office for year and all we see be he congratulate himself on what fantastic job he have do interruption nobody out there believe it not even labour members what weak cheer he be congratulate himself but we can compare record he talk about the fast grow economy we leave he the fast grow economy of the we cut the deficit in every year until the pandemic and we get inflation down to on his watch taxis be up unemployment be up inflation be up and this weak prime minister have be force into series of chaotic turn yesterday the office for budget responsibility say that our economy be be erode under labour doctor strike tax bombshell the wealthy leave in drove be it not the truth that under he he be drag we back to the we be responsible for million extra appointment in the nhs we be responsible for year plan on the future of the nhs after the conservatives break it we be also responsible for free school meal be roll out in way that have never be do by anybody breakfast club be roll out family hub be roll out transport across the country and migration come down we take responsibility and we be proud of that the eden project in cornwall be proven success story inject million into the local economy in lancashire eden project morecambe will soon be under construction and be set to create hundred of job it be about time that we have the third instalment with memo portland or eden portland as many like to call it that will be world class attraction celebrate the jurassic coast and transform the economy in south dorset will the prime minister back this exciting project and work with and all relevant minister to secure funding to deliver it and ideally can we use the new growth mission fund thank my hon friend for highlight that exciting proposal he be fantastic advocate for portland and south dorset eden portland be hugely exciting project can not confirm funding allocation yet but our million growth mission fund should support transformative project that give local leader real investment to deliver real change he make compelling case in relation to the fund call the leader of the liberal democrats may associate myself and my party with the prime minister comment about the horrifying terrorist bombing of here in london our thought be with the victim their family and our emergency service may also join in send condolence to the family of lord tebbit he be man of service in the raf in politic and as carer for his wife margaret he will be greatly miss after year of conservative neglect the special educational need system be in desperate need of repair but with parent understandably worried we already hear labour mps plan another rebellion so may make this offer to the prime minister if he genuinely want to fix the problem and not strip away the right of child and parent in some cost cut exercise we have vote to help will the prime minister look at the five test for send reform that we have publish today and work with we to make it happen it be tell that when the right hon gentleman ask about the broken send system the tory back benchers laugh that be how seriously they take their responsibility it be an absolute shame as the right hon gentleman know every week in this house members raise the issue with think it have be raise with more time than anything else everyone know that the send system be break guess who break it along with everything else the system do not work for parent and it let down child so we need to reform and change it it be not about save money we have already invest an additional billion in send it be about create new system that truly support every child we be develop proposal and we want to work with parent and teacher to get this right would expect the right hon gentleman to welcome that thank the prime minister for his reply we want to work across the house to fix the mess that the tories leave but we do not want another welfare style mess this time we have to fix the system properly for parent and child the conservative government badly undermine the security of our border by rip up the return agreement that allow we to send migrant back to europe hope that the prime minister can secure new return agreement with france that act as real deterrent and stop the boat the conservatives also send hundred of million of pound to france and get nothing in return do the prime minister agree that any new funding to the french government must be conditional on they agree return deal and do their bit to stop the boat we be work closely with the french on this issue we will only provide funding that deliver on our priority we be work together closely and we share information to much great extent than be the case before we have new specialist intelligence unit at dunkirk and we be the first government to persuade the french to review their law and tactic on the north coast in order to take more effective action will be discuss this at meeting with president macron today and tomorrow in the light of recent event will the prime minister update the house on the work of the covid corruption commissioner do he agree with my constituent in rugby bulkington and the surround village that there should be no place in public life for people who exploit the pandemic and defraud the taxpayer to line their own pocket my hon friend make powerful point and hope it be hear by those on the conservative benches it be an absolute scandal that fail personal protective equipment contract be hand out by the conservatives cost taxpayer billion we be focus on get our money back can confirm that the commissioner be now investigate fraud involve bounce back and business support loan and we will continue to go after the fraudster grifter and con artist no matter who they be or where we find they the main order some of you want to get in later if this take forever you will not get in the main reason why that this country wisely vote for brexit back in include million of labour supporter be that we want to take back control of our border so that we alone decide who come and settle in our country do the prime minister understand that this demand be even great today than it be back in and that we demand the country do the prime minister understand that the country demand that he say to the french president that we will not accept undocumented male come across the english channel and that he be not dictate to by an increasingly arrogant anti brexit french president we be fix the mess that we inherit and we be work with other country to ensure that we take the measure necessary to stop people cross the channel they be serious answer to serious problem for year the hon member proposal the tail wag the tory dog have be to break everything and claim that it be how you fix thing and to stick two finger up at our neighbour and then expect they to work with we he vote against the border bill which give more power to our law enforcement to deal with security at our border the reason for that be that he have no interest in fix the problem he want to milk it and exploit it that be the truth about he and his party from homelessness to child poverty so many of the challenge see people face in exeter can be trace back to early year so welcome the government rebuild on the legacy of sure start which be so cruelly dismantle by the conservative party will the prime minister set out what difference that will make to family service in exeter be grateful to my hon friend we have discuss this before he

thing that get we into the problem in the first place we can not just tax our way to growth we need to ensure that we put in place the necessary measure we be put in place plan reform to drive growth the hon member vote against that and the opposition vote against that be proud that the labour government be ban fire and rehire be proud that we be address the abusive use of zero hour contract and improve protection at work particularly against unfair dismissal reform and its tory friend vote against labour workplace protection do not know why tory members be heckle when they be in government they promise to deal with fire and rehire but despite the scandal at they do absolutely nothing about it do my right hon and learn friend agree that it be only this labour government who will ensure that people have fairness at work be proud that we will give million worker half of all worker strong right at work we be ensure sick pay for up to million of the low pay tackle sexual harassment and

the way through it we in reform uk do not subscribe to that sort of dog whistle politic will you please advise we mr speaker of how to stop this behaviour in the future think mr farage be capable of deal with his own battle as we have see on many occasion would say that this be about the respect and tolerance that we should show each other what we do in here be reflect outside so please let we show common sense and respect for each other on point of order mr speaker at prime minister question the prime minister claim in response to my question that the green party have make unfunded spending commitment in our general election manifesto he also say that to at last week prime minister question that be clearly untrue our manifesto be fully cost include through proposal for the wealth tax that be call for will you outline mr speaker how might correct the record should send copy of our manifesto to the prime minister will not continue the debate from prime minister question which have end the hon gentleman have correct the record with what he have state which be now on the record trial by jury propose restrictions urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if she will make statement on her plan to restrict trial by jury through the creation of crown court bench division and related sentencing change this government inherit justice system in crisis with record and rise backlog in our criminal court leave victim in limbo as they wait to see justice do for that reason the lord chancellor commission sir brian leveson to undertake once in generation review of the criminal court we be grateful to sir brian for all his work his report confirm that the system we inherit be break and that if we do nothing it will collapse we welcome the ambitious recommendation that he have put forward and agree that crisis of this scale require bold action we must consider any measure that will put our court on more stable and sustainable footing victim and the public deserve swift justice and court system that they can have confidence in we will carefully consider sir brian recommendation on jury trial along with everything else before provide formal response to parliament in the autumn jury trial be and will remain cornerstone of british justice and will remain in place for the most serious case however justice delay be justice deny the system be not design for scenario where ten of thousand of victim wait year for justice the lord chancellor and this government be commit to turn the tide on the crown court backlog by the end of this parliament and create sustainable justice system fit for the century all of we agree that justice delay be justice deny that be why it be so important to get control of the court backlog no one pretend that this be straightforward but the government have make the crisis bad the backlog be at record high and accelerate with case be add every month sir brian leveson review rightly acknowledge that we must increase the number of court sitting day we thank he for his work and welcome many of his recommendation however it can not be right to give another sentencing discount to those convict of crime such as burglary and stalking that could see criminal serve as little as fifth of their sentence when combine with the gauke of sentence serve be that justice for victim out of court settlement for drug dealer and thief mean that they will not even get criminal record it make mockery of the justice system just as concern be the proposal to scrap jury trial in many case the report admit that this will have only limited effect on the backlog it will save just of the department budget as the report state there be no limit to the case for which jury trial could be scrap this be slippery slope towards abolish jury trial altogether jury trial have be central part of our constitution for century in magna carta and indeed before it they be gift that we have give to the world to throw they away so casually show total disregard for our constitution and for such limited benefit it seem that too many on the government benches want to scrap jury trial regardless of the backlog because they do not trust the british public instinct on justice they say that judge know well we say that the public know well it do not have to be this way the government must take up the lady chief justice offer of more sitting day will the minister rule out yet another sentencing cut for criminal will she rule out let drug dealer and thief avoid even criminal record do she accept that scrap jury trial be disgraceful and unnecessary rejection of one of our country proud and most ancient liberty what do not hear in any of that be an apology it be extraordinary to hear that the shadow justice secretary have suddenly discover sense of urgency but where be that sense of urgency in the past year the so call party of law of order allow two thing to happen first it take our prison system to the brink of collapse that let down the public and it let down victim soft on crime and soft on law and order secondly it allow the backlog in our crown court to run out of control to record high for year the conservatives do absolutely nothing so let explain the contrast with party and government who be grip the crisis and who be tough on law and order we commission one of their own sir david gauke to give we his sentencing review we commission one of our most revere judge sir brian leveson who today have set out his recommendation we will not provide our policy response today because that demand and require seriousness not what we hear from the shadow justice secretary but serious careful analysis and we will provide our formal response to the house in the autumn but we be not delay we be not wait we be invest in the system to take up the challenge from the right hon gentleman about what the lady chief justice say we have already do what the previous government fail to do with an additional crown court sit day and record level of sit day year up from what the so call party of law and order give we we also understand that we need proper system capacity as we hear from the lord chancellor yesterday this be not simply about add more crown court sitting day as sir brian leveson tell we have the right hon gentleman bother to read the report we can not simply sit our way out of this crisis we have to build system capacity more judge more prosecutor more defence lawyer and more court usher of course we need to invest in the system which be what the government be do with promise of million into our court additional to what the conservative party provide we be stay laser focus on our mission which be to provide swifter justice for victim and restore public confidence in justice system that be leave to rack and ruin by the conservative party the right hon gentleman have jump the gun we have be very clear that we be go to consider sir brian careful and detailed report and we be go to listen to those who represent victim and to the barrister and judge who do such an exceptional job we will do what it take for the victim who if she report rape or serious crime be tell that she will have to wait until or in some case for her day in court that be unacceptable and that be why we will do whatever it take with the seriousness that the previous government simply fail to have call the chair of the justice committee what sir brian comprehensive report demonstrate be the terrible state that our once envy criminal justice system be leave in by the shadow lord chancellor and his colleague do my hon and learn friend agree with sir brian that dig ourselves out of the hole in which they leave we will require more investment great efficiency and structural change be that the debt that we owe to victim of crime in particular to ensure that they get justice it be up to this government to put right the wrong that have be do over the past year as ever my hon friend the chair of the justice committee give consider response and he be absolutely right there need to be recognition of the scale of the problem and two thing be require investment and reform when hon member read the report they will see that sir brian be very clear that we need investment this government be already begin to make that investment through the additional crown court sit day that we have lay on this year run the system at system max additional funding for legal aid lawyer and criminal legal aid and million to keep the sector go on both the defence and the prosecutorial side we be make that investment but critically as sir brian make absolutely clear that alone will not be report september vol correction we need to consider once in generation structural reform that will run sustainable proportionate system that will allow we to deliver swifter justice for victim investment and reform that be what we will be get on with and that be what we will report on in the autumn the minister will know the high regard in which hold she with that in mind do she in her own heart believe that intermediate court will fix the criminal court backlog or do she agree with the legal profession that that risk be costly distraction from invest in the exist system do she agree with that chip away jury trial in the name of speed risk undermine the cornerstone of british justice as say in my opening response jury trial will remain cornerstone for british justice for the most serious case but as sir brian levenson evidence in his careful report juryless trial can be swifter trial to put that into context of criminal trial in this country be currently hear without jury that be how our criminal justice system currently function of course it be right that we listen to those who participate in the system whether they be prosecute or defend those in the system but it be also right that we listen to the voice who have welcome today report the head of the met police former lord chancellors former lord chief justice and the victims commissioner their voice matter too just as sir brian have do we need to consider package of measure capable of alleviate the acute crisis in which we find ourselves do my hon and learn friend agree that trial by jury be and will always remain fundamental concept of our british justice system but we also need to ensure that we restore victim faith in the system and do what we can to ensure justice be not deny by justice be delay my hon friend be absolutely right the shadow secretary of state for justice quote magna carta but the state obligation be to ensure fair trial and essential to fair trial be timely justice in circumstance where some victim of crime be wait two or three year for their day in court that be not fair in fact that be result in many victim pull out of trial render court time waste and retraumatise those victim what the shadow secretary of state for justice have not read be the entirety of magna carta quote to no one will we delay right or justice the right to timely trial be embed in magna carta and we need to get back to deliver it call the liberal democrat spokesperson in his urgent question the shadow secretary of state for justice say that the public know good for once agree with he which be why the public throw out the last conservative government after they crash our criminal justice system yesterday make the case for safeguard the guarantor of our justice system our jury trial however today on behalf of the liberal democrats want to raise our concern that reclassify certain offence and draw on magistrate to run the new intermediate court risk put unbearable strain on the magistrate court jeopardise their ability to deliver swift justice especially for survivor of domestic abuse crime before adopt any new proposal will the minister publish an impact assessment of the measure on victim in magistrate court and will she rule out any measure that will delay justice safety or freedom for survivor of domestic abuse the proposal for the reclassification of certain offence in sir brian report be just that it be sir brian recommendation as have say already we need to take those recommendation away and consider whether they be appropriate for our justice system the hon gentleman be right to highlight the essential role that the magistrate play in our criminal justice system currently some of criminal trial be hear in our magistrate court and they do phenomenal job that be why we be continue to recruit magistrate annually and we want more diverse magistracy all of that will be essential he be right that these proposal which sir brian have convey as package need to interlock and to be operable together so we be take the summer to engage with stakeholder such as the magistrates association to ensure that we get this right with the crown court backlog that we inherit at such high level and continue to rise do the minister agree that tackle it mean not just add more sit day but make fundamental reform the crisis that we inherit in our criminal court with record and rise backlog be intolerable the human impact of that on people whether they be victim witness or they serve in the criminal justice system be simply intolerable if we do nothing as the conservative party be all too willing to do the system will in the word of one of its own former lord chancellor alex chalk become irrecoverable it be not enough to sit our way out of this crisis we must have radical structural reform as well that be the abide lesson of sir brian report and we will take it on board we should thank sir brian for his report and carefully consider his recommendation criminal already get one third discount for an early guilty plea and the idea that that should be increase to risk undermine trust in the criminal justice system by victim jury trial be century old cornerstone of the british justice system the creation of an intermediate court to save million be not worth it when we have empty courtroom and judge available and ready to sit we need to build capacity and make the jury system work agree with the hon gentleman that we all owe debt of gratitude to sir brian leveson and his team for the comprehensive review that they have undertake to which the government will be give due consideration over the summer before we formally provide our response we have to ensure that whatever package of proposal we take forward knit together with the recommendation from the gauke review and the outcome of the spending review that the ministry of justice have receive with commitment to make an additional investment of million in our court want to address his point about intermediate court they be not about save money but about address the backlog deliver swifter justice for victim and have criminal justice system in which the public can have confidence if this package of idea be right and will achieve that aim we will pursue it spend the first year of my professional life in the criminal court as barrister there be no one who love the criminal justice system or who have more respect for jury than do however the court now be not what they be the delay be so appalling that defendant just plead not guilty because they know that their case will not come up for year and the chance of actually face justice be minimal it be in that extreme state which we have inherit from the conservative government that radical action be need know that my hon friend on the government front bench feel as do about the criminal justice system and want it to work so when they be look at sir brian recommendation will they consider sunset clause if his recommendation work there will come time when we can increase the amount of jury service again my right hon friend speak with huge authority and personal experience of how our crown court operate like we she be commit to restore and rebuild our criminal justice system to what it once be and to system fit for the century that the public can have confidence in that mean adapt our method take on new technology and become more efficient all of that will come in the second part of sir brian review as we have ask he to do will not pre empty the response or give running commentary on it but all those thing will be take into account as we consider our response over the summer last year be on jury we all know that we need to get the court backlog down but my experience at reading crown court be that the availability of juror really be not an issue many of we sit there for hour upon hour and several juror be dismiss on the thursday have never set foot in courtroom before we restrict the number of jury trial what work have the government do to actually understand the utilisation of juror to see how many be be use and whether they could be use more effectively thank the hon gentleman and all those who perform the civic duty of participate in jury for their service as say that will remain cornerstone of british justice for the most serious case but that be not the issue the issue be that demand come into the system simply outstrip the rate at which the court be able to address and dispose of those case we need to look at the system capacity the amount of judicial time the number of prosecutor and defence lawyer and the availability of suitable court building usher and criminal legal aid we need all that system capacity and we need to get it work together to address the challenge that other have outline remind the hon gentleman that not only be of our criminal trial hear in magistrate court but it remain fact that magistrate court deliver turnaround of case on average four or five time fast than in crown court that be swift justice for victim and that be why we need to look at whole system reform my constituent have very simple view of the criminal justice system they want to know that the victim of crime will have their day in court and that the perpetrator will have punishment commensurate with the crime they commit that underpin their faith in the system so they come forward to report crime while the conservatives seek to talk down the justice system will the minister set out what she and her department be do to ensure that victim of crime feel confident enough to come forward to report crime hopeful that they will get the outcome they want my hon friend speak so passionately on behalf of his constituent think the public ask for something really simple if people be unfortunate enough to be the victim of crime they expect to have their day in court in timely fashion not to be make to wait for year only to find that the trial have become ineffective and be put off for yet another year that undermine faith in the system and that be what be so detrimental about the neglect and under investment under the conservatives that have be so corrosive of trust in the justice system it be not simply that we be not deliver swift justice for victim it be that the public risk lose faith in our justice system which to date have be one of the glory of this country do the minister agree that one of the bad feature of the us justice system be the extreme process of plea bargaining which give such huge differential if somebody plead guilty that it create perverse incentive to do so even if they be innocent but not confident that they will be acquit can she guarantee that we be not go down that route with discount for plead guilty couple with early release for other reason english common law and our commitment to the rule of law with our independent judiciary be part of what make this country great we be not go to ape the american system or indeed any other system we will look carefully at the recommendation of sir brian leveson report include in relation to the use of goodyear indication but we know that our law be robust provide that we have justice system that be up to the task of enforce that law that be what we be really focus on under the tories last year of rape victim drop out of their case because they be leave wait year for justice we finally have justice secretary who have put victim first and allocate the high number of sit day on record give all the outrage from the conservatives at the size of the backlog be really keen to know what they do will the minister answer what this labour government be do to get justice for victim quick my hon friend be absolutely right we talk about sit day and backlog and it can all sound little arid and academic but it come back to people the fact that so many victim of rape and serious sexual offence pull out of the process be testament to the fact that the system be not work that be the direct consequence of allow the backlog to run out of control we have to keep victim engage in the process which be why we have invest specifically in victim service and why we be look to strengthen the victim code ultimately victim want swift justice that be why we will take careful look at sir brian recommendation and do what it take to bring down the backlog magistrate court be already under significant stress some of trial do not go ahead on the day that they be list remove the right to choose jury trial for sentence of under two year under an intermediate court can not reverse year of underfunding the closure of local court and severe staff shortage from prosecutor to defence advocate the consultation on the reform of local justice area propose to merge three north wales bench against the advice of local magistrate do the minister recognise the risk of yet further disruption to justice in wales the right hon lady have describe how important the role of the magistrate court will be and the importance of whole system reform the government be not look to tweak one aspect to tweak what go on in the magistrate court or the crown court one of the genius of the magistrate court be the local link and the fact that it deliver local justice so we will look at that carefully but there be no get away from it the scale of the problem and what sir brian report tell we mean that we need whole system reform of the criminal justice system from begin to end thank the minister for her statement and for the recognition of the importance of magistrate court sadly harlow magistrate court be close by the previous government as be chorley magistrate court of course recently speak to police officer in my constituency who have be police officer for three year he be be ask to gather evidence to go to court for crime commit before he be even police officer be it any wonder that victim have lose confidence in the system this government need to ensure that we have fundamental reform to this process to ensure that people in my constituency get the justice they deserve and we can reopen the court in chorley they be available come back to the fact that this government be invest in our court estate we have invest an additional million in our court building for maintenance and to keep the show on the road but my hon friend be absolutely right the delay will reach tipping point if we choose to do nothing about they and that be simply not an option the obligation on the state be to deliver fair trial and timeliness be critical to that the long the wait the more likely it be that victim will pull out of the system and that the evidence become undermined because people memory fade that be why timeliness and get the delay down be so critical to the mission we have to pursue here we go again labour always talk tough on crime and always go soft the minister talk about david gauke as one of our own as if that be some defence assure she that probably have more in common with she than do with david gauke that be not good way to show off credential on be tough on crime have see at first hand where the court the police and the crown prosecution service work together to cut through all the bureaucracy and backlog to get tough on crime in lancashire organise crime gang member be be take off the street every single week through op warrior with many remand straight into prison and their case go through the court plead with the minister to rule out as soon as possible any of the measure recommend that would see those organise crime gang member potentially not even get criminal record it be bit rich to accuse those on the government benches of be soft on crime the hon gentleman party allow the prison to run hot and add prison place in year we have commit the money for that simply do not stand up to scrutiny the conservatives allow the backlog in the court to simply run out of control to the point where alex chalk again another of their own point out that the position would become irrecoverable that be the consequence of do nothing be tough on crime be about rebuild and invest in our criminal justice system invest in prison and our court deliver on the tough reform that will be require to deliver swifter justice for victim and get tough on exactly the sort of gang that the hon gentleman describe after year of conservative government victim of rape and serious sexual crime be wait year to see justice it appear that the shadow justice secretary have recently discover that our criminal justice system be break when do the minister think he will discover who break it that be not in order order mr stuart do not need any challenge from you you should know well you be on the speaker panel of chairs you really do have to think about what you be say your behaviour be get intolerable when the victims commissioner the london victims commissioner and those who engage and support victim through victim service tell that we have to take this opportunity for once in generation reform because we be let victim of crime down take that more seriously than any other plea for change it be absolutely obvious that the delay from run system with such record and rise backlog and the failure to invest have real consequence for people life people be pull out of the system and out of the process because they have simply lose faith in it will be think of their voice of the victim every day that we consider these proposal and drive they forward failure be not an option have caution about strip back jury trial so ask the government to commit to tackle court backlog by invest in more court capacity particularly in bristol and the west country by support rehabilitation to stop reoffende and people come back into the system so quickly and by address the root cause of crime will the minister consider that under the leveson proposal there may be space for some of the good example of the us court system some state have next day hearing for domestic abuse case where court can catch perpetrator in the window of remorse when they will recognise their guilt and accept that they need to change the hon member be right that as we take forward and be ready to announce the package of reform in response to sir brian review we will consider how we can take forward the good of our exist system and indeed learn from other system whether that be intensive supervision court where we have see some good result or tackle the root cause that lie behind crime and engage in preventive measure we should be do all that this be our opportunity we have reach point of crisis we have reach the point of emergency no more no less as result of the inheritance from the previous government but we have get to take the opportunity to build back well with more sustainable and more innovative justice system that the public can have confidence in and that protect the public that be what we must do the hon member be right we should learn we should listen and we should build something well as think member across the house would agree alex chalk the former lord chancellor and justice secretary be take seriously in this place as be his opinion he recently say that some case could conceivably be deal with by judge and two winger so reserve the crown court for the most serious case it be helpful to look at which case should be triable either way and which should be summary only do the minister agree that it be worth take note of serious voice like alex chalk rather than the opportunism of the shadow justice secretary this issue be far too serious not to take seriously listen to voice such as those of the former lord chancellor former lord chief justice sir ian burnett the victims commissioner and sir mark rowley they be all say that we have get to take these matter and these recommendation seriously it be that serious work that this government will engage in and we will not duck the difficult decision the minister rightly point to the comparative inefficiency between crown court and magistrate court the clear issue be that we need new technology to be introduce to crown court so that people who be on trial and victim be serve fast quick and more expediently the reality be that many case collapse as result of the evidence not be sufficient or bring fast enough why then have the minister allow the efficiency part of the leveson report to be delay that could bring forward much need recommendation that we could action to cut the backlog the hon member raise an extremely helpful point which be about how we can improve efficiency in our court through the use of technology include technology that be improve rapidly before our eye for example the ministry of justice be pilot the use of ai technology in some of our tribunal for transcription how could that be utilise and roll out more widely across court and tribunal he be absolutely right but sir brian and his team to give they their credit have work incredibly fast to produce detailed careful and well evidence report today he will continue with part of his review our job in the ministry of justice as we develop our policy thinking will be to bring those two part of the review together to improve our criminal justice system some may say we be old school in south norfolk but call it common sense criminal should be punish and victim should get their day of justice simply hop that more sit day will fix the crown court backlog be not realistic so urge the minister to be radical and ensure that offender be punish and victim get their day in court have the hon member actually read it can tell that my hon friend have take the liberty of actually read the report because he have identify the central premise and argument that sir brian leveson one of our most distinguished judge make in it which be this we can not simply sit our way out of the crisis we have inherit we need to carefully consider once in generation structural reform we have get to combine that with investment too which this government be already do with the additional sitting day that we have add over and above what the previous government agree my hon friend be absolutely right it be about investment plus reform do the minister accept that change to fundamental right such as trial by jury in one part of the united kingdom could create serious divergence across jurisdiction and raise question about equal access to justice for citizen in northern ireland as the hon member well know justice be devolved matter and it be right that decision involve justice be take at the correct level but assure she and the rest of the house that the state obligation to provide fair trial be paramount whether as be currently the case someone case be hear in the magistrate court without jury or whether as for the most serious case and as will continue to be the case case be hear with jury the point be that the state must deliver fair trial the question of equal access to justice therefore simply will not arise yesterday the bar council facilitate useful conversation with local barrister in the south west think they have some reservation but will leave they to make representation one thing that they do say which urge the minister to feed into the provision of the second half of the report be about the efficiency of the forensic service and the transfer mechanism to bring prisoner into the court the delay and inefficiency there and the contract that be lay that set out those service can have material impact on the efficiency of the court service urge the minister to make sure that that be focus on because that could have massive impact have grave concern about where thing be finally as chief secretary to the treasury allow against advice alex chalk and his predecessor to make some capital to revenue switch in their budget to deal with the urgency of this problem hope that be helpful to the minister in her negotiation with the treasury go forward good luck minister thank the right hon gentleman for his typically helpful and constructive contribution we be talk about system that have so many move part and that be why we will not give an instant response to sir brian review or to some of the point that the right hon gentleman raise it be clear that we have get to get the whole system work in that vein let address our profession and our criminal bar who do sterling job have engage closely with the bar council and the criminal bar association and we need to do this in collaboration with they it will be team effort to rebuild our criminal justice system and we will continue to engage over the summer as we bring together the necessary reform to bring down the backlog and deliver swifter justice for victim sympathise with the minister frustration at the tories brass neck there be clearly crisis in the criminal justice system and it be clearly of their making however rather than undermine the jury system we need to invest in our court do the minister agree that this be all about priority be she go to use her limited budget to build more prison and simply produce more prisoner or use that limited money to invest in the criminal justice system and restorative justice as have make clear we be invest in prison place only be add in year under the last government but we have commit money to the building of new prison place as well as comprehensive sentencing reform we have also commit million to investment in our court whether it be use for court maintenance additional fund for criminal legal aid or additional and now record crown court sitting day however as sir brian leveson tell we that be insufficient that alone will not see reduction in the delay affect the victim about whom we have hear so much today we must do what it take which necessitate both investment which we be already begin to make and reform as member of the bar say this plainly remove the right to jury trial be reckless constitutional shortcut as the criminal bar association put it be not reform but retreat do the minister agree that the right to choose between jury and judge lead trial must never be deny and that the real solution lie in invest in the system that we have rather than dismantle its very foundation respect the hon gentleman as fellow member of the bar but also respect the view of sir brian leveson the lord chief justice the former lord chief justice sir ian burnett and many other august legal mind who have themselves do so much to preserve our fundamental constitutional principle what they understand be this of our current criminal trial do not take place with jury but what really be unfair and what really do undermine fundamental constitutional right be failure to deliver timely trial if the hon gentleman be ask victim of crime or even those wrongly accuse of crime who want to clear their name to wait two or three year for their day in court that believe be denial of constitutional right thank sir brian leveson for his work and applaud all effort to speed up the system but what reassurance can the minister give my constituent who will see reduction in access to jury trial as the beginning of slippery edge lead to an ever great erosion of one of the fundamental liberty and glory of this country we be not set out our policy response to the specific recommendation in sir brian review today what we be recognise be his central thesis which be that at present victim include those in the right hon gentleman constituency be be thoroughly let down by the delay that be allow to accrue by his own party with that in mind think it be clear that what we have to do be continue to make the record investment that we be already make but combine it with structural reform package of reform that will not only drive efficiency but fundamentally deliver the swifter justice for victim that believe we all wish to see share the concern about delay in justice no rape victim should ever have to wait five year for their day in court but be seriously concerned about the limiting of trial by jury and how it could dent confidence as the minister consider these reform over the summer will she please give some thought to more serious investment in rehabilitation and resettlement work the landworks project in my constituency have reoffende rate of if we could roll out that type of work we would reduce crime which would relieve backlog in the court and everyone could have their day in court more quickly the holistic type of support involve the preventive intervention that the hon lady have describe be exactly the sort of provision that we be consider in combination with the investment and structural reform that will also be need know that my colleague in the other place the prisons minister be take on board precisely that sort of package of rehabilitation model so that we can break this endless cycle of reoffende over the weekend the prime minister rather pathetically tell the bbc that he be hard bastard think member of the public would find it surprising that let criminal out of prison early be way of show that he be the minister have say not unreasonably that she want time to consider sir brian recommendation but it be the case that some thing be clearcut will she take this opportunity to rule out reduce sentence by for criminal who plead guilty think that the prime minister probably be hard bastard and think that we on this side of the house be tough on law and order we would never allow what the conservative party allow to happen run our prison to the brink of collapse at the point when we inherit the prison system there be simply not enough place for we to lock up some of the most serious and dangerous criminal who have perpetrate crime in this country it be absolutely scandalous what we be go to do as the hon gentleman have rightly point out be engage in the serious business of develop policy and of government we be go to consider the detailed policy recommendation and of course we must consider how they interact with david gauke recommendation it must be knit together and it must be appropriate to deliver swifter justice for victim and to protect the public jury trial have be deeply embed in the british psyche and indeed in our constitution since henry ii who introduce it in order to deal fairly with land dispute it be also embed in the united states constitution through the sixth amendment to protect against biased judge and oppressive prosecution and to safeguard individual liberty have severe doubt about our judiciary at the moment be not sure that it be go in the right direction and when read the adult court bench book it give even great concern as the minister probably know jury trial be already under threat in defamation case have three question why do the government appear to be so terrified of decent british people sit on jury be the government intent on far undermine jury trial if they be in any way will they please undertake to hold full debate in the house before it happen if the hon gentleman have hear my early answer he would know that make it clear that jury trial would remain cornerstone of british justice in the most serious case in his review sir brian leveson consider whether jury trial be appropriate and proportionate when it come to for example some of the most complex fraud case he also consider whether it be proportionate when say someone have steal bottle of whisky be it appropriate to hold full jury trial with all the expense and delay involve when it mean that someone who be perhaps victim of rape be wait two or three year for their day in court or indeed that that day will never come however as say at the start what can undertake to do be this when we be ready with our package of reform and our response to the review we will return to the house and full debate can be have the jury system be essential to protect we against oppressive judge malicious individual sometimes malicious police officer or even government the minister speak of the most serious case be it not fact that the most serious impact on individual may result not necessarily from what she may regard as the most serious case but from any case that go to court the impact on the individual can totally change the course of that person life even if the charge be not as serious as the minister might consider it to be it can be devastating to the person family life career or any other aspect of his or her future as the right hon gentleman know and as say early of case in this country already happen without jury and no one say that that be not deliver justice of the high robustness and integrity let pick up his comment and indeed early comment denigrate the integrity and independence of our judiciary member will not hear that sort of criticism from this side of the house our judiciary be in fact one of the pride of this country it be why people so respect the rule of law and why the united kingdom be such great place in which to do business will not talk the judiciary down we need they and we respect they and on this side of the house we will adhere to that the justice secretary talk about the need to expedite trial for the sake of victim of crime and she be absolutely right as she consider the proposal from sir brian leveson will she take into account those who be innocent and who stand wrongly accuse who be have to wait anxiously for year for their day in court the hon gentleman make very good point our focus be on victim of crime who in some case be wait year for their day in court but on the other side of the coin defendant who be accuse of crime perhaps wrongly be wait to clear their name that can have devastating effect what he describe be the human impact of the delay that have accrue as result of the backlog that we inherit from the conservative party as barrister work in criminal court have often address the jury in close speech by say member of the jury we have the good legal system in the world and it be the good because you make it so you bring your wisdom your life experience and your common sense and you apply it to the fact in this case before you decide verdict of guilty bear in mind that if you or member of your family be sit in the defendant seat you would need to be sure before you return verdict of guilty as peer that be an obligation on you get the minister point that justice delay be justice deny but equally there be the principle that justice must not only be do but be see to be do sir brian leveson have be give basic mandate that we need to speed up jury trial which will eliminate the fundamental principle and the cornerstone of our legal system do the minister agree with that as have say the jury trial will remain cornerstone and pillar of our justice system in the most serious case but what sir brian leveson tell we in the open page of his report be that the current system be break and he use the word essential he say reform of the system will be essential because although we rightly take pride in the principle that underpin our criminal justice system the fact be that it be simply not work at the moment it be let down those whom it be intend to serve and those who serve within the system and we have to fix that we will take our time and then we will act on the programme of reform that sir brian leveson have recommend today for over year in northern ireland we have have judge only trial in terrorist case probably for understandable reason all non terrorist case have be jury trial in my professional life at both the junior and the senior bar have practise before all those court and my experience firmly confirm to that public confidence be most attainable when we have jury trial irrespective of how cautious and diligent judge be they can get case harden and that be the source of why public confidence rest most in the jury system do the minister agree that the key determinant in retain jury trial be whether an offence be indictable or not if it be an indictable offence the first port of call must be jury trial respect the hon and learn gentleman wealth of experience before our different sort of court but also respect the wealth of experience that sir brian leveson have bring to bear in his review he identify that although jury trial will always be appropriate for certain case not least for the reason that the hon and learn gentleman have outline we have to take proportionate response if we offer jury trial in all sort of case certain victim and defendant would have to wait far too long for their day in court as it stand the vast criminal trial in this country already happen without jury we have to consider very carefully where to draw the line and that be what the government will be do this summer the minister be hold in the high esteem by all of we in this chamber that be never in doubt the british justice system be the envy of the world and it probably set the example for justice system everywhere pose my question with the utmost respect the minister will understand members reluctance to restrict the right to jury of one peer and to replace multi person jury with judge only trial do she not believe that we must look at extend court day and at other interim measure rather than change the course of justice which have serve we well and which most democracy base their justice system on the hon gentleman will know that the respect across this house be absolutely reciprocate rather than sit idly we have take on the challenge of increase investment to deliver record number of crown court sit sit day above the level agree by the previous government we have increase investment in our criminal legal aid system to build capacity so that we can man all the additional trial and meet the demand on the system however the clear lesson from sir brian report and the key conclusion that he have deliver today which we will take firmly on board be that continue to try to sit our way out of the crisis be not sufficient it be essential that we make reform as well and we will take the time necessary to consider what that look like on point of order madam deputy speaker minister will be aware that have raise concern about the treatment and detention of lee stinton british national and the son of elaine and edward stinton who be my constituent in lagan valley he be detain by us immigration and customs enforcement while travel to work in key west florida he have build life for himself there but that have all come to an end in the most awful of circumstance at krome detention centre be grateful for the support offer to date by the foreign commonwealth and development office be minister seek to make statement on this matter be grateful for advance notice of that point of order have not be make aware of any request for statement but the hon member have put her concern on the record school allergy safety motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require school to maintain an allergy management policy to require school to hold supply of adrenaline auto injector for treat allergic reaction and anaphylaxis to require allergy training for staff in school and for connected purpose be grateful to the minister for be in his place and for his constant dialogue on this issue as he know be not the first to raise the inadequacy of our current law on protect child with allergy in our school many hon member from across this house have speak on the issue yet horrific incident and countless near miss continue many of we have experience of allergy and one in three people in the uk now live with an allergic disease hospital admission for allergic reaction have rise by in the past year and of child be now affect by at least one allergic condition every year approximately case of childhood allergy require care study show that the incidence of food allergy in england nearly double between and with prevalence of among pre school child at school food allergy affect around two child in every classroom child spend significant amount of their life at school and of food allergy reaction happen there include quarter of first time anaphylactic reaction many child who have have prior severe reaction be not prescribe their auto injector and many first time reaction occur at school so rely solely on child carry pre prepare medication be dangerous with an ever grow number of child require allergy care it have never be more vital that the place we entrust with the care of our child the school where we drop they off every day be safe and secure environment but too often it be not can not comprehend the pain that some family have have to endure because they have lose child and as father hope never to experience that grief but when current guidance and legislation allow patchwork of different standard in our school we can and must do well there be glaring lack of consistency across school in the uk in allergy management there be chance that the school someone child go to will have spare adrenalin auto injector pen available there be chance that no training have be provide to staff on manage allergy in school or on trip and there be one in four chance that staff have have no training on how to identify allergy symptom or what to do in an emergency furthermore there be one in six chance that school do not have an individual health care plan for pupil with allergy and one in three chance that school do not have an allergy policy at all there be also one in three chance that near miss of allergy incident be not record anywhere with the prevalence of allergy rise and steep increase in hospitalisation due to allergic reaction we must act to change this unacceptable status quo school staff deserve to know how to prevent allergic reaction and be prepared to manage they if horrendous incident occur child deserve to learn in safe and inclusive environment and parent deserve the confidence to send their child to school know that adequate measure be in place the schools allergy safety bill would require all school to have an allergy policy in place currently of school lack basic protection and one in three school have no allergy policy in place introduce these policy would create whole school approach to allergy safety make it everyone responsibility to embed good allergy practice and know their role in protect child this would include how to manage allergy on day to day basis in classroom playground and dining room ensure that child with allergy be not exclude but support in an inclusive school environment without these policy child with allergy often miss out on opportunity the natasha allergy research foundation find that of parent report that their allergic child have miss school due to their allergy sometimes drive by anxiety child should never miss learn opportunity out of fear and this bill can help change that alongside allergy policy the bill require allergy training for school staff enable they to create safe environment research from nasuwt and the natasha allergy research foundation show that of school staff have not receive any allergy awareness training the bill would provide guidance on adapt classroom practice to reduce risk ensure safe and inclusive activity understand the mental health impact of food allergy and how to respond in such emergency this bill also mandate that school carry spare adrenalin auto injector so that if reaction occur staff have both the medication and training to take swift action when every second count this simple step could be lifesave auto injector should be treat like defibrillator they should be accessible and accompany by train member of staff although there be example of good practice without national framework it be postcode lottery whether child will attend school where there be staff with adequate training and policy and vital medication this inequality lead to miss school day unnecessary emergency visit bullying and low attainment provide spare pen training and policy for every school remove that lottery safety should not depend on child location or their family income the current legislation be insufficient school in england follow statutory guidance such as support pupil at school with medical condition and the early year foundation stage statutory framework but neither explicitly mandate safeguard for pupil with allergy the benedict blythe foundation highlight that this lack of clear expectation lead to wide variation in allergy safety across the country the three pillar of this bill staff training allergy policy and spare adrenalin auto injector can save life these recommendation come from coroner report after tragic incident we must learn and fill these gap to create fair safe school experience for all child too many teacher lack the knowledge they need and do not have the support they deserve and too many child with allergy be still not offer safe fit for purpose environment in which to learn hope that today after an awful lot of talking we can get on with the doing question put and agree to order that chris

receive universal credit and disability benefit have use food bank in the last month and when scope have find that the disability price tag be per month here in parliament we must do well than this bill before we today when the pathway to work green paper have terrify so many of our constituent and when the basic rate of universal credit can not cover the basic essential here in parliament we must do well than this bill before we today when the ultra rich be order of magnitude away from the tough choice disabled people face and when we have such deeply unequal society and wealth tax would break no manifesto commitment here in parliament we must do well than this bill before we today from the green paper to where we be now the government behaviour have be an insult to disabled people and think they should be ashamed and should apologise my constituent who receive benefit and the people who love and care for they have be subject to chaos confusion and indignity instead of make improvement with careful consideration to complex and treacherous benefit system the government have rush to fit the imperative of the budget timetable bypass evidence gathering and line by line scrutiny in committee of this house and far limit the power of the other place by make this money bill yes tremendous effort of people power and bravery from labour members have win last minute concession for current claimant but the government should still scrap this unfair and harmful legislation due to the harm that it will do to people who find themselves in need of support in future this bill be not tough decision it be the wrong decision here in parliament we must do well than this bill before we today commend the hon lady for the proposal that she be bring forward this be the crux of the bill do she accept that the reason why people get more money when they qualify for the health element of universal credit be that their illness mean more expenditure certain diet the need for warm home and so on do she accept that halve it to month will detrimentally affect the most vulnerable people the very people she say we should be try to help thank the hon member for give those example of the vital thing that additional payment be use for they be so necessary and it be so necessary not to cut they my amendment affect clause the only at all positive clause in the bill as it stand the clause uplift the rate of increase in the standard allowance of universal credit beyond inflation by in the year start april rise to for my amendment simply set the uplift percentage at for the whole period this sustain rise in the basic rate of universal credit be much need set out the case for an essential guarantee the trussell trust and the joseph rowntree foundation state the basic rate of universal credit should at least cover the cost of essential like food household bill and travel but it be not currently set accord to any objective assessment of what people need amendment go some way towards ensure that and the joint briefing to mps from charity service provider and disabled people group highlight this need in its recommendation realise that the question on many people mind be how can the country pay for this boost to universal credit and the removal of cut to the personal independence payment the answer lie with the chancellor and something that my green colleague and have call for many time especially on this issue ever since the secretary of state introduce the green paper on that day march ask why impoverish disabled people to the tune of billion be high priority than simple wealth tax official report march vol the hon member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford for liverpool riverside kim johnson and for liverpool west derby ian byrne also speak up for such tax on the same day many hon member have ask the same question in the house and it be not just mp make this suggestion it be not just charity such as oxfam and the equality trust not just campaigner such as tax justice uk and green new deal rise and not just patriotic millionaires uk which say that its polling show that of people who have more than million would happily pay of their wealth to support well society and public service two former leader of the labour party be also now talk about it as serious option there be should say other way to tax unearned wealth as part of wide package than the way set out in this simple proposal which be make unlikely ally of greens millionaire and labour leader think the view of this house be clear when fairer taxis on asset which absolutely can work and should work for the nation be finally put into the budget first to go should be the cut target set out in the department for work and pensions spreadsheet and the two child benefit cap it be through such tax that we should pay for the improvement need to the bill be great believer in wealth tax rather than take money from disabled people simple as bottom line what would wealth tax look like as far as the green party be concern thank the hon member for that question refer he to patriotic millionaires uk it have do considerable work on this issue with its considerable resource and set out proposal for wealth tax on people who have more than million in wealth it poll the general public on that and find that of they hugely support the measure not just as an alternative to cut to welfare but as general principle clause would be make into genuinely good policy by amendment but that change alone will not make this bill that the house should pass remove clause as government amendment propose will not be enough either to make this bill that this house should pass clause even once amend by the government would cut in half the health element of universal credit for nine in new claimant will speak later about the severe condition criterion and fluctuate condition without amendment table by the hon member for leeds east richard burgon clause should be remove from the bill clause would freeze the health element of universal credit for the rest of this parliament so clause should also be remove from the bill subsection and of clause would freeze legacy benefit for disabled people so they should be remove from the bill as my amendment propose bill that just consist of much improve clause and possibly much improve clause would almost be bill that this house could in conscience pass we have the choice to craft such bill today as well as those change amendment such as amendment table by the hon member for torbay steve darling be need and there be some new clause that would help make the bill even more fit for purpose the vital principle we must stand up for today be that any policy change relate to disabled people must be lead by disabled people on the day the green paper be publish raise the matter of co production with the secretary of state that word have be much talk about by many other with experience of co produce policy and by the government thank to strong campaigner and pressure from mps fully agree with the hon member on co production and co design any change that come forward do she agree that it be crucial that young people be also include give the condition that they can face and especially give the challenge in move from child disability living allowance to the personal independence payment which the minister have still not address thank the hon member greatly for that intervention when have gather together young people in my constituency have find that the issue that they face be unique and their voice absolutely must be hear the government have say that they be commit to co produce the timms review with disabled people and disabled people organisation but organisation such as disability rights uk have tell we that those promise be hard to trust they fear tick box exercise co production in name only and that the government original plan will be the inevitable result that be why have sign up to new clause table by the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell as well as new clause table by the hon member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball if clause and its schedule remain the severe condition criterion simply can not stand as write it appear that the government either mean to exclude people with fluctuate lifelong condition such as parkinson or multiple sclerosis from the high rate of the universal credit health element or that ministers completely overlook that community when rush all this through criteria that withdraw support from people with fluctuating condition be unacceptable and that be why sign amendment table by the hon member for york central rachael maskell and amendment table by the hon member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie the severe condition criterion also say that any diagnosis must be make in the nhs again that be either careless drafting or deliberate restriction so have also sign amendment from the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman be try to bring to this house the voice of disabled people in brighton pavilion and across the nation who be closely watch what we do today so many of our constituent remain scared by the bill right from the day of the sudden and careless release of the green paper which contain terrifying policy detail that be not in the labour manifesto they have be force into cruel limbo it be shameful that the government have choose this path this labour government be show themselves far more willing to punish disabled people than ask the most wealthy to shoulder the burden of fair public spending on real social security be so proud of the people power that have be bring to bear on the bill action by disabled people and their ally have force mp to listen and take action and force the government to withdraw the most brutal cut but still the bill remain unacceptable without the serious amendment that have outline look forward to hear much sense include what the united nations have tell we from the many hon member in this debate who share my value my green colleague and be ready to do all in our power to minimise the consequence of the bill to make it do good not harm and ultimately if that do not happen to see it fall hope the government will truly learn from the cruel mess that this have become call the chair of the select committee will speak to my amendment and the amendment associate with it before get to the substance of my remark thank the bill committee clerks for their invaluable advice and amendment draft expertise thank the dozen of disabled people organisation disability charity academic and think tank who provide evidence to the work and pensions committee pathway to work inquiry also acknowledge the clerks team and in particular the deputy clerk who lead that inquiry the role of select committees in improve government policy be of immense importance and can not be overestimate as say last week there be general recognition that the social security system need reform but reform should not be equate to cut to the support for vulnerable people there be many positive measure in the pathway to work green paper and the get britain work white paper that will have significant positive impact on people life and that will help people into work and to stay in work however there be also evidence of the impact other departments will have on get and keep britain work increase nhs capacity and the funding allocation to area of high health need will have direct and positive impact on health status participation in the labour market and ultimately productivity in those area the health for wealth report estimate that increase nhs spending by and target that at area of high health need would reduce economic inactivity by and increase productivity by billion year however although we have launch the nhs year plan which contain many positive measure the additional target nhs capacity will not come on stream until april next year sir charlie mayfield review on keep britain work will hopefully set out how we can realign our labour market to address the disability employment gap include by retain skilled worker who become sick or disabled but similarly that will not be publish until the autumn it will take lot long than six month to make the cultural change need to address the inequality in employment that many disabled people face accord to the joseph rowntree foundation for each disability confident role across the country there be currently people on incapacity benefit such as uc health more job be available in more affluent area but in more deprived former industrial area it be much bad with one job for every disabled people that be why my amendment to amendment and the associate amendment seek to delay the introduction of change to uc health from april to november which would come at cost of million in term of the reduction in saving previously estimate by the government the propose delay would allow for the ramping up of nhs capacity and ensure that funding follow health need so that people with newly acquire condition or impairment can receive early treatment as well as allow for well aligned labour market to enable they to return to work quickly without the propose delay there be risk that more newly disabled people and their child will be push into poverty acknowledge and thank the government for the concession that have be make over the past couple of week which allow many of we to support the bill on second reading to clarify those concession include the protection of exist pip claimant and the removal of the requirement for new pip claimant to achieve four point at their assessment through government amendment which delete clause instead from november new claimant will take part in new assessment which will be an outcome of the timms pip review that be to be co produce with disabled people and their organisation one issue that hear about like other member be sure be the decision make on pip universal credit and esa application constituent tell continually that there be harshness in how those decision be make do the hon lady agree that those application should be look at by expert and that there should be compassion and understanding when the decision be make do she agree that that be the sort of system we need for the people we represent be grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention agree that we need more compassionate system but also believe we need system that be co produce by the people who will actually be affect by new assessment process yes we need system that be more compassionate but think that that will be build in by the people who co produce the new assessment be little disappointed that the government do not take the opportunity to include the co production of the review in the bill hope the minister will address that in his remark but for that reason support new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball in addition the government have agree to protect people on uc health with severe condition or terminal diagnosis both exist and new claimant and to ensure that their award will be uprate annually in real term like my hon friend welcome some of the last minute concession that be make last week do she share my concern in particular around uc health that there be still billion in cut that will impact more than people mean that they will get less these be some of the most vulnerable people let we be clear this will apply to newly acquire condition in particular my argument be that by delay the change we can ensure that people with newly acquire disability or condition can receive treatment and care quickly by make sure that the nhs ramp up its treatment process do not think it be ideal but it be reasonable compromise and hope the government will listen as say people with both new and exist severe condition will be protect this understand be cover in government amendment and new clause there be significant evidence of the harm that disabled people would potentially have experience if the bill have remain in its previous form but the concession that have be make over the past couple of week have address that applaud the government for that it be definitely the right thing to do when the evidence be provide when our fiscal rigidity be set to cause harm and undermine what we be try to do in the long term it be right that we think again and iusb therefore urge the government to consider my amendment there be strong evidence that the government will make saving in social security spending in the long term through case off flow as have mention before that will be achieve naturally through the additional capacity in the nhs the realignment of the labour market and of course the bring forward of the employment support it be pleasure to take part in this debate the bill be be rush through by labour government desperate to paper over the crack in an economy that they themselves have bring to shudder halt so many of the question that be come before the house at the moment be the result of that economic flatlining and the flailing of government who be cast around desperately to see how they can get themselves off that economic hook put simply the bill be unaffordable the prime minister late concession to his unruly back benchers now happy and victorious have leave the exchequer with billion gap to plug which inevitably mean high taxis for hard work family who be already feel the pinch far too few of those voice will be hear today too often in debate in this house members be consume with the idea that more spending be well thing that can always be afford and therefore no responsible decision need to be make that be the decision of the labour back benchers who wrest from those on the front bench control of one of the flagship of this government agenda leave the government massively endow as they be with member of parliament like some gigantic ship that have lose all power and propulsion list at sea wait for the next wave to come along rise as we in this chamber know the next wave that come along and buffet this labour government from the left come all too often from the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy to whom be happy to give way thank the right hon gentleman for give way hope he be not suggest that the hard work family who use pip to be able to get to work be not voice that we should hear in this chamber absolutely agree with the hon lady that we should consider such people think of the lady who come to see on saturday at my street surgery she be concern about the brutality of the pip process and the way that she and her husband who have degenerative progressive disease for which there be no cure be put through the wringer to justify their situation which anyone with any common sense would see deserve support but the hon lady will be aware of the mushroom in claim from those with various level of mental health challenge ultimately we must balance look after people with degenerative progressive disease in humane and civilised manner with make sure that we have system that cut out fraud and that seek to minimise those who do not need aid seek it and get it if only we could have system in which people do not claim for money that they do not deserve and need we would be able to look after the people whom think this be one area of commonality between the hon lady and both she and would agree require fair and more generous treatment do the right hon member agree that the reduction in investment in the nhs and in mental health service support for the people of our country have lead to an epidemic of people who have have to wait for support sometimes for nearly two year which worsen their condition and make it hard for they to recover and go back to their normal daily life at work that also lead to an increase demand on pip thank the hon gentleman for his contribution we on the conservative benches know that throw money at problem without proper safeguard be not leadership be not generous and be not kind but be an abrogation of responsibility and economic negligence let be clear this bill in its current form lock in billion of pound of additional welfare spending year after year under the current chancellor we have already see britain debt interest forecast soar and the bond market become jittery more than that they be charge far more than after the mini budget to which labour member so love to refer and inflation of course have prove stubbornly high now we have yet another unfunded spending commitment with no plan to pay for it except reach deeply into taxpayer pocket the chancellor might not say it outright but family in beverley and holderness and across the country know exactly where this end up with they pay more the prime minister can indulge in his favourite hobby of turn his way throughout his time in office but that be not govern in the national interest which be what he promise to do it be the late example of the prime minister bend to pressure from the left of his party which be so well represent on the government benches today desperate as he be to shore up support for drift government who have lose all propulsion instead of fix the underlie problem in our economy or fix the foundation as have oft be repeat labour have choose the easy political route of high spending high borrowing and inevitably high taxis those high taxis will be impose not on some mythical class of super rich people which the greens like to propose but on ordinary man and woman who get up in the morning work hard look after themselves and recognise personal responsibility as central tenet of their life that also need to be central tenet of our political life that be why have table two amendment to the bill amendment would ensure that parliament retain control over future annual above inflation increase it would mean that the house of commons must explicitly approve continue those rate beyond protect against open end commitment that we can not afford new clause would require the government to report on fraud and error arise from these provision will the right hon member give way give the scale of welfare fraud that we have see in recent year it already cost the taxpayer more than billion it be only right that we get proper handle on where taxpayer money be actually go rise go on give way would happily give way if there be labour members who have an interest in control the public finance rather than run up the national credit card irresponsibly which be their wo not those effort by the front bench team have now come to nought they have give in to their back benchers and they no long have any control or say on the direction of this government together these straightforward safeguard to protect the public purse would help reduce waste and misuse have no doubt that the secretary of state will stand up today and try to paint this as fair and measured bill interruption labour member can shout and scream in frustration but they will have their time to speak in reality this be not fair and measured bill it achieve nothing but two tier benefit system unfunded spending commitment and ultimately high taxis for ordinary work people it be tell that the secretary of state have not match these spending increase with robust plan to tackle fraud and error or tie any uplift with measure to help people back into work in short the secretary of state have fail to ensure that there be clear performance measure in place to guarantee value for money for the taxpayer without that taxpayer will continue on their slippery slope of simply pay more while get less will the right hon member give way on that point about fraud if the hon gentleman who be so energetically rise from his place can tell we how he be committed to ensure that the public finance of this country be keep in healthy state and the house look forward to it with bated breath be really intrigue madam deputy speaker because the right hon member suggest that he have concern about tackle fraud and responsibility in public finance can he tell we where he be under the previous government when fraud in the benefit system hit its high level ever see in the history of the uk social security system where be his reference in hansard where be he on bill committees and in this house when that fraud be soar and where be he when this government begin pass legislation to tackle that horrific level of irresponsible fraud in the benefit system the hon gentleman will know that as the benefit system grow the likelihood be that fraud will grow within it applaud all effort to crack down on fraud want to see great effort by those on the front bench to do that but he know that it be those sit on the back benches who be now call the shot ultimately all road lead back to the treasury the truth be that the bill be not the product of serious policymaking neither in its inception nor its eventual outcome gutte and fillet as it have be by triumphant leave in the labour party instead it be the product of panic rush response to economic pressure cause by feeble chancellor who have bring the economy to halt it have be write not with reform in mind but with rebellion in the rear view mirror the result be muddled mean spirited piece of legislation that satisfy no one least of all the vulnerable people who will suffer under it or the british taxpayer who will pay for it the right hon member be right to bring his speech back to the vulnerable people who will be impact he will know the devastating impact of cancer on many family one in two face the reality of cancer diagnosis young life vs cancer have say that on average the disease cost month and in annual income do he agree that the bill by ensure that those people do not get the high rate universal credit health element will be devastating for many cancer patient right across the country the hon lady be absolutely right to highlight the plight of cancer sufferer and the need to have system that be more generous to those who genuinely need it but be also tough in ensure that the funding go to the place where it be most require under this chancellor as we know britain risk return to the same old labour habit spend today tax tomorrow and leave the mess for someone else to clear up we see that under gordon brown and we be see it again today the public deserve well than another labour tax and spend spiral that leave less money in their pocket and less resilience in our economy the bill in its current form be short term fix with long term cost it fail to tackle fraud fail to address get people back into work despite all the protestation from ministers that it have anything to do with that fail to guarantee value for money and fail work family by pave the way for inevitable tax rise if labour want to be take seriously on economic credibility it need to start by show some discipline on spending and not indulge in spending spree that britain simply can not afford the prime minister promise serious government remember grow up government yet here we be debate confused divisive bill whose main achievement so far be to split the prime minister own benches rise if the hon lady want to tell that the bill be not confused or divisive and have not be drive by the ruction on the back benches look forward to hear her intervention the right hon gentleman will understand that it be for to decide what my intervention will be be go to say that be very pleased to hear he stick up for people who really need help what part of new clause actually make thing well for people who need help the hon lady should recognise that look after the public finance minimise fraud and ensure that this house keep control of public expenditure be exactly in the interest of the most vulnerable who will pay the high price as this economic spiral go downwards as always under labour government it will be ordinary work people the increase number of unemployed people and vulnerable and disabled people they be always the one who pay the price for labour government when the last labour government leave power in youth unemployment be up that be their record on young people who be most vulnerable to the negative impact of unemployment it be those vulnerable group who be always let down by labour government and most of all by labour government that be run not by those with some sense of public finance control but by their back benchers who be out of control do the right hon gentleman not agree that it be year of conservative government that lead we to disability employment gap pay gap million disabled people in poverty and the un tell the last government over the first half of their decade that they fail on almost every single commitment in the convention on the right of person with disability thank the hon lady for her intervention and respect she great deal she will be aware that under the last conservative government million more disabled people come into the employment market around million possibly as many as million more disabled people enter the employment market and have the dignity of work the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer have no credible plan to get our economy grow hard work family in beverley and holderness and right across the country deserve well than another labour government chase short term headline at the cost of long term economic growth and stability last week chaos and climbdown have be overshadow by event of the last hour the impact assessment publish last night show that billion be still to be strip from up to three quarter of million sick and disabled people by through the slashing of the health element of universal credit in two by the end of this parliament some people will lose around year because of these reform include those with fluctuating condition if that be not bad enough the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights have wad in to protect disabled people where this labour government have not believe that international law and convention must be uphold but this government be now under investigation for breach no matter what the spin be pass the bill tonight will leave such stain on our great party which be found on value of equality and justice the only way out be to withdraw clause and so that breach of the un convention on the right of person with disability be not uphold the un contention be my contention sick and disabled people have not be consult if someone with fluctuating physical or mental health condition such as multiple sclerosis schizophrenia cystic fibrosis or recur musculoskeletal condition have period of remission and work but then relapse and return to universal credit unless unequivocally state otherwise in the bill they would return on to the pittance of week for their health element my constituency have one of the high unemployment rate at and many of my constituent receive the universal credit health element do the hon member agree that if they be to be strip of financial support that may have an enormous impact on their mental health which would cause further drain on the nhs thank the hon member for his intervention we know that when people mental health decline because of stress and strain it push they far away from the labour market which be not the objective of pathway to work or this government it would be detrimental to people and our ambition that pittance of week will hit the budget of individual who have so little give that we have rise energy and food price and housing cost this be the difference between struggle and survive all they could expect be poverty to bite hard stress to spread wider and hope to fade fast for many with fluctuating condition stress exacerbate symptom what way to live the hon member be make powerful and compassionate speech recently knock on the door of one of my constituent who suffer from fibromyalgia and it happen to be the day that she receive letter tell she that she be expect to up her work hour by six hour follow an assessment she be break by this news and exactly the kind of mental distress that the hon member be refer to be evident to do the hon member agree that whatever reform we introduce must put compassion and care for individual at the heart of the assessment system so that people particularly those with fluctuating condition do not experience the kind of distress that witness that day from my constituent the hon member advocate powerfully for his constituent and all those with fluctuating condition who never know how they will fare perhaps because of the season of the year some people may develop more chest infection over the winter while be well for the rest of the year yet they will be receive health element of just week not week will my hon friend recognise how the bill protect people in exactly the situation that she describe those who receive the universal credit health premium at the moment will be fully protect and once they go into work they be likely to continue to receive universal credit so their protection will carry on if their income exceed the universal credit level there will be further six month when they be earn at significant level when if they come out of work afterwards they will come straight back on to the position they be in at the start there be very strong protection for exactly the people she be describe be grateful for that intervention from the minister this be where this get incredibly technical there can not be an assumption that all of those people be on low wage many of they have work all their life as their condition have develop and be therefore in the later stage of their career so their salary perhaps do exceed the threshold with many of the condition have list and many more someone could have period of remission for eight or nine month or even more and they would therefore not be able to continue with the six month of support they will exceed that and would be see accord to our previous discussion as new claimant and would drop to week rather than remain on week my amendment will protect those people it will also protect people with cancer who could recover go back to work and then receive the news that the cancer have return or metastasise if they then lose their job do they go back to week or week can they eat or not eat as if life be not hard enough for they they may then receive that shatter news my amendment would be remedy for those people and for the many who need this support worry that without such guarantee and with the single assessment to be co produce by the timms review accord to pathway to do not know either whether the eligibility criterion for qualify for the uc health element because of its association with pip will be more or less stringent than they be now the bill do not say again the bill sequence be wrong it be the cart before the horse the vote before the review this omnishamble of bill leave people with fluctuate condition not know where they stand or where any of we stand by the end of today it be wrong to leave sick and disabled people with such uncertainty amendment would make life just little bit more certain but in reality unless clause and go the bill be withdraw or the un high commissioner for human rights expose the truth sick and disabled people will be far stress and as the charity and deaf and disabled people organisation warn last night there will be tragedy that be why can not support the government so here we be again no agency no co production and no idea how this tragic tale will end just ask that it end tonight on the right side of history through acceptance of my amendment at least for those with fluctuate condition we be at really interesting point with this bill year worth of politic happen last week and it feel like there be more to come like the chair of the work and pensions committee the hon member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams begin by thank all the disabled people organisation who have work incredibly hard and assist we in win some concession no matter where we end up they should be incredibly proud of the work they have put in as should the disabled people already receive pip and the universal credit limited capability for work element who have continue to fight on behalf of future claimant even though they have no selfish need to do so that show the strength of the community and the amount that disable people care for each other it be unfortunate that disabled people need to come together in group to fight what be suppose to be labour government give the change promise by ministers that first change should not have be to attack old people by cut the winter fuel payment the government have also refuse to take action on child poverty by bring forward the child poverty strategy and now they be balance the budget by cut money from disabled people this be not the labour party that write about in my history highers write about the rise of the labour party what it be found on and how the whole point of it be about support people and the principle of the left this be not what imagine labour government would look like have hop that they would actually deliver for some people for disabled people and those the tories spend year marginalise yet they be choose to make the easy cut that affect disabled people do not think those be the right cut to make agree entirely with my green colleague the hon member for brighton pavilion siân berry who suggest that there be much well way of balance the budget the fiscal rule be self impose anyway to look at some of the specific issue with the bill agree with the hon member for brighton pavilion in relation to the essential guarantee and amendment make people poor will not magically improve their health fully agree with new clause on co production and urge the minister to take action on that in scotland we have create the adult disability payment if the minister look on the social security scotland website he will see that it say social security be human right any of we at any time may need this support we centre the decision making on dignity fairness and respect be not say for second that the adult disability payment be perfect there be issue with every system but urge the minister to look at how it be co produce and the lesson we learn from that when he be plan the co production of the review of pip assessment be massively concerned that we be not clear about the basis on which the timms review be be do what be the point of the review understand that it be to review the pip assessment process have get that bit but what be the government aim be it to cut billion of pound from the pip bill be it to make the assessment process more humane so that people with chronic condition do not have to fill in the same form over and over again explain what it be that they can not do be it to reduce the number of mandatory reconsideration be it to make the system well centre it on dignity and respect some clarity from the government on that would be incredibly helpful be sure that the hon lady be familiar with the term of reference for the timms review which clearly set out that its purpose be to ensure that pip assessment be fair and fit for the future and help support disabled people to achieve well health high living standard and great independence hope that she will agree that my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability be very well place to lead the review in co production with disabled people thank the hon member for clarify that it would be great if the minister could clarify from the dispatch box that there be no requirement on he or his review to save money if the hon member can give that commitment on behalf of the minister that be great but have the treasury ask the minister to reduce the bill if the term of reference say we do not want money to be save that be grand but could not find that in the term of reference would like to hear from the minister on whether he have be ask to save money through the review disabled people look at this have already be terrify by the government action and their pathway to work green paper think we should hear from the minister whether he will be try to save money or put dignity fairness and respect at the heart of the decision make process and ensure that co production happen with that have some question about the severe condition criterion be concerned because the bill wording be different from what the dwp have be put out in press release press release such as the one quote today in the guardian have be say that people with fluctuating condition will be eligible under the severe condition criterion however the bill say that claimant would need to have condition constantly the minister need to give an explicit commitment from the dispatch box the uk government have decide not to give the bill proper bill committee where we would have ask these question hash this out and get that level of clarification and people be really scared as the minister will know significant number of amendment have be table on these condition from party across the house concern have be raise because schedule to the bill state descriptor constantly apply to claimant if that descriptor apply to the claimant at all time or as the case may be on all occasion on which the claimant undertake or attempt to undertake the activity describe by that descriptor so if one of the descriptor be about be able to get around or be able to wash yourself that paragraph say that the descriptor must apply constantly if that be not the case we need clear explanation about that from the minister can not find the need for condition to apply constantly in previous legislation it seem to that this be new addition last week we hear the minister say from the dispatch box that descriptor activity and associate point will all be subject to the timms review which will be co produce with disabled people be the hon member listen to that statement and do she accept that as fact give at the dispatch box no the timms review be about personal independence payment be talk here about be the descriptor relate to limited capability for work they be totally different thing do not understand how the timms review could possibly cover this paragraph because it be about personal independence payment and the assessment process for that if it be cover by the timms review why have the government not remove it from the bill why be there not clause in the bill right now that remove the severe condition criterion and that specific paragraph the form of word in the bill include the word constant exactly replicate the way the severe condition criterion be apply at the moment the constant refer to the applicability of the descriptor if somebody have fluctuating condition and perhaps on one day they be comfortably able to walk metre the question to put to that person by the assessor be can you do so reliably safely repeatedly and in reasonable time if the answer to that question be no the descriptor still apply to they the question be whether the descriptor apply constantly if it do the severe condition criterion be meet that clear information from the dispatch box be what be ask for hear that will give people lot of comfort as the minister be aware commitment from the dispatch box will be look at when it come to any sort of legal challenge in relation to the descriptor if people be not ask if they can or can not do something reliably on other day will expect disabled people charity to use the minister comment from the dispatch box when they bring mandatory consideration or challenge to say the minister be utterly clear that have answer the question correctly in line with the legislation encourage they to do so give the way the legislation be write will still not support the severe condition criterion and the cut agree with colleague who have say that people be expect to lose money as result of this as one of my labour colleague the hon member for york central rachael maskell have say this be still billion of cut on disabled people that the labour party have choose to make or that be what it say in the impact assessment it have choose to make that cut to people ask itself where can we make billion of cut know let do it to disabled people we could have an additional billion in taxis on the very rich people who do not rely on that money for the everyday item that they desperately require completely agree with that contention this be how we judge society by how it take care of the most vulnerable as the hon lady say and not to discredit anybody but it appear on the face of it that people have simply decide to say this be where we will go when in actual fact there be other avenue that can be explore and people want we to do that before we get into any of this the hon member have be real champion for her constituent in this and she be absolutely correct this be not the first place that would expect any mp to look to save money and especially not the first place where would expect supposedly progressive government to look to save money be deeply disappointed that we have end up in this situation and unlike what be say before do not think there be victorious face on the back benches think people on the government benches be absolutely heartsick no matter what side of this debate they be on they wish that those on the government front bench have not put this forward and that they be not in the position of have to pick side because it should never ever have come down to labour government choose to make cut on old people child in poverty and disabled people as their first matter of business order the wind up speech will have to start at pm there be member stand on both side of the house be not allow to impose time limit but be to do so it would be about four minute it be for member to decide whether to allow their colleague to speak or to take up more of the time in which case it be quite clear that not everybody will be call to speak call john mcdonnell will do my good sir roger want to address new clause table in my name it be procedural clause and do not think it be particularly contentious before address the new clause want to say that be still get email and still be meet on the bus and at community event by people who be extremely distressed about this legislation go through want to put on record for my constituent that as always will not vote for any legislation that cut benefit to some of the poor people represent just can not do that and want that underline ironically just to give some context some member may have listen today to an interview on the today programme with george osborne who be now the chair of the british museum in which he be talk about the bayeux tapestry come to this country remember another tapestry which be bring to this house when he introduce cut to benefit for disabled people it show the name of the people who have commit suicide do hon member remember that it be one of the most distressing thing have see in my political life and weep that day do not want that to happen again let we be honest as sure as night follow day if cut go through on the scale propose people will lose their life people will suffer immense harm let we all understand that member talk pompously about the house at its good but last week debate be good day for the house people on all side express their view the government respond although not as far as want they to respond and the house hold the government to account it be not often that we see that but it happen and the reason it happen be that we be deal with primary legislation that hon member could debate and amend have put this new clause forward because if the government do anything they should do it through primary legislation and not delegate legislation which go on in committee where there be no chance to amend it and it be often rush through on vote with no debate this matter be so important that that be not the way we should operate as house last week hon member on all side of the debate show how democracy should work in this chamber that be why my new clause say that the government must bring forward primary legislation in draft form so that we can all see it no bouncer any more and it be not do as delegate legislation so that member do not have the chance to amend it or properly discuss it that be all ask for and to be frank it be not contentious would expect the government just to accept it because it be the normal democratic process in this chamber want to be able to go back to my constituent when the review come forward and say argue your case try to amend it win on some and lose on other that democracy support new clause table by the hon member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball it be truly an excellent setting out of how co production could work the only element on which disagree with she be when the process move on and we become dependent on the government make statement which we could reject so that they could not move on the problem with that be exactly the same as with delegate legislation we can not amend statement have be here so long that know what government do they bring forward statement include some good stuff that we can not vote against but there be also some bad stuff that we disagree with if we can not amend it at that stage it be all or nothing and as result we get bad legislation none the less the part of new clause that set out who should be consult be involve and elect the chair be critical do not want to sound patronising but the speech make by the hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge last week bring tear to my eye and it be not often speech in this house do that the justified anger that she express about what go on under the tories move deeply and think it move the whole house do not want member stand up in five year time equally angry about what we do in this legislation want we to be able to hold the government to account not aggressively but constructively in way that we can debate and amend and hopefully we might even be able to build consensus that be what my new clause be all about and that be all want to say rise primarily to speak to the amendment table by my hon friend the member for faversham and mid kent helen whately however would like to begin by address the amendment bring forward by the secretary of state for work and pensions we be first present with the universal credit and personal independence payment bill in june then after be hold over barrel by her back benchers the secretary of state return to the house with something quite different then at the eleventh hour on second reading just last week amendment and be hastily draw up why it be to cobble together enough support to get something that resemble welfare reform over the line only labour government could pledge to reduce the cost of something and end up do the exact opposite the people who will pay the price for this additional welfare spending be our constituent who get up early work hard and pay their due new clause and the associate amendment be key to fairness in the system key to protect the social contract that underpin our society and most importantly key to balance the book to support our economy there be no way we can continue to have situation where individual receive their pip payment after attend only virtual session there be no way we can continue to have spiral welfare bill drive by the over medicalisation of condition such as ocd and anxiety and finally there be no way we can continue to hand out benefit willy nilly to those who have come to the united kingdom without any mean of support themselves these be not fringe view they be widely support by the public by work man and woman across the country who do the right thing and who increasingly ask why be we foot bill for system we no long believe in the social contract be fray and the blame lie not with the public but with the state in allow the system to drift and grow to unsustainable level hope the hon member do not mind my intervening on he but want to pick up on the point he be make about people that come to this country and take benefit be he aware that during the pandemic for example people who have leave to remain be unable to avail themselves of any social security support as they do not have recourse to public fund and that they be leave absolutely destitute hope he will withdraw his remark because it be just not true have lot of respect for the hon lady but be not go to withdraw the comment make because there be people in that situation no there be not order the social contract be fray as say when my constituent nick who work hard for the money he earn and pay into system walk through his town centre he ask himself what be the point why be work hard than ever when the system reward those that often do these amendment matter they be not unfair they be principle they would ensure that the welfare system remain strong for those who truly need it and fair for those who fund it the hard work british public expect we to act and unfortunately if the government do not support our amendment today they will be let the public down rise to speak to new clause and government amendment this bill have be transform since second reading welcome the government significant change and hard work say that could not support the measure that remain on the face of the bill last week that would have push people into poverty nor could accept proposal for point system which under previously propose descriptor would exclude eligibility for those who can not put on their underwear prosthetic limb or shoe without support towards the end of the second reading debate the government promise to remove clause on personal independence payment include the eligibility criterion wholeheartedly support government amendment which achieve that be pleased to hear that the new impact assessment by the department for work and pensions have find that the bill will now lift people out of relative poverty by this matter to fulfil the government obligation under the equality act and to meet our commitment to the un convention on the right of person with disability in under the conservative government when the un produce its inquiry report on the uk treatment of disabled people it say that the government at that time have to ensure that any measure of welfare reform should uphold the human right model of disability and do not disproportionately or adversely affect the right of disabled people to live independently or to access employment welcome the amendment but do my hon friend agree that co production need to go beyond oversight if we want to build trust and engagement with disabled people and their organisation and that we need to commit to the principle of co production as outline in my speech on second reading last week do indeed agree with my hon friend and will be get to those point shortly far the un say that the voice of disabled people must be at the front and centre of this work and that the uk must actively consult and engage with disabled people and their organisation and give due consideration to their view in any legislation relate to these right therefore government amendment be significant step forward in remove those measure that be not consult on it also prevent the risk highlight in my speech last week on the previously propose eligibility criterion particularly on future recipient be also pleased that the minister confirm last week that the legislation on change to pip eligibility and descriptor will not happen until the completion of the timms review this lead to new clause be grateful for this new clause be select it be important to have debate on it as probe new clause and above all will be seek reassurance from the minister at the dispatch box that the government will get the detail of co production right be grateful that the measure in this new clause be co produce and support by disability rights uk and the spinal injuries association as well as through discussion with broad group of disabled people organisation and charity my new clause set out key measure to deliver on our excellent manifesto commitment to champion the right of disabled people and enshrine the principle of work with disabled people to ensure that our view and voice be at the heart of all we do far the measure in the new clause create strong link between the timms review and fulfil our equality act public sector equality duty along with the uk commitment to the un convention on the right of person with disability include the principle in article of the need to consult with and actively involve person with disability thus in this context meaningful co production with the disability inclusion taskforce as part of the timms review be essential commend my hon friend for her excellent speech both today and on second reading and for all the work know she have do behind the scene to get we to where we be today fully support her new clause which would guarantee meaningful engagement with disabled people before any change be make to pip as she know pip be also gateway benefit to carer allowance so do she agree that it be essential to include carer as well as disabled people in the disability co production taskforce do agree the minister will head up this review but the voice of disabled people must be front and centre the measure in this new clause emphasise the need for disabled people and disabled people organisation to make up the majority of the taskforce and to have significant role in the leadership of the review and believe carer could be part of that the output of this review must be meaningful and not performative therefore there must be mechanism to ensure that recommendation co produce in the taskforce come back to this house for full scrutiny debate and parliamentary approval before the legislation to implement the review outcome be bring forward that will ensure democratic accountability on those outcome include on how change to pip eligibility will impact disabled people while the new clause suggest that this should happen after month and ahead of any proposal on pip come out next autumn be aware that the minister be keen to ensure this co production process be not rush that be good approach be grateful for the fact that in his closing statement on second reading the minister acknowledge my call for target on close the disability employment gap that be the kind of approach know the government will develop as they bring forward their plan for employment support the significant change make to the bill since last week will shift the emphasis to enable disabled people to fulfil their potential and to close the disability employment gap they will anchor labour value of fairness in this part of the legislation rise to speak in support of amendment table by the hon member for leeds east richard burgon amendment in the name of the hon member for york central rachael maskell amendment in the name of the hon member for brighton pavilion siân berry and new clause table by the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell errol graham be year old grandad and former amateur footballer when bailiff come to evict he they find his emaciated body in freezing flat no gas no electricity and no food only two tin of fish four year out of date remain he weigh just four and half stone coroner rule that he have suffer death by starvation errol suffer from severe social anxiety the department for work and pensions know that and still cut off his only source of income as his daughter in law say he would still be alive he be ill but he still be alive his death be not tragic exception it be political consequence in jodey whiting take her own life after miss fit for work test while she be hospitalise stephen smith be deny benefit despite be gravely ill he die in these be not just name they be the human cost of decision make in this place decision that accord to sir michael marmot research contribute to over million premature death in england between and the pandemic drive by poverty and austerity today the government press ahead with more of the same clause of the bill will slash the universal credit health element the limit capability for work and work relate activity component from to just week by that be an annual cut of for over disabled people these be not people wait for an assessment they be people who the dwp have already find too ill to work people who can not feed themselves who live with degenerative illness and who experience daily pain confusion and incontinence and we be suppose to believe that this be about help they into employment even the government own figure show that few than one in new claimant will be protect by the so call severe condition criterion and charity such as scope the ms society and inclusion london have make that clear the clause will exclude huge swathe of severely disabled people especially those with fluctuating or progressive condition such as multiple sclerosis bipolar disorder and parkinson why because to qualify their condition accord to the bill must affect they not severely or overwhelmingly but constantly as scope put it it feel like it be design to cut support not to support people let we not forget the requirement for an nhs diagnosis in the middle of an nhs backlog crisis that exclude people with neurodivergent condition and other who rely on private or social care support this be deliberate narrowing of the safety net the result two tier system that punish people for try to work have variable symptom or fall through the crack of bureaucracy the severe condition criterion and the need for an nhs diagnosis exclude young people as well because their diagnosis and condition may not automatically transfer from their medical record as child to their adult record they would need another nhs diagnosis to move from the child dla to pip exactly those be among the concern about the requirement for an nhs diagnosis meanwhile what be the economic justification well there be not one as share of gdp working age benefit have not rise since other country such as france new zealand and australia invest more in their disabled citizen we have alternative for example we could have tax on extreme wealth just family in this country own more wealth than half the uk population accord to yougov three quarter of the public support tax on those with wealth of more than million yet this government will not tax the super rich instead they choose to take from those with arthritis cancer and chronic pain they just can not decide how much suffer to inflict while they squeeze the most vulnerable they have find billion for war and billion to raise defence spending and back endless foreign intervention money for war but not the poor the truth be this westminster be break but the real crisis be deep this government be not only out of touch but morally bankrupt they work for billionaire and big business while turn their back on disabled people they hold their summer reception at mastercard headquarters while disabled people be push to food bank they impoverish the sick and elderly to satisfy spreadsheet and then dare to speak of tough choice but the public see through this of voter believe that disabled people should receive support for basic living cost that be not niche opinion that be mainstream britain disabled organisation from disabled people against cut to disability rights uk be unite in their opposition to clause because if this cut be pass the consequence will be feel everywhere especially in our constituency surgery the email the letter the desperation the suffering all of it be avoidable vote to protect winter fuel payment and would do it again vote to scrap the two child benefit cap and would do it again will vote against these cut tonight because this be not just about benefit it be about the country we want to be do we want to be country that protect the vulnerable or punish they know which side stand on and know that speak for million across this country when say that we be not go to take this any more the two party stitch up be finish there be an alternative and we will be offer it begin by say how much respect the sincerity of colleague who believe that the bill will help address some of the difficult challenge that our country face know many in this house be motivate by genuine desire to improve life and ensure that our welfare system be fair sustainable and fit for purpose but have to say with the deep respect and regret that on this occasion think we have get this wrong yes the labour government have inherit broken system on multiple front and yes we need reform but we must be clear that reform can not mean push disabled people far into poverty it can not mean refer to cut as modernisation poverty have price tag and the cost shunting that will be involve in these cut will be plain to see in year to come and must be take into consideration support amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for stourbridge cat eccles which highlight the lack of value for money in the contract for assessment there be so many successful reassessment and appeal it be clear that we be not get value for money from these contract and that this be an expensive and ineffective model that ministers should look at if they be look for saving there be well way forward and that be reflect in many of the amendment that be support new clause table by my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell would ensure that any change to pip must be bring forward in primary legislation strongly agree with that give the lack of time we have have to debate and give proper scrutiny to what be before we today we should slow thing down until the recommendation be bring back to we so that we can have good quality debate and put well regulation and safeguard in place to prevent change that would worsen eligibility for those who be already struggle or at risk of poverty new clause table by my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball call for any review of pip to be ground in the principle of the un convention on the right of person with disability in sense be disappointed that such clause might be need but it point to the fact that we need more transparency independent oversight and crucially co production with disabled people there can be nothing about we without we and hope the government be listen on that new clause amendment table by my hon friend the member for york central rachael maskell acknowledge the fluctuate nature of some medical condition that can be unpredictable and debilitate the amendment would ensure that people with those condition be not leave vulnerable and that the process be responsive and serve its purpose of be safety blanket to those who need it most countless organisation have reach out to and many other to raise concern people with condition include multiple sclerosis huntingdon cancer and schizophrenia be concerned about how the change will impact on they their voice must be hear in this place the amendment do not block reform think they strengthen it they will ensure that the bill be evidence lead and root in fairness new clause seek to prevent people with indefinite leave to remain refugee and victim of traffic from access pip and element of universal credit although it be not shock that the opposition will use any debate as an excuse to have game of migrant bash be disappointed that those idea have make their way into this proposal what they will not tell the public be that most migrant in the uk be already exclude from access pip and universal credit because they have no recourse to public fund that restriction act as blanket ban on access to the social security system for million migrant be it really acceptable to deny access to pip or other social security to those who have spend year live and work in the uk pay taxis and astronomical visa fee and finally secure indefinite leave to remain base on their nationality rather than on their disability the new clause threaten the fundamental principle of our immigration system that those grant indefinite leave to remain should have access to many of the same right as british citizen there be well choice we can make and well way to find the money that we be tell we need to find we can scrap the outdated marriage tax allowance gimmick of the cameron government that still cost we million year we can close unjustifiable tax loophole such as the carry interest loophole use by private equity boss which would raise half billion pound we can apply national insurance to investment income raise over billion modest adjustment to the billion hand out in non structural annual tax relief would raise billion alone each and every year let we talk about those relief there be roughly tax relief in the uk his majesty revenue and customs have no idea what benefit of they bring to the public this be about choice we hear all the time about tough why be we not choose not to properly examine that billion of public spending while we tighten support for disabled people who be just try to live we can and should reform the system as ever my hon friend be make passionate case do she agree that for many of we our principled objection to the bill remain it will still balance the book on the back of the most vulnerable it will still bring poverty to our street will she join in my plea for the bill to be withdraw which be the good option for the government agree that be my plea to the treasury benchers there be still time to withdraw the bill and come back with something well these issue should be tackle head on it be unjust that because of the way we have build society each and every disabled person face in extra cost on average per month none of that be optional spending it be the unavoidable price of navigate society that be not design with disabled people in mind there be whole host of reason for that spending they be the non negotiable reality of have disability disabled people know well than anyone the barrier that keep we from work and what would help so listen to we non negotiable reality be that we have must economic growth to fulfil the government priority be it look after the poor or the disabled or any other priority yet under this government inflation have nearly double and their unemployment bill job tax and other measure have bring the economy to halt can labour members not understand that if they do not prioritise private enterprise and economic growth they will never be able to serve the most vulnerable who depend on that growth the most thank the right hon gentleman for interrupt at that point because have two suggestion that think would be good for growth the first be to ask the british investment bank to support disabled people in set up their own business as it do woman and those set up minority lead business know many adhder who would make great entrepreneur unfortunately sometimes they end up go down the path of criminality we should consider how we can ensure that their innovation be enhance and use properly the second suggestion be that we make our economy much more inclusive there could be national insurance contribution discount for take on someone with disability who may be in receipt of pip and may have be out of work for more than six month be sure that through more inclusive society we can encourage growth not discourage it have take up far too much time so will end with this disabled people know what be good for we we should be invest in people independence not leave they on the sideline or push they into poverty that be matter of justice but in the end it save money as well more than that it give people the dignity and freedom to live well that surely should be our purpose stand to support new clause and and amendment and among other which will mention as go through my speech promise to keep to the unofficial four minute time limit week after the cruel universal credit and personal independence payment bill and its arbitrary eligibility cut off be first discuss we be today be ask to amend and pass this deeply flawed bill in couple of hour of course it be now completely different bill from what be first introduce even the title will be change be not alone in welcome the removal of clause which mean that no one will lose vital personal independence payment so that the government can save some money however unlike other hon member do not believe that the uk government concession make the bill any more worthy to become legislation the government have concede that place an arbitrary cut off date on pip eligibility be unsupportable so why on earth do they continue to do exactly that for claimant of the health element of universal credit commend the hon member for leeds east richard burgon for amendment to amendment which would keep the health element of universal credit at for all new claimant rather than lower the rate for people who be unlucky enough to require that support after which will cause real hardship the joseph rowntree foundation estimate that without further change over disabled people will still face cut to their income of up to year by we do not know what datum have inform that approach or how it will impact on the great people of wales an assessment of the specific impact on wales have be necessary since the uk government first announce their welfare cut month ago now that their plan have change considerably that impact assessment be all the more crucial people in wales need transparency and certainty about how the change will affect their life in what function democracy do government bill get fundamentally alter in the middle of the first debate on that very bill and then elect representative be give only few hour to scrutinise it before it be pass we need time to scrutinise the bill fully and effectively we need time to co produce it with the constituent whose life it will affect this be chaotic and shameful state of affair especially in the light of the substantial impact that the bill will have on thousand of disabled people on the low income will the hon lady give way be just come to the end of my remark if the hon member do not mind be keep to my four minute time limit the bill should be scrap it be neither fair nor compassionate welfare reform it be not fit for our constituent will speak to amendment which table with the support of member from across the house it would ensure that if person have fluctuating condition such as parkinson or multiple sclerosis that be factor in consider whether they meet the severe condition claimant criterion have be work with parkinson uk and as the new chair of the all party parliamentary group on parkinson have hear concern from those live with the condition and their carer and family about the problem they already face in access support through the welfare system because of fundamental misunderstanding about the fluctuating nature of the condition those concern have be exacerbate by the bill particularly paragraph of schedule which state that in order to meet the severe condition claimant criterion at least one of the descriptor constantly apply someone with parkinson ms me or other similar condition may be able to carry out one of the activity in the descriptor such as walk for metre or press button in the morning but then not be able to do so by the afternoon under my initial reading of the bill that mean that someone with parkinson could never be severe condition criterion claimant because they would not meet the descriptor constantly thank the minister and his team for their extensive engagement with on this matter but the language use in the bill have cause concern and fear for those with parkinson as the minister have helpfully say and as he explain to prior to the debate much of the explanation that have receive centre around exist guidance that person must be able to undertake the activity in the descriptor repeatedly reliably and safely if they can not the criterion will count as apply constantly and they will be consider severe condition criterion claimant thank my hon friend very much for all the work he have do on this and for helpfully highlight that concern it might help if read briefly to he what the current training material for people apply the severe condition criterion say about what level of function will always meet limited capability for work and work relate activity although this criterion refer to level of function that would always meet lcwra this do not in any way exclude people diagnose with condition subject to fluctuation or variability the key issue be that the person condition be not subject to such variability that their function would ever be significantly improve from the lcwra descriptor identify hope that that together with my early intervention will give some reassurance to my hon friend very much thank the minister for his intervention which think will provide extensive reassurance to those with parkinson and other condition will keep watching brief on this measure as it progress and be aware that parkinson uk have today receive its own legal advice which indicate that the application of the measure might not be quite as clear as the minister intend my other concern be about the perhaps undue burden that the measure place on the guidance as well as the perhaps unfair position in which it put an assessor which could lead to an inconsistent application of the guidance my hon friend will know as do many member that my father in law die from parkinson two and half week ago so this be personal issue for both and my family and for many constituent who have write to in recent week regard their concern about the lack of clarity add my support to my hon friend call for clarity although be grateful for the minister intervention we must ensure that we get this right and get it right soon know that the thought of member across the house be with my hon friend and his family know what challenging time it have be and the fact that he have be able to carry on his duty extensively represent his constituent be to his credit and something that his family will be incredibly proud of as say the minister have be generous with his time and do not believe for moment that his intention be to restrict access to the severe condition criterion for those with parkinson those word from the dispatch box be incredibly helpful but ask he to ensure that he keep close eye on the situation as the hon member know sign his amendment but may caution he before he accept the minister very kind guidance will he clarify that it be guidance this be train documentation and it be subject to change it be not contain anywhere in the bill or the amendment so what the minister read to the committee be simply train guidance again understand from my helpful conversation with the minister that this be take exist guidance and apply it to law but understand the hon member concern my final point be to ask the minister to keep this issue under active review if any new evidence come to light to show that the primary legislation be act as barrier to the government position be reflect in reality hope he will consider opportunity to correct that in due course we all hope that the government clear intention that people with parkinson and other condition be in no way rise be happy to take one final intervention be grateful to my hon friend for take further intervention as signatory to his amendment wonder whether his discussion with the minister have include someone with condition such as relapse remit ms who can spend long period appear to be perfectly healthy but then have other period when crisis occur and they be debilitate by their condition will the provision that the minister describe be sympathetic to those sort of situation as my hon friend will know my amendment specifically mention ms and she and have have share friend who have suffer with that condition we must ensure that there be clear understanding of the reality of such condition on the ground so that when these provision be deliver in reality by assessor people be able to access the additional support that they need welfare reform be undoubtedly need after the mess of system that we be leave by the previous government but wherever possible we must ensure that the wording of the bill be as clear as possible we must ensure that those affect be in no doubt about what our intent be so that that be indisputable and we truly give effect to the intention behind the bill again thank the minister for his incredibly helpful intervention but we will ensure that the reality reflect the government excellent intention rise to speak in support of amendment over the past week have meet numerous disability organisation from parkinson uk to action for and hear directly from those live with complex fluctuating condition have also see the impact at first hand as an employer of people with long term invisible disability what have hear see and live be simple the current proposal risk unacceptable consequence for those who be already among the most vulnerable the government redefinition of severe condition hinge on the word single word that be of dubious clinical value appreciate the clarification give to other member but it be very late in the day to be get such important information condition such as chronic fatigue syndrome ms epilepsy and bipolar disorder do not operate on schedule they be unpredictable and they fluctuate yet the bill would exclude many individual who have they from vital support simply because their symptom do not comply with government definition amendment would ensure that our assessment system respect the united kingdom obligation under the un convention on the right of person with disability this affirm the principle of non retrogression so that we do not roll back hard win right it insist that we take invisible and episodic condition seriously and it protect people from fall through the crack the bill have have an extraordinary passage through parliament and at this point the most obvious course of action would be simply to pull it altogether and start again realise the political difficulty that that may involve but vulnerable people life be at stake when the government come to look again at some of the delete clause via the timms review it be essential to approach the issue from need first angle not how much can save angle because so many government cut in the past have end up cost more than they have save accept that the government do not have infinite fund but the pip proposal represent an arbitrary change in eligibility the four point rule with the crude objective of make predetermine saving it have all be the wrong way around we should wait to understand need first and only then consider to what extent the government can afford to meet they do the hon gentleman recognise that the concession that the government have bring forward and the amendment that be before we today ensure that we be get it the right way around it be explicit in the term of reference that the change be about fair and fit for the future assessment rather than to generate further saving so do he agree that the bill allow we to get the timms review do and to bring forward proposal after that can not agree with the hon member and will partly explain why in moment we need more honest assessment of the overall financial situation that be be use to justify these drastic cut because the wrong diagnosis lead to the wrong solution the dramatic rise in pip claimant be at least partly drive by other government policy perhaps one quarter of the rise be simply due to raise the pension age large number of people who be old and therefore more likely to be disabled have be push out of pension support into benefit support the state pension be pay out of current taxation not past contribution so the impact be immediate from the state point of view that switch be cost neutral in fact since state pension be usually much high than pip payment perhaps double then the state have make significant saving when we consider other factor such as greatly increase post covid nhs waiting list it be clear that the rise in pip demand while still significant worrying and worthy of attention have be overstate the hon gentleman mention the nhs and waiting list do he share my concern about the severe condition criterion and the requirement for the diagnosis to be make by an nhs professional in the course of nhs duty when people may not have access to that there be also requirement for the condition to be consider lifelong by nhs professional or health professional who may be unwilling to say that schizophrenia or bipolar disease for example be lifelong because they do not want to tie people down to that diagnosis yes agree that that be an additional concern the implication have be make both by this government and the previous one that much of the rise in claim be down to benefit chasing and people simply exaggerate their condition this be an assumption that need serious interrogation because it look to be substantially untrue for all these reason and more the good course of action would be to pull the bill now and to make fresh start deny adequate support today will only shift the burden tomorrow on to social care the emergency service and our already overstretch nhs we have be warn by the un not once but three time that our welfare system be fail disabled people amendment be chance to show that we be listen be concern about some of the amendment before we today in particular those that call for delay to legislation we be one year into five year of this parliament be go and the public need to see progress not far delay be mindful that minister have already do huge amount of heavy lifting to rebuild trust with disabled people and disability organisation since the election we should all recall that in july the department for work and pensions be under formal investigation by the equality and human rights commission for unlawful treatment of disabled people this government have make considerable progress since then in try to rebuild trust include through measure in this bill and link to it such as abolish the work capability assessment have be here for year some might say it feel like long but before enter this place campaign as the chair of the disability benefits consortium to abolish the work capability assessment know that disabled people and their organisation be grateful and thankful for the inclusion of that measure in the wide package that the government be bring forward although it seem to have be lose in some of the debate we have have on the subject be also mindful that in my own constituency the number of claimant for pip will rise in this parliament spend on that will continue to rise in this parliament and the universal credit claimant in my constituency will get an additional payment under this government plan which will be the first ever above inflation rise in universal credit there be much to gain and much that be support by disabled people and their organisation in the package that the government have bring forward particularly welcome the government commitment to support more disabled people into work we need to challenge ourselves little more in this place about some of the language of vulnerability be see automatically as vulnerable because of health condition or impairment be not in line with the social model of disability many disabled people find that patronising and offensive and we need to update our system just as we update our system thank to previous labour governments we have the first ever blind secretary of state in david blunkett now lord blunkett at time when the benefit system say that blind people be not require to participate in work relate activity the benefit system be not static beast it be an evolve creature that need to be update to reflect change in assistive technology medication and adaptation and advance in technology we must not end up with system in which people be write off and park in system because it be too difficult to get they into work that be not labour solution we be the party of full employment which must and should include disabled people if we be commit to disability equality and if we be the party of progress will chip in that this party take no lecture on what be progressive from nationalist whether it be scottish nationalist or the populist in reform we see the cost to disabled people of parking under the former benefit system and legacy benefit the long that somebody be out of work the more ill health that they experience include mental health and depression and the more cost that they incur for the nhs there be state benefit and individual benefit for get the right support speak from rather too much personal family experience my mum have schizophrenia and my dad have stroke in his he be tell by the jobcentre this be what you will get now basically sod off we do not want to see you and we do not expect to provide you with anything he find his own way back into work through go to university as mature student well not that mature at newcastle university and he graduate in the same year as we should look at the wide picture of full employment particularly welcome the government broad aim of reduce the disability employment gap which be deeply neglect for year and transform jobcentre from benefit administration centre they have be fail not because of lack of will or frontline staff some of whom be absolutely excellent but simply because the job they be give to do have change from be about support people into work to simply administer fail system that as we discuss early have the high fraud level ever see in the uk social security system think most of we believe that disability equality be measure not in the amount of benefit that individual receive but in the share opportunity and access to life chance open to all in our country be deeply mindful of that because while we have lost generation under the year of the conservative government and the lib dem coalition government we have previous government who be deeply committed to those issue that government publish report year ago today call improve the life chance of disabled people with an implementation and delivery date that be mean to provide those opportunity and equal access by sadly those coalition and conservative year set back the clock the report be still available to all those who want to see it and it talk about pathway to work and dedicated employment programme be necessary such as the new deal for disabled people those programme be largely demolish by the coalition it talk about the importance of the role of the nhs gps occupational health and rehab again labour government be now fix the wide nhs problem to make those aim and objective deliverable today the then prime minister strategy in the report commit to change the system so that it test functionality and ability to contribute rather than write people off again this government have have to come back to that after lost decade we have report year ago that talk about the necessity of well equipment system and the need to improve access to work something that minister be commit to today and be begin to transform with fast assessment process and by deliver the kit need the report also talk about the importance of engage with employer and the positive role that jobcentre plus could play in engage employer early in the process sadly we have see long delay in deliver those improve life chance but this be labour party back in government and try to deliver disability equality and improve the life chance of disabled people the measure in this bill be integral to that aim as say be concern about some of the amendment before we also have some concern that the bill need to go far in tackle barrier to work for disabled people such as the benefit structure include for those in support accommodation it be great that we have the right to try but more be necessary we also need to go bit far with employer include around reasonable adjustment and ensure that employer do not accept resignation base on ill health immediately but look at the package of support that might be necessary as well as work with they to tackle discrimination the federation of small businesses in particular which have do work on this issue previously would be really useful partner to have go forward rise before call the next speaker may remind all member that this be the committee stage can we have some focus on the amendment we be debate this afternoon not wide range third reading speech at this rate there will be little time for third reading rise today to speak in support of amendment and and new clause and without go into third reading speech it be important to highlight that we be debate bill that will have profound and in many case devastating impact on thousand of family across our country as the resolution foundation put it this bill represent an income shock for million of low income household that should give every member in this chamber pause what be particularly troubling be that the area hard hit be the very community that this government claim to support place in the north of england in wales and in my region of yorkshire these proud work class area be be fail by government tighten the purse string on the most vulnerable in dewsbury and batley of people claim personal independence payment have have more than constituent contact terrify about what these cut mean those be not just number they be real people with real need the universal credit health element be an essential lifeline for million of people in our country one of my constituent andrew waring run business before then covid leave he with long term organ damage he could barely walk metre and his pip payment become lifeline cut such support be not about trim fat it cut into people dignity and survival more than civil society organisation have urge mp to reject these cut even with the government amendment and the change introduce last week to defer any cut to pip until the timms review have conclude people be still leave concerned and in severe distress as it stand clause will leave people accord to the government impact assessment publish last night up to bad off by one in five people on universal credit and disability benefit have use food bank in the past month and this bill will just increase that number that be why support amendment table by the hon member for leeds east richard burgon to maintain the current universal credit health element that cut will especially hurt people with mental health condition who be already struggle to access support many member across the house have speak in support of the other amendment that also support and will not repeat their eloquent and informed speech and the point they make to conclude what have be disappointing at the end of my first year in parliament be to see critical bill which will impact million and million of people in our country rush through the legislative process in way that have not allow the relevant time to understand amend and improve it so that it be fit for purpose be sorry to say so but this process have be legislative mess just want to make gentle point to the hon member he point out that the process feel rush but sit here observe that there be not lot of demand to speak from member from any of the other party on the opposition benches just two conservative mp no snp mps and no reform mps do he share my disappointment be unable to comment on the people to whom the hon gentleman refer as absent be here to represent my independent alliance colleague all of whom strongly oppose the bill as it be present here today it will adversely impact million of people in our country the people at the bottom of the food chain the people who be struggle to feed their child heat their home get to work and keep appointment that be critical for receive treatment that enable they to manage their condition the hon member talk of the difficulty face by people with disability many million of those people be support by family member who be unpaid carer do he agree that although the government have say that they will work with disability group and people who have disability they should also co produce whatever come forward in conjunction with carer organisation do agree and repeat point that be make early by one of my colleague the timms review must include not just disabled people but disabled people of all age and also carer as say in my speech last week this change could potentially cut million from carer allowance for people who be care for disabled relative the large cut since the allowance be introduce in we urge the government to maintain that holistic view of the change and the impact that it will have the process of the bill despite the objection from labour members have be legislative mess what happen last week have be follow by today amendment which will basically gut the bill and focus the change on universal credit we have see last minute change rush timescale and lack of proper scrutiny disability be not choice need help be not failure this bill be not just bad policy it be betrayal urge every member of the house to reject it be keen to speak in the debate to share with hon member my own live experience of our current welfare system and to explain why support number of the amendment my dad work hard from the day he leave school at age right the way through to the age of he be an engineer he pay his taxis and contribute to society he never seek help from anyone throughout his life and he be proud of the work ethic that he stand for but on august out of nowhere he have life alter stroke overnight he completely lose the use of his left leg and leave arm his hand be almost always in tight fist and speech and memory become difficult although he have work for the same engineering company for more than year his employment contract offer little financial support and within just few week he be struggle to make end meet on statutory sick pay as family we have never hear of personal independence payment or of universal credit my dad do not want to apply but financial reality mean that we have no choice we find welfare system that be difficult to access it be confusing slow incredibly slow and at all time we find it frustrating and frankly dehumanising we spend month and month go through the pip application process and all the while no financial support be forthcoming and thing be tough very tough my parent be support by the local food bank they borrow money and get into debt have live difficult year follow his stroke fight against system that he have pay into for so long my dad die in january have struggle to get gp appointment he develop pneumonia he be place in medically induced coma during which time he have further stroke from which he never recover my dad like so many other be let down by the welfare system that be suppose to care for he and let down by the nhs at the end of his life give my background the house can perhaps understand why have find confront some of the initial proposal in this bill so difficult have see at first hand how debate in parliament and rhetoric from hon member impact on my own family and on my constituent particularly with regard to their mental health it be important that we recognise that disabled people so often feel that they be burden they feel that other think that their disability have be somehow manufacture and that they be benefit cheat disabled people be not burden it be our privilege to support they it have be say of late that labour be the party of work indeed it be but through that labour we have responsibility and duty to help other and it be important that these value be reflect in any proposal support the amendment table by my hon friend the members for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball for walthamstow ms creasy and for nottingham east nadia whittome which seek to ensure that those value be enshrine because agree that we absolutely should be do more to support disabled people into work obvious barrier exist particularly in more rural area such as my constituency where transport option be limited and suitable work opportunity be more difficult to find of course we should support disabled people into work but not by change the rule and make eligibility for benefit more difficult our public service be break and many of my hon friend have articulate well how bad thing be follow year of conservative failure it should be no surprise that welfare claim be rise it be the statistical inevitability of the state of our country in all the time spend advocate for my dad at dwp appointment medical assessment and work capability assessment would sit there and think what about the people who do not have someone fight on their behalf what hope do they have navigate the system be bad enough for our family what must it be like for other in our role as mps we all have responsibility to advocate for people who do not have voice if we want to reduce the welfare bill be sure we all want to do so we must do so by fix our broken system million of people be on nhs waiting list and many who want to work be not receive the treatment that would enable they to do so this government be make tremendous progress on improve our nhs and healthcare system and we need to give that time to bring about the change that we seek the welfare system be slow expensive and inefficient and it be riddle with private profit take advantage we must reform that tackle that and reduce those cost disabled people in this country have suffer disproportionately for year austerity and the last conservative government ruin life and people long for change narrative under labour they vote for that change last july if we be to move forward as country we must move forward together and that include disabled people rise understand that sir roger may already have make this point but about colleague be still wait to speak and we have roughly minute leave at four minute each most of you will get in if you choose to take eight minute each half of you will get in will allow colleague to make the decision as to whether they wish to help each other it be an honour to follow the hon member for south west norfolk terry jermy who be my constituency neighbour welcome and value his testimony and his authenticity of purpose in what he say wish to speak in favour of my new clause which be pleased to say have be support by many of my colleague represent both inland and coastal community my new clause would require the government to publish within six month of the bill pass an assessment of how its provision impact on coastal community such as mine in north norfolk that be really important because this bill could have huge and detrimental impact on such community and be deeply concerned that the government have once again fail to consider coastal community in their policy have hear from hundred of worried constituent and be sure that the same be true of my coastal colleague from across the house we all know that our area be too often overlook and not value enough by government my new clause would ensure that the government have to take account of how our area will be particularly harm by such badly think out change what be on the face of the bill as it stand will be really damaging to our coastal region even if we accept the government amendment some of the high rate of pip claim be in coastal community as be some of the high rate of unemployment considerably above average rate of sickness poor health and low quality of life be find in coastal community if the government press ahead with such blunt change without support more people into work first it could be catastrophic for community all around our coastline community who be eager to get into work be face with litany of barrier that the government be not do enough to solve we have real issue with public transport access so for many try to access inland employment it be either too far or too hard to get to many job or they see their pay packet eat into disproportionately by bus or train fare almost one in five unemployed people have not apply for job or have turn down offer due to problem with transport this problem be even more acute among young people both employ and not who be nearly three time more likely than their old working age peer to turn down job because they simply can not get to it these struggle extend to those access vocational training which can be new route into new trade and qualification that be simply not accessible for many due to the distance require or the lack of workforce to provide the training we have many talented people currently in receipt of pip or uc who would be eager to train for an industry that they feel could allow they to work but in community such as mine the opportunity be just too lacking we know that the welfare system be not work that be clear but the government have to stop look at this issue as mere number on balance sheet when the government do that and just look at way to get to magic number demand by the treasury they ignore the people behind the number there be an urgent need to tackle underemployment and in particular the rise in the number of young people with mental ill health be sentence to lifetime of worklessness but rip out the safety net will do nothing to help young people in coastal community such as mine who be three time as likely to suffer from undiagnosed mental distress than their inland equivalent in underprivileged area tewkesbury be not coastal constituency although once year at least it feel as though it be but my hon friend constituency share lot of the issue face by my rural constituency what he be get at and this be why will be vote against the bill be that it do not present the mean to get people back into work transport be one of the most significant barrier to that as hope he agree completely agree that that barrier must be address and the business case be so clear and easy to see the government should focus on support employment opportunity in our coastal community by invest in our tourism and hospitality sector support training and development opportunity and fix our break transport system yet again think many of these challenge might have be raise early if there be minister for coastal community in the government who could speak up for we the hon member speak with passion about coastal community and share that passion because also represent coastal community be pleased that some of the barrier he have highlight be in fact be address in my coastal community through the work there that have now be choose as trailblazer transport be one of those barrier and the organisation work in clywd north will break down transport barrier by find route and way for people to get into training and work and by pay for their transport as well know that the trailblazer be look to roll that out countrywide at the end of the process do he agree that thing can be do to overcome those barrier include in our coastal community look forward to the shareable case study from clywd north when it be available because thing can be do and doubtless they be be do but we need to be do they in every corner of the country and every coastal community around our country hope the government accept my new clause to force they to make real assessment of how area such as mine and that of the hon member will be affect by the proposal however still urge they to scrap these badly design change go back to the drawing board and come up with reform that will support not punish our coastal community today rise not just with heavy heart but with huge disappointment despite the concession make last week the bill remain danger to disabled people and it be not just bad policy but economically reckless when we take away essential support we do not reduce cost we shift those cost on to the nhs local authority unpaid carer and working class community despite the hard win concession this bill remain an assault on disabled people it be not strategy for inclusion or support it be calculated effort to slash funding and vital support from those of our constituent who need it the most accord to the government own impact assessment it will mean billion worth of cut which be set to cost around future universal credit recipient an average of each year by the bill will push people into poverty and will be disastrous for people already live in poverty be not elect as labour mp to take money out of the pocket of the poor and most vulnerable be proud to support amendment which would stop this cut new clause and amendment which would uphold right under the un convention on the right of disabled person new clause which would mandate the implementation of the timms review and new clause which would mandate human right analysis these amendment would mitigate the bad element of this deeply misguided bill but stand with every major disability right organisation and say that the bill must be scrap altogether the bill will devastate community like mine in liverpool riverside it will be one of the most affected constituency in the country already over people in the constituency nearly of our working age population rely on sickness and disability benefit to live with dignity have constituent contact daily express fear anger and despair hear from carer face destitution and from disabled people terrify of lose their last shred of financial independence these be people make impossible choice between heating and eating and between rent and medication disabled people feel vilify dismiss and forget their voice have be ignore at every stage of the process there have be no proper consultation no co production no scrutiny no compassion and no respect if ministers truly want to fund well social security system they could introduce fair wealth tax clamp down on tax avoidance put levy on bank and gaming or invest in inclusive employment support this be not reform it be sadistically cruel cost cut exercise it be betrayal of everything we labour politician claim to stand for for one will not stand by while this government strip away dignity security and hope from the people represent be not the only one who believe that other mp do too and the un be call for uk to pull the bill because it will deepen regression on disabled people human right will vote against the bill today because my liverpool riverside constituent deserve well disabled people across the country deserve well and the government need to do well for disabled people wish to speak in favour of amendment and and liberal democrat new clause and the bill have be an absolute shamble from the start there be no consultation with disabled people and there have be last minute chopping and change the timms review and the removal of the pip element of the bill be welcome but the process that get we there have leave disabled people in yeovil fearful and with little confidence in the government for example my constituent noel have unfortunately be unable to work due to degenerative condition he receive universal credit and have be leave deeply distressed by the propose change he visit my office almost daily for support he be not alone so many people in yeovil have make it clear that the proposal be just unfair the whole point of the bill as far as can tell be to get people back into meaningful work and lower the welfare bill thing that think we all want but at no stage have the bill do what be need to help get people back into meaningful work address the crisis in our nhs and social care system and our grow chronic health issue have constituent who would have end up homeless as result of the original proposal and now without full impact assessment we do not really know what effect the bill will have on our constituent be really concerned that people with parkinson and condition like ms will effectively be exclude as result of the criterion from the high rate of the health element of universal credit at the very least urge colleague to support amendment to address that the original bill be suppose to save around billion but the institute for fiscal studies predict that the amend version will deliver basically no saving over the next four year as over that period the forecast saving from reduce the universal credit health element for new claimant will be offset or exceed by the cost of increase the uc standard allowance what be the actual point of this bill my hon friend and neighbour constituency like mine be extremely rural he will know that the cost of deliver service in rural area be four to five time high than it be in urban area pip allow people to live independently both my hon friend and see integrate care board that be under extreme financial pressure we will end up pay one way or another we might as well give people the independence to live freely while we do it completely agree with my hon friend and neighbour we will see huge impact from icb have to make cut we be already see the impact in yeovil as hon member will have hear say the maternity unit have have its funding cut and be be shut for six month the bill be not produce with disabled people lot of its content be be remove there be no impact assessment and the bill be not likely to make any real saving this tell that the government should go back to the drawing board and either withdraw the bill or adopt the lib dem amendment and new clause that require proper consultation and impact assessment either way the government must stop make decision about disabled people without they thank some labour back benchers for have backbone and voting against their government in support of disabled people hope they do so again today rise to disagree with opposition new clause which would indefinitely block the provision of the bill be speak today not only as the mp for beckenham and penge but from personal experience as one of the few member of this house who have be recipient of the high rate of the disability living allowance and mobility allowance and have rely on motability car throughout my teenage year will speak to why the provision in the bill be so welcome and to the damage that the conservative new clause would do to it first this legislation and the wide debate we be have do not exist in vacuum the bill can not be separate from the impact of more than decade of savage cut to our nhs and community care service which have lead to what one nhs manager describe as medieval level of untreated illness in poor part of the country in particular community care have be decimate and attendance have almost double since this country now have the low life expectancy in western europe one of the high rate of preventable death among rich country and one of the low number of neighbourhood nurse and gps per head among wealthy nation the dismantling of preventive care have not only bring our nhs to the brink it have do more than anything else to drive the increase that we be discuss in the number of people who be on health relate benefit and who be disabled can speak to that from personal experience when be have an accident in which shatter my right hip it leave unable to walk for four year need nearly major operation on the nhs at the royal london hospital and the royal national orthopaedic hospital and when be sixth former become one of the young people in the country to have hip replacement when have my first hip replacement in the under labour government the average waiting time for hip replacement in britain be under nine week although thank to the staff at the royal national orthopaedic hospital be see even quick then receive excellent rehabilitation care with hydrotherapy every other day after year of conservative government the waiting list for hip replacement have treble from nine week to week that be up from two month to more than six month it be not uncommon in britain today to wait up to two year for hip replacement and rehabilitation service be non existent this situation be replicate for other treatment the nuffield trust note that there be an increase in wait time of nearly for respiratory medicine service under the previous government the ballooning of nhs waiting list and the list of people on health relate benefit go hand in hand so we can not divorce progress on the issue that we be discuss today from progress on the nhs we be already see great stride forward follow record investment from this government our nhs be on track to achieve target of of patient wait no long than week from referral to treatment there have also be investment in rehabilitation service such as hydrotherapy which be essential we must also understand this debate in the context of cut to other community and preventive service include programme such as sure start be very proud to have have the opportunity to work for tessa jowell who create sure start under the last labour government tessa understand the importance of child first day and design sure start as an early intervention programme which have significant and positive impact on the long term outcome for hundred of thousand of family and child in this country the programme be savagely cut by the previous government in one of the most short sighted and cruel thing that they do over year that have lead to increase hospital admission evidence show that young people who have access to sure start be more likely to be in very good or excellent health alongside this investment and the great progress that this government be make on health we also need to reform the dwp and the system around health relate benefit in this country that be why oppose new clause be so important today want to touch on what happen when person have have medical treatment and be look to get back into the world of work and also on the right to try which be in the bill in essence the bill say that try work will not trigger pip award review or work capability assessment the importance of this be bear out in research by the joseph rowntree foundation publish in november last year which say that almost three quarter of work relate disability benefit claimant whom it survey cite fear of lose benefit as significant or very significant barrier to work the right to try matter because people with disability or significant health condition often will not know what they be capable of do until they have try to do it they may not know what adjustment they will need to get back to work eight year ago be tell that would need series of operation on my ankle and knee follow by second hip replacement revision to the one that have receive decade early after this optimistically think that would be able to return to work five day week in the office as soon as could walk unaided be not able to do so it would take several month for to do that again be fortunate that have be with my employer for several year and have six month unpaid leave which allow to try and initially fail to get back to work however for anyone rely on support from the dwp today the reality be often very different we have perverse and inflexible system in this country which have be design to penalise and issue sanction rather than incentivise and provide support it be broken welfare system design by the previous government that be fail people it trap people by tell they that the only way to get help be to declare that they will never work again it create climate of fear fear that if they try to work they will lose their support this government be absolutely right to challenge and reform the system and be fully behind they do so if implement well the right to try will make really big difference to get people back to work and will go some way to dismantle the fear that surround the dwp for disabled people it be positive measure that will empower disabled people rather than patronise or infantilise they it have be campaign on for decade it be long overdue so be pleased to see it in the bill finally wish to touch on co production be pleased to see it in the bill but new clause would block it co production bring people together it lead to policy that be more person centre and effective and outcome that be more equitable and sustainable it be not only essential in all conversation about disability policy but particularly important when legislation pass through chamber like this one which so starkly under represent the voice and live experience of disabled people although disabled people make up of the population only of mp be disabled think everyone in this chamber have receive an print out of an election map have one in my office the top right hand corner of that poster list the woman ethnic minority and lgbt mp but it have never be lose on that there be no disabled mp include disabled people be marginalised minority who be so often overlook in every corner of public life as we look to reform our welfare system and the institution across society hope we will stick true to the principle of co production so that service and policy be design and implement in way that empower disabled people and meet their real need at committee stage we often table amendment to try to understand the nature of the legislation many question be be put forward in this concertinaed process the first be whether we should make policy by phone in rather than on an evidence base that be the only justification can see for new clause table by the opposition who appear not to understand that no recourse to public fund guide the life of many migrant in our community it contain fundamentally un british perspective on people who come here and work for many year in our national health service and who then have stroke or perhaps develop ms under the opposition proposal we would deny such people the support they have pay into as taxpayer it be dog whistle so loud that fear the dog in battersea right now be have terrible time we should not make policy by phone in but by evidence and pay tribute to the incredible word of my hon friend the members for south west norfolk terry jermy and for beckenham and penge liam conlon who bring their own experience to this debate will speak to new clause which table as well as to other amendment those amendment come from my experience of what make good policymake in this place and from my concern that we need to protect our constituent from the vagary of public policy think in particular of year old constituent of mine who be physically disabled with mobility condition call ankylose spondylitis will tell hansard how to spell that she work full time and live alone in rent flat that have be adapt for she remove mess around with and play with her benefit as this bill would do for million of people around this country will not save money it will simply cost more my constituent would struggle to get to work and to look after herself which she can do use the welfare support that she get under the current system that mean we will face high cost in the long run wish that member would learn from the evidence on the bedroom tax the bedroom tax be bring in under the same metric that we hear from the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart who be no long here that somehow people who be support by our welfare system be probably make it up this be not moral argument be make the bedroom tax do not save the money it be mean to save because it just push cost into other part of the public sector that be why it be so important that agree to new clause and weave the principle of the un convention on the right of person with disability into this legislation it should be guide by principle not prejudice in particular the principle that we should respect our fellow human being and our constituent who have disability new clause cover the question of co production and on this point be sorry that my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball be not in her place want to come back to that question because there be very important principle about co production that we have not bottom out and want to hear from the minister about it there be simple premise that we sign up to in the un convention which hope member across the house would support that there should be an adequate standard of living that be identify in article crucially article also set out that there should be an independent living process for our disabled constituent that be why in and indeed when the un criticise the previous government we rightly hold they to account for it what do we wish for our disabled constituent if not an independent and equal standard of living what do we wish for they if not the basic human right to be treat equally we must recognise that the world we live in do not work for they and we must account for that through our welfare system so that they can live freely and yes play part in the world of work while also live with dignity it be about very practical thing such as the freedom that come from someone have carer who help they get dress so that they can go to work that be support by our welfare system it be also about travel cost especially for those live in my constituency where transport for london seem to be hellbent on break down all of the station so that they be not accessible cover those cost mean that someone can go out to see family and friend there be also the food that someone might need if they have condition like phenylketonuria metabolic condition that mean person need low protein diet these be not equal experience but by use our welfare state to support those people we can have ensure that they have the human right we wish they to have new clause be about give due regard to the principle set out in the un charter so that benefit be calculate in way that mean they be sufficient to allow people to live life of freedom equally alongside their fellow human being the payment we make must meet those test so that disable people in our community can meet their living expense that be question that many hard work people who be struggle at the moment in their life can recognise well it be about level the play field it be not as the right hon member for beverley and holderness say about make fool of we all those be principle that hope the government will commit to weave throughout the legislation that be why new clause matter it go beyond the principle of co production which know the minister have recognise to the basic principle of how we treat people that would apply to the universal credit health element of the bill if we restrict benefit it would call on we to ask why we consider somebody to need amount at this point in time but amount in the future and to ask whether that will live up to the require standard of living want to touch on co production in particular many have talk about it but people do not necessarily understand what it mean it be not consultation co production mean that whoever be include can say no as well as yes without power of veto all we have be well manage consultation co production genuinely empower every participant to shape thing because they can walk out of the room as well as be part of it the minister have talk about seek consensus but it be not an equal relationship if disabled people be not give the clear power to veto what be put on the table such that the government have to work with they so that they do not use their veto that be the principle of co production that be why it be not consultation and that be what we should be seek have much sympathy for new clause be sorry that my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell be not in his place because be here in when george osborne use statutory instrument to slash the tax credit that our constituent rely on and million people be push far into poverty be also here when mps on both side of the house express frustration about the use of that process we have to watch the house of lords clear up our mess and stand up to the chancellor for use delegate legislation to take away from our constituent hope the minister will understand that this be not about this individual bill or even about his good intention know that he have engage with all of we it be about the principle that if we be to change the law we should be able to amend and adjust that law and scrutinise it on behalf of our constituent my hon friend the member for sheffield hallam olivia blake set out many alternative way in which we could switch spending to invest in order to save money in the long run there be many different way in which we can support our economy to grow it do not have to be off the back of our disabled constituent there be also the important principle here know many on the labour benches believe this that socialism be the language of priority our priority must be to empower and enable every single one of our constituent to achieve their potential and yes that happen through grow economy and also through welfare state hope that the minister will address the amendment that seek to ask question about how we get this right for many of we those unanswered question be troubling we can not bring back answer for our constituent because they tell we that we may not achieve those thing that have set out none of we who have live through george osborne and the bedroom tax ever want to go back to that again we want to be able to say to our constituent who might find themselves in the position of the father of my hon friend the member for south west norfolk that we can absolutely be proud of the system we be build today just as we be proud of my hon friend himself rise to speak in support of new clause and amendment be incredibly relieved that the government have listen most importantly they have listen to the people who will be affect by change to pip and take clause out of the bill the term of reference for the timms review have already be set without involve disabled people but there be chance with new clause to ensure that it move forward in truly co produce way what worry be that without the proposal in the new clause the bill highlight the need for co production but provide no assurance that it will be comprehensively do disabled people must feel that any change to the welfare system be make properly with they rather than do to they have walk in the shoe of family in my constituency bring up child with special educational need and disability for decade my son and have be catch up in the endless cycle of assessment mandatory reconsideration and tribunal that be situation familiar to many who have turn to the dwp for help to manage life with disability or disability this be the reason that so many disabled people be terrify of the government propose change the dwp be too frequently at war with the people it be suppose to protect too frequently it let down the most vulnerable in our community and it mostly get away with it recently the incredible joy dove win an eight year legal fight to link her daughter jodey whiting suicide to the stopping of her benefit which the dwp admit be mistake jodey avoidable death be not the only one dwp decision often seem to be completely arbitrary once when be wait to go into tribunal receive call from the dwp offering to reinstate my son benefit if drop the tribunal that experience cement in my mind something that believe to this day the culture of the dwp be hostile to disabled people that culture must change if we be to have any chance of build sustainable fair and compassionate welfare system for the future constituent of mine in scarborough and whitby suffer from variety of complex physical and mental health condition include ptsd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder anxiety disorder polycystic kidney disease and liver disease in may after report deterioration in his health he submit new evidence to support reassessment for high rate of pip which lead to the dwp remove his award entirely he be leave with no income or support despite his ongoing need for care this be the reality many disabled people who be turn down for pip rely on the health element of universal credit many of my constituent have fluctuate condition such as ms me and mental health condition the reality of their condition mean that during period of remission they return to employment however once their condition deteriorate they return to universal credit if that happen with this bill they would return on low level than before down to just week that completely ignore the reality face by disabled people and their experience of their condition without the protection provide for in amendment we would create two tier system where people with unpredictable condition would be value less than those with more predictable one urge hon member to support new clause and amendment also ask the government to please pull the bill even at this late stage let we get it right for the people who really matter let we get it right for disabled people rise to speak in favour of variety of amendment which will mention as go in the life of an mp not day go by without hear from constituent with an issue relate to benefit or health we can all think of the people we have meet who have suffer badly after year of austerity impose by the conservative party our sick disabled and vulnerable be leave trap in doom loop live hand to mouth and battle worsen mental health while fight broken system that fail far too many doubt many hon member in this chamber have personal experience of the cruel welfare system do first become ill at work with wolff parkinson white syndrome which be heart condition not long after suffer pulmonary embolism and almost lose my life that be follow by total mental breakdown punitive sickness policy mean be soon be manage out of the job love so much by human resource which refuse to acknowledge the recommendation of occupational health be in receipt of universal credit for about year receive month but that do not even cover my rent and bill and be at risk of lose my rent home thankfully have friend and family to support but not everyone be that fortunate my confidence plummet and the feeling of failure rejection and uselessness at not be able to sustain myself be all consuming nobody choose this life in fact just yesterday the united nations write to the government state that the rhetoric language and false statement use when discuss welfare be damaging as well as raise concern about human right violation be pleased that clause be pull from the bill but it be still totally unclear what will happen with pip and when and more importantly when mps will be able to scrutinise and debate the proposal will there be vote follow the timms review it be imperative that member have oversight of the outcome of the review before any implementation failure to do so could lead to measure be pursue that many member have be oppose to all along for these reason be support new clause in the name of my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and new clause from my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball be also glad that the government be scrap the propose freeze to the universal credit health element however it will remain for future claimant potentially deepen poverty for ten of thousand of people and create another two tier system the severe condition criterion be welcome but it do not include fluctuate condition such as parkinson ms or me and nor do it cover cancer for those reason will be support amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for york central rachael maskell amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for isle of wight west mr quigley and amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for leeds east richard burgon in my constituency of stourbridge many people have thank over the past few day for vote against this flawed bill last week not just disabled people and their family and carer but charity worker work coach nurse and local authority staff nobody support this bill not deaf and disabled people group not charity and not health organisation not even the united nations support it let be clear the system need reform and none of we disagree that it need to change labour campaign on that promise in our manifesto and be proud to tell voter on the doorstep that we would be fix social security and make it easy for people to claim but the bill before we do not do that colleague it do not have to be this way there be alternative in fact on social medium this week my hon friend the member for nottingham east nadia whittome list no few than option to raise fund and my hon friend the member for sheffield hallam olivia blake have raise more such point in her speech today will offer some more as per amendment table in my name we should stop outsource health assessment to five private profit make company seven in assessment be go to mandatory reconsideration and tribunal at the dwp expense there be lack of cohesive strategy with assessment be carry out by all manner of staff with wildly varying experience and background although that amendment have not be select for decision be grateful to the minister for recognise the need to have this discussion about how we can do thing well with the nhs year plan launch want to see the dwp work closely with the department of health to utilise digital technology to link health record with dwp record and reduce the burden on applicant to provide evidence of their illness let deploy mental health taskforce to drive down waiting list many people on long term sick leave be await mental health treatment or diagnosis the secretary of state for health set up taskforce for elective waiting list at my local hospital trust and it have be hugely successful in reduce waiting time let apply the same strategy to mental health go back to the united nations briefly the uk still have not meet un obligation to tackle offshore tax evasion lose billion for the exchequer every single year million of pound of covid fraud have still not be recoup and let not forget that his majesty revenue and customs write off billion in unpaid tax last year there be plenty of option to make saving we just need the will to do it will end by tell the house about friend bump into just last weekend my friend harry be walk with crutch and tell he have recently be hit by car fracture his ankle neck and skull and herniate disc in his back when his head be scan at the hospital doctor discover brain tumour which have now be remove harry be still wait for the result of that surgery but be struggle with his memory and speech as well as recover from his injury see harry remind that this could happen to any one of we at any time this bill affect everyone one in three of we will become disabled at some point in our lifetime and while some may not need the system many will want it to be there for my family friend and constituent to ensure that no one be leave in poverty seventy five per cent of universal credit health claimant experience material deprivation and already live deep in poverty do not come here to make people bad off and that be why still can not support this bill today will speak to the government amendment and against some other amendment before be elect work for the trade union unison where be the national officer for disability equality in that job see every day how disabled people who love their job be often push out of the workplace by employer who refuse to make the small change that would help they to thrive at work through the mayfield review this labour government be seize the opportunity to finally make the workplace more accessible for disabled people the employment rights bill will bring in flexible working allow disabled worker to perhaps start little later in the morning when tablet have kick in or to work from home to avoid the painful morning rush hour alongside that have also introduce my own bill for deadline for employer response to reasonable adjustment request from disabled worker we be transform the workplace for disabled people and labour be also make work pay no long will it be choice between benefit and bargain basement job we have increase wage for million low pay worker commit to introduce mandatory disability pay gap monitoring and deliver the big upgrade to worker right in generation government new clause and associated amendment will ensure that for those who can not work their universal credit health benefit will increase in line with inflation the bill end the absolute indignity of constant reassessment for those with severe condition almost family in ealing southall will also see the basic rate of universal credit increase by record amount lift thousand of child out of poverty across the country new clause would rob those family of that money it must be reject it can not be right that almost million people be off work long term sick million young people be not earn or learning and thousand people day be apply for pip we be an outlier internationally no other country in the world see the same massive increase in people on sickness relate benefit it be unique to this country and we do no favour to people with long term condition by ignore it the tories create this broken system where people be well off on sickness benefit than in work and there be no help for those who want job everyone know the system need reform but amendment amendment from the chair of the select committee my hon friend the member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams conservative amendment to and new clause would continue to put reform on the long finger and delay change last august after year of the tories when visit west ealing jobcentre and ask who could speak to if be disabled person who need job that would work around my need be tell there be no one no one at all that be why we need change now under labour west london be one of the get britain work trailblazer across the country people on long term sickness benefit with back pain and other musculoskeletal condition which be the second big reason why people claim health relate benefit have be contact and ask if they want help to get job and hundred have reply that they do they have be sit there wait for we to contact they those people be ignore by the previous government people who want to work but be leave on the scrapheap some million from the government be help west londoners into work the bill be part of much big billion plan to extend that to every jobcentre and to every disabled person who want good job the new right to try will build more flexible benefit system that do not force people to put themselves in box lock out of work for ever but allow they to try work without lose benefit be glad that the government have ensure that no one on pip will lose it and that they will co produce the pip review with disabled people it have be over decade since the pip system be last review and since then we have learn more about the impact of mental health condition and fluctuate condition but true co production mean let the review go ahead without this house try to control it so we must reject the rigidness of new clause and in favour of true co production disabled people be let down again and again by the previous government labour be finally deliver equality for disabled worker while fix the broken system that force almost million people to languish on long term sickness benefit without help if colleague across the house genuinely want reform that build well more flexible benefit system that make work pay take child out of poverty and properly support disabled people who can not work they must do more than just talk about it they must vote for the bill and get on with the job of change britain for the well rise to speak in support of new clause and amendment and the bill more broadly this informed debate have be conduct respectfully throughout the entire process it have be illuminate to hear from so many member with such in depth personal familial and professional experience urge those on the government front bench to look upon such member from across the house as resource because they speak with great authority mention in particular the speech by my hon friend the members for stourbridge cat eccles for south west norfolk terry jermy and for beckenham and penge liam conlon which be so informative may correct one early comment we hear from one opposition member that no recourse to public fund mean recourse to public fund well the clue be in the descriptor know that boris johnson struggle with that but no recourse to public fund mean exactly what it say wish to speak about the impact be the house to pass amendment recognise that the amendment adopt some of the previously announce concession and somewhat limit the damage of clause but let be clear even with the amendment the clause be not acceptable the bill be not welfare reform it be cut deliberate far reach and deeply damaging even after amendment clause will remove billion from disabled people in the year ahead three quarter of those affect be already in material deprivation around individual people who be too ill to work stand to lose an average of year member must consider today which constituent whose door they knock on will find themselves year bad off the weekly top up for those too unwell to work which be currently will fall to for new applicant the same condition and need as current claimant but half the support that be not fairness it be the creation of two tier welfare system we be not talk about abstraction we be talk about people who can not walk metre or who need constant supervision or who can not operate keypad unaided they currently receive per month soon some could receive as little as per month that be not budget decision it be moral one the direction be clear and it be backwards minister claim that by the bill could lift people out of poverty but respected economist and think tank have call that projection misleading it be base not on current law but on hypothetical tory policy that never materialise how on earth can we claim credit for something that the conservative party do not implement it do not stand up spin will not shield the government from the consequence because as we know perhaps half million future claimant live in material deprivation must be prepare to live on less depend on how we vote today the delay to pip cut be welcome but the same delay must apply to universal credit why rush to take from those who be too unwell to work without fully understand the consequence why again be disabled people be exclude from the conversation we have hear the most eloquent contribution about the true nature of co production and we must caution against process whereby people opinion be hear and listen to and then blithely ignore if we be to embrace that there be amendment and new clause that we should embrace note that the un committee on the right of person with disability have write to the government and urge that welfare reform must not disproportionately or adversely affect the right of person with disability to independent living think we have to pause and take on the enormity of that intervention from the united nations we have be tell by scope the ms society and more that the bill fail to take account for disability if they be progressive or fluctuating that be why support amendment table by my hon friend the member for york central rachael maskell and similar amendment hear the minister come to the dispatch box and give we some assurance about note for guidance but respectfully point out to he as true trade unionist would say that the word be the word and the schedule to the bill make it abundantly clear that the descriptor have to apply constantly and will do so for the rest of the claimant life include for specific mental illness that the claimant will have for the rest of his or her life we hear great deal about encourage people to try work that be not in the bill but it be in the regulation that be laudable implore the minister to think this through if the bill remain as write it will discourage people from take up that opportunity to prevent that we should endorse and embrace the amendment table by my hon friend the member for york central government who claim to care about fairness can not proceed like this one amendment table by the conservatives seek to strip foreign national of the right to claim benefit that could mean that some people be leave with no support whatsoever which could include my father who have be in this country for year and pay into the system the amendment table by the conservatives be absolutely despicable and invite the hon member to join in agree with that statement the hon member make powerful point we have to raise our head and look at our brother and sister who be actively and economically engage in our country and think about the contribution they make and the payment they make into the treasury through tax and national insurance we must treat they with dignity and respect rather than try to other they at every opportunity the hon member make an incredibly powerful and tell point about the disincentive of try to get into work for people who have vary and fluctuating condition such as ms that be an unanswerable point and will listen with interest to what the minister have to say in response do he agree with that in conversation that the minister have with what we be too lazily inclined to refer to as the disabled community unless we be able to break down disabled group into those who have permanent condition and those who have fluctuating condition and to individually tailor response to that it will be miss opportunity to get this right the hon member make an important point and it be critical that that be reflect on the face of the bill with all sincerity we can not walk away from here think that guidance note be enough they may change fundamentally in further iteration and say something completely different from what this honourable and decent minister be say to we today policy for disabled people must be make with they not impose upon they if we be serious about end austerity we can not keep balance the book on the back of the poor that mean revisit not just what we spend but who we tax and how we have hear about the party of millionaire make their case that this country have do so well by they they be so privileged to have make success of their life and to have flourish that they be look at the opportunity they be give and say please we can make further contribution it be they who make the argument about wealth tax that would raise billion nigel lawson when he be chancellor think that the differential between capital gain tax and income tax be an anathema and he equalise it so there be opportunity for we there the employment rights bill also present we with wonderful opportunity if we could grasp the issue of single status of worker and deal with the issue of bogus self employment limb employment zero hour contract and the rest of it that not only represent secure well pay unionised work for people to give they flourish life it also give we the opportunity to collect currently uncollected tax and national insurance to the tune of billion per annum that would also mean support people accord to their need that be not marx but the act of the apostle this be moment of reckoning the country expect well if we be to lose our nerve now we will lose more than vote we will lose the trust that bring we here we must reflect that during our discussion about the bill each and every one of we have hear the response from our constituent and our office that this have be shamble there be no other word to describe it now be the moment to stop the cut and implore the government to rethink the bill rise to support my new clause as well as number of other amendment table by my right hon and hon friend include new clause new clause and amendment welcome the concession that the government have make to the bill which will be support pay tribute to the disabled and chronically ill people whose tireless campaigning lead to those concession have be proud to stand with they however the change do not alleviate all my concern about the bill one in three disabled people be already in poverty the bill even after the government amendment would take around year from the disabled people of the future at time when the extra cost of be disabled be set to rise by in the next five year the government analysis state that the measure in the bill will lift people out of poverty however analysis from the joseph rowntree foundation and the new economics foundation show that they would actually push disabled people into poverty we know that benefit cut and loss of payment help to trap woman experience domestic abuse make child grow up in poverty and even cost life like that of my constituent philippa day who die from deliberate overdose after her benefit be wrongly cut this be particularly pertinent to those with fluctuating condition who risk lose lcwra status during period of temporary improvement that be why amendment be so vital as it would ensure that they be protect even with the government concession not single disabled people organisation support this bill it be at the request of the disabled people organisation forum in england that have table new clause which would require the government to publish human right memorandum before the bill can be enact no analysis of the impact of the bill on the human right of disabled people have be publish so far last year the un find that there have be further regression in the grave and systemic violation of disabled people right in the uk which it report on in last night the un write to the government to say that it have receive credible information indicate that the bill will deepen that regression we should not proceed with the bill as it stand disabled people organisation remain sceptical about the timms review into pip be hopeful that the government will support the amendment table by my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball which would make provision for commitment around co production and oversight they must also support new clause which would ensure that change from the timms review be introduce as primary legislation that be essential in ensure democratic scrutiny otherwise mp will not be able to amend or vote on the legislation it would also prevent reduction in eligibility for pip which we know would be disastrous and which motivate so many of we on the government benches to call on the government to think again join the labour party because of what experience and witness grow up as child and teenager under the conservatives as disabled mp have first hand experience of the disability benefit system we have all meet constituent who be already not get the support they need the question today be this do we let their number grow if the answer be no urge member to support the amendment that would strengthen protection for disabled people and ultimately to vote down this bill rise to call for the removal of clause and from the bill because think they get to the heart of the unfairness contain within it there can be no doubt for those of we who be here last week that trust be erode between the government and disabled people organisation that trust will need to be slowly rebuild over the come month we should therefore recognise that positive step in that direction be the government decision to pause on the issue of pip reform and to place those decision in the hand of the timms review however that be not enough because the bill still contain proposal to cut billion from the universal credit health element for more than future claimant from next april we will have create two tier benefit system base not on health need but on the date when claim be make in fact there be already nearly million disabled people live in poverty today across the country that be damn indictment of our welfare system and should be wake up call to bring that number down not to make it go even high the number be stark take year or month from disabled people income will force family to crisis point and into further reliance on food bank the joseph rowntree foundation claim that if the cut be not remove an additional people will be force into poverty even before this cut three quarter of all universal credit health element recipient be already experience material deprivation and be unable to afford the essential on which to live if we be serious about genuinely reform the benefit system and put disabled people and their organisation at the heart of any change can not see why the health element of universal credit would not also be part of the timms review if we be honest it be not good practice as we see last week to make long term social policy in rush or in vacuum all part of the benefit system include the universal credit health element need to be consider without that we do not have complete picture of the system or the challenge that disable people face one of the fear of disabled people organisation be that the funding envelope for reform be still the same and the timms review will simply look at different way to achieve the same financial end can the minister clarify whether the review start with target for how much money it must save or whether this be genuine attempt to redesign the system so that it benefit everyone even if it end up cost more be my hon friend aware that of those claim the health element of universal credit use food bank last year or that third of those who claim it could not afford to heat their home last year that intervention be further evidence that our welfare system be not work understand that some member may consider vote for this bill tonight because of the propose uplift to the standard rate of universal credit disabled group that have meet be clear that that be not worth have if it be to be do at the expense of other disabled people far down the line member will have see the letter yesterday from the un committee on the right of person with disability which have raise serious concern that the bill will deepen the sign of regression in disabled people human right the answer therefore remain that clause and of the bill need to be remove we should allow the timms review to look at all aspect of the benefit system and report back next year that be what disabled people and their organisation want and that be what will vote for last week vote against the government because be not happy with the proposal on the table when the bill be initially put forward be particularly concerned about the propose change to pip eligibility criterion which in my view be arbitrary and risk take support from those who need it most be glad to say that the government have listen and act as result of government amendment which will remove change to pip eligibility alongside make other positive change can now carefully and with reservation support the bill as amend the removal of change to pip eligibility criterion from this bill protect carer and prevent the consequential loss of carer allowance as former carer that be important to have put lot of thought into this issue over the precede week have listen to my constituent and have be think about what be important to they not only have the amendment remove the change to pip that be worried about but the bill will now include vital increase to the basic level of universal credit do not feel able to vote against that today we inherit heck of mess from the last conservative government and do not think anyone disagree that there be need for change we need system that be well design that work and that be fair to both claimant and other taxpayer so welcome the ministerial review of the pip assessment co production with disabled people and the organisation that represent they be particularly welcome conduct thorough review in genuine co production lead to well think out proposal for reform be the right thing to do with the great respect the hon lady be put the cart before the horse as be the government you do your review first you find out what it say and you tailor your policy and your response to it be that not the good way of make policy this half bake idea satisfy no one think the hon gentleman have miss the bit where the government be take out clause and the measure on the pip eligibility criterion and be do the review first but thank he for his intervention will hold the government to account for their promise about the review also endorse the comment of my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball and support her new clause this debate have involve huge raft of different issue and they have be conflate at time so before talk about the other change that support want to emphasise that pip be not just an out of work benefit it be claim by people both in and out of work and it be there to help with the extra cost associate with disability and long term condition however there be also huge disability employment gap and great many people who want to work can not simply for lack of bit of support some health treatment or an employer who will make reasonable adjustment be therefore pleased that plan for employment support have be bring forward and that there will be extra investment early should make it clear that my concern always focus on small part of the broad reform package but for reason of time will not go into they these be vital step towards fix the system will not say that have no concern leave have which be why support amendment table by my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie but no policy or solution will be perfect no green paper can address everything and no legislation can get everything right in these past few week have be remind of something that my friend joe once say to politic be not game to be play it people life and people live matter no wonder our constituent have so little faith in our political system when what should have be debate about the right and wrong of policy and about the life of those constituent have turn into debate about the westminster bubble not the people we serve the westminster bubble ought to be pop and quickly the view of the house have be make clear over the last couple of week and be glad that the government have listen will always speak out as know my colleague will without fear or favour and we will always fight for well fairer welfare system for everyone rise to support the removal of clause and the associate amendment and to comment on few other amendment base on what have read and learn many thing have be say in this debate in the chamber and outside but it be undeniable that the system be not work for far too many people we see welfare bill rise people trap on benefit and opportunity lose the most heartbreaking part of all this be not the monetary cost which we seem to talk about too much but the cost to people of be write off and spend lifetime in fail broken system we all hear story every week through our casework and in our surgery of people who want to work but do not have the necessary support of the intrusive nature of assessment of bureaucracy that need human touch of people fear to try work for fear of lose their benefit and of disabled people who need more support one of my hon friend who be no long in the chamber speak about the broken social contract while we approach this debate and this subject with the compassion and care that be need we should also be clear that the social contract be already break there be nothing honourable about deny or slow down action to tackle the problem of million people be throw on the scrapheap for be sick or long term sick there be nothing to cherish from the conservatives who leave this government legacy of nearly million young people throw on the scrapheap not in employment not in education and not in any meaningful walk of life no one can say that the system be not break and that be the spirit in which many of we in this chamber have seek from different perspective to approach this legislation want to speak against amendment that seek to delay or wreck this bill because whatever happen next we need to get go one of the criticism of this government that sometimes hear be that we do not move fast enough now that we have start to fix our broken welfare system we be be tell by some that we be go too fast think we can move forward with bill that begin to fix the foundation of our welfare system and do so with compassion for those most in need and welcome contribution that we have hear today also welcome the fact that minister have listen to our concern about the bill and decide last week to remove clause because it cause anxiety not just to member of this house but to many people outside who see the risk bring the timms review forward before any change be make and commit to fully involve disabled people and their organisation be the right thing to do the government have listen recognise many of the point make in passionate speech and support new clause table by my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball hope the minister will address that and assure the house that the sentiment have be take on board because the new clause will make the bill well not bad and clear the fog it be important that we push ahead with this bill as colleague have say work be central to labour mission because dignity come from good work and from employer who embrace their employee and give people the ability to work there be no dignity in allow million people to be throw on the scrapheap with no ability to get off it recognise exactly what my hon friend be say because both my parent be force out of work they be unwell and could not get the support they need from the nhs they could not get foot in the door of the social security system and as their health get bad they get far away from the workforce wish that we have have well support for they do my hon friend agree that it be positive that the government be open to set disability employment target which could drive action in my constituency of bournemouth east the rate stand at an unacceptable after year of the conservatives thank my hon friend for his comment he make powerful case for why our job today be to fix the bill not kill it we should be passionate about the centrality and dignity of work unemployed young people in my constituency and those who be disabled be frustrate by system that do not work and they want the government to work with they to fix it that mission be true year ago when the post war attlee government be elect to pick up the piece follow the devastation of the second world war similarly our government mission today be to fix the foundation of broken welfare system and broken economy as say on second reading be particularly concerned about the impact of the welfare trap on young people represent city with one of the high level of this be horrible phrase young people who be neet or not in employment education or training and who be start their adult life on benefit we know that the trend have not be help by the failure of the mental health system and the health system which have put pressure on people without offer they any help or support to get they through be passionate advocate of apprenticeship it can not be right that so many young people in peterborough and around the country be start their adult life on benefit and agree that we should not be pay benefit so that young people can stay at home we should be invest in young people ability to earn learn and train hope the minister will expand on those point when he come to respond to the debate because it be morally politically and economically right that young people should be earn and learn and it be right that we proceed with this bill follow the removal of clause be content that this bill begin the journey of fix the system it be the start not the end but it be start we need to make rise to speak to the many amendment that attempt to improve this bill which sign in desperation because do not enter politic to strip vital support from those who need it yet the bill do exactly that we be the party that create the welfare state so we know the welfare state be not handout sadly the debate on this bill have characterise it as such but lifeline propose to take that lifeline away from anyone who may need it be betrayal of those we be elect to serve while welcome the government step back on some element of the bill do not believe they have go far enough as it stand billion be still set to be cut from hundred of thousand of sick and disabled people who be already on low income which can not be right that be why be pleased to support amendment to amendment which appear in the name of my hon friend the member for leeds east richard burgon to scrap the cut to the universal credit health element entirely we have to realise that disability right organisation still do not support the cut at all the impact assessment that do exist be inadequate or worrying and thousand will still be push into poverty in truth the announcement of the timms review do little to quell my fear this government lead review will take place after the bill take effect whether or not the review be co produce the government will be take support away from disabled people and then consult they on their view after the fact the toxicity around the bill mean that it be be criticise by those whom it be mean to support and that be really not good start while be pleased that the point element have be remove from the bill still share the concern hold by many disability right group about what the bill will truly mean for disabled people that be why have sign my name to amendment that will go some way towards make the bill somewhat more humane amendment which appear in the name of my hon friend the member for york central rachael maskell would protect those with fluctuate condition new clause in the name of my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball would fix concern about the timms review by ensure it be follow by primary legislation and by mandate its implementation and co production with disabled people other amendment that support include those to protect carer and to ensure that due regard be give to the un convention on the right of person with disability we would be wrong to ignore the un warning that the bill will worsen the right of disabled people we have to remember that pip allow many disabled people to access work cut support do not incentivise work but prevent it the claim that these reform would have boost employment simply do not hold up let we not forget that the bill be publish three week ago and be gutte on second reading with further week to rush it through parliament that be no way to legislate on matter with such serious consequence we have health crisis in our nation especially in respect of mental health and the answer be not to take financial support away from those who need it if we want to reduce the number of people off work due to physical or mental ill health we have to continue to address the issue in our healthcare system and get on with the plan to allow people to access appointment and assessment to stop their ailment worsen this be not how welfare reform should be carry out and even at this late stage urge the government to throw this bill out some may say that that would be mad but surely it can not be bad than what we have be do this week we have to be frank about why the bill be introduce it be primarily about save money but it would balance the book on the back of the sick and disabled be really tired of how we talk about the economy and about growth in this house as though this be household bill and we can cut this or cut that no one seem to ask good economist and find out that we be mean to invest for growth people keep tell that be young which be patronise and it be not even that true any more but still can not find anyone who can give an example of time in history when cut to public service or welfare have solve the issue of the day that be the case again and again and those discussion need to end there be many other way in which we can save money as many member have point out we could end tax loophole or have wealth tax be pleased to add my name to amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for stourbridge cat eccles which would scrap third party pip assessment us multinational be make million of pound out of those assessment while humiliating people get it wrong we be tell that all this be about get people into work but just can not see how we can continue to hold on to that idea reiterate that it may seem bad to drop the bill at this late stage but it can not be bad than the debate we have have over the past couple of week sometimes politic seem complicated sometimes the passage of bill through parliament especially with antic and shenanigan like those we see last week may confuse people but actually the issue before all of we when we vote tonight be very simple today wednesday july be labour mps go to vote through cut to universal credit that will take billion from sick and disabled people who be already on low income people who will have be judge not fit to work will we put our name to bill that will on average take off every single one of those people think that if we have not have the complication with the bill the week before labour mp would find it very easy they would see bill that ask we to take billion of pound from low income people in our constituency across the country and find it very easy to vote no ask my friend on the labour benches to cast their mind back to when they be first select and first elect none of we get into politic to take year off low income people who be sick and disabled and on universal credit it have be say that what be morally wrong can never be politically right people outside this chamber see the issue before we very clearly indeed the bill be be railroad through disabled people voice be be exclude and when colleague say do listen to those who say we should press on that mean do listen to disabled people think we should listen to disabled people and not one disabled people organisation support the change the reason the bill be be rush through committee of the whole house rather than committee where disabled people and their organisation people with live experience could talk to the mps on the committee be because of politically impose artificial deadline that be there to save face welcome the change make last week as result of pressure from disabled people and back bench mps but we be vote tonight on take money off people on low income we be vote tonight on whether we think after say last week that it be wrong to have two tier pip system that it be right to have two tier universal credit system the reality be that people will remember how we vote tonight it have be say before but will say it again some vote define we they define we as politician and they define how we view our time in parliament disabled people who come to see we in our constituency surgery will not understand if we as labour people vote for this cut to universal credit tonight or abstain we will live with that vote in every single constituency surgery between now and the next general election let we take step back and imagine that we do not have whip system in this house of course all of we agree on of thing all the time that be the reality but if this be not whip vote think the vast majority of labour mps would vote with their conscience and with their disabled constituent against cut universal credit all the rest be sophistry we will live with this vote it be often say that the long the statement on twitter from an mp after vote the bad the decision they must have make you start at the first sentence and by the time you get to the end the constituent be think do they do they really vote for that after all they say on the tv in their tweet and in the chamber we be labour people this be not left and right issue in the labour party this be right and wrong issue say this any labour mp who vote against these cut to low income people on universal credit tonight will sleep soundly know that they do all they could on odd year to stand up for their disabled constituent that be what we get into politic to do we should not plough ahead we should vote this out call the final back bench speaker david pinto duschinsky after which will call the liberal democrat spokesperson rise to speak against amendment to amendment amendment and and new clause the creation of the modern welfare state by the labour government remain one of our proud legacy at its heart be the powerful idea that people should be protect from hardship and support to realise their full potential underpin that vision be clear principle everyone who can work should work not just for the dignity and agency work bring but because it be the most effective route out of poverty child in workless household be five time more likely to grow up poor than those in household where every adult work that principle hold true today but it be under strain one in working age people be out of the labour market among young people that figure be one in eight this be not global trend but challenge unique to the uk root in the welfare system design too often that system lock people with health condition and disability out of work too often it penalise attempt to get ahead and fail to offer real support too often it write people off disabled people in the uk have an employment rate low than those without disability and face wide unemployment gap than many of their international peer their poverty rate be high this be not compassion we owe it to these individual and to the welfare state found principle to fix this problem we can not avoid change or fall back on impractical slogan to do so would be to abandon those who most need help yet that be what these amendment and new clause do shall start with amendment and and new clause table by the opposition whose benches be empty these measure reveal lack of seriousness and of plan the tories preside over this crisis of opportunity and soar claimancy they fail to reform the system to address the disability employment gap or to tackle fraud which triple on their watch throughout this debate they have be unable to explain their alternative the shadow minister the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger whom it be good to see in his place recently admit as much say that he could not say exactly what he would do so they resort to gimmick amendment demand that all assessment be face to face forget that it be the conservatives who cut face to face assessment by if there be an olympic event for brass neck they would win the gold medal every time this proposal be unworkable deny frontline manager discretion fact the conservatives essentially admit in the small print it be also unnecessary unlike the conservatives in government this government be restore most assessment back to be face to face the same apply to amendment and new clause pip already have strict residency and qualification rule and be need base these proposal would not effect meaningful change but would slow down reform once again this be gesture politic the conservatives do not have plan while the opposition admit problem but offer no plan amendment to amendment seem fear to deny that there be problem at all propose simply to remove all change to the lcwra the change those behind the amendment want to scrap be vital to rebalance the system which will not just remove disincentive to work but enable the large above inflation increase in basic jobseeker benefit since the these benefit will rise year for million people by help people in my constituency remove these change risk lose measure that would lift child out of poverty none of this be easy we be talk about real life not abstract policy understand the anxiety this debate cause but freeze the system in aspic and ignore its failing would lock in current injustice and create future problem we should start reform by reaffirm the system basic purpose to protect and treat all with dignity but also to empower people and give they true agency that mean recognise that some can not work ensure protection for the vulnerable and listen to and co produce with disabled people however it also mean ensure that those who can work do so offer support and hold employer to account believe that the government proposal do so just as attlee government reimagine the role of the state after the war so we must reimagine it now after the upheaval of the pandemic economic change and rise ill health the world have change and our welfare system must do so too we must reform the system not in spite of labour value but because of they call the liberal democrat spokesperson colleague have describe the event surround this bill as chaotic and shambolic and they be right to do so sadly by fail to consult on key element the government be set up the bill to fail moreover the government impact assessment be fear somewhat misleading because it bake in cut that the previous government have plan but not actually implement as result be somewhat cautious of some of the government figure as the liberal democrat spokesman acknowledge that there need to be reform of the welfare system we need to chase down the cost but this be not the way to do so invest to save be the way to make serious change one investment that we need to undertake be in our nhs although we welcome the investment that be currently take place in the nhs we know and know this from my constituent in torbay that there be still people with long term illness who be stick on universal credit because the health intervention that desperately need to happen have not happen for they we also need to be alive to the challenge that we face in our employment market we should take not siloed approach to this matter but an holistic approach that look at how we can fix the whole system therefore as liberal democrats we truly welcome the charlie mayfield review look over the channel at our continental neighbour we see that they have significantly high productivity and high employment among people who be long term sick and have disability clearly there be lesson that can be learn chase this legislation through parliament in the way that have be do be set the situation up for failure it be bizarre be it not that there be an amendment that would take personal independence payment out of the title of the bill that be right and welcome the fact that number of labour members stand up and be count on this find it particularly abhorrent that number of ministers keep on suggest or hint that pip be an out of work benefit when the reality be that it often help people get in the right place to be able to work fear that one minister who be very well respected be effectively be use as human shield because he undertake the timms review we have significant question around that review although we have massive respect for he as minister we fear that the review be put the cart before the horse we need to ensure that there be true engagement with disability group and that we hear from carer as part of those group and that it be not just tick box exercise as have hear some member say universal credit still have two tier element again it be this orwellian approach where some people who be ill be more equal than other and that be perverse in the extreme as liberal democrats we have some real concern around this we be also alive to the fact that the new economics foundation highlight that this will still plunge people into poverty which be not what we should be do in this chamber to conclude the bill have be irresponsibly rush through if we be serious about help some of the most vulnerable people in our community the good way to do so be to engage with they take time and get the right result for they as the liberal democrat spokesperson wish to highlight amendment which would provide that engagement and most of all the due diligence that we deserve if the amendment fall would encourage colleague to vote against the bill tonight call the shadow minister so here we be labour have have year include year spend complain about welfare reform while the conservative government fix the catastrophic mess of unemployment benefit that we inherit the alphabetti spaghetti of welfare that we have in if any of their member can remember it we fix all those benefit trap introduce universal credit make work pay and support people off welfare and into job in the first decade of our time in government few people be economically inactive every single year of the in we have the low number of workless household since record begin then covid hit and labour be clamour for more welfare throughout that period after the covid incident as we leave office we be introduce reform to fix the health and disability benefit system all of that be oppose every step of the way by labour do the shadow minister really believe that anyone could truly think that the conservatives ensure that disabled people be well pay when year of their government lead to disability pay gap the fact be in our time in government we increase the number of disabled people in work significantly two million more disabled people be in work at the end of our time in government than before there be much to regret about the last year of our time in government and be critic of they myself but on welfare throughout our time in government we have proud record of improve the broken system that we inherit we be now year into labour time in government they have have all this time to come up with plan and we have absolutely nothing clause do have some change to the system but they be go to scrap that today want to pay tribute to the rebel on the labour benches for find their voice and show what parliament can do and particularly pay tribute to the hon member for york central rachael maskell the real prime minister sit there on the real front bench respect and honour they all as for the government front bench they be chop the bill title in half it be now nothing to do with pip so we have no reform to welfare and certainly no saving this be now spending bill not saving bill look at the impact assessment that have just be publish the third in the last three week think if we add up the saving from cut uc health for new claim which be little over billion and minus the cost of raise the standard allowance which be little over billion we get million of extra cost over the next four year plus the billion of extra employment support labour idea of save money on welfare be to spend more by the end of the bill passage the government have also spend the money that they think they be save from the pip change before they do the turn even now they be on wing and prayer financially the office for budget responsibility on which the tottering chancellor have rely to hold up her sum assume that the on flow to benefit will fall halfway back to their level over this parliament if they do not the chancellor will have to find another billion why should new claim reduce under this government when there be still an incentive of week to get on to uc health and there be no reform to pip for at least another year the minister have also say that his famous eponymous review be not aim at save money anyway the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman challenge he early to confirm that and think he have confirm from the dispatch box that there will be no saving from his review meanwhile the uk be haemorrhage job thank to the national insurance rise and we have the employment rights bill come down the track the obr do not even include in its forecast the likely impact of the unemployment bill that labour be introduce that be something we can look forward to in the autumn we be in deep fiscal hole and of course we need welfare reform in fact we need welfare cut that be why the opposition want to support the government when they set out their intention and we say that we would support the bill if they reduce spending get more people into work and pledge that there would be no new taxis but they do none of that so we do not support it we do however have further set of proposal my friend the hon member for hendon david pinto duschinsky challenge to come up with some alternative and we have some amendment to that very effect first amendment would improve the quality of assessment there be big piece of work to be do and welcome the government look closely at the assessment process but right now we could make one clear and simple improvement in of pip assessment be conduct face to face last year the figure be that be covid that be absolutely covid change that be not change back in time totally agree the fact be the work from home culture really take off at the dwp and with its subcontractor and that do need to change recognise that why be the government not do that as result in the system we have which be not be change by the bill people be at the mercy of some distant faceless assessor on the end of the phone of course there will be people who can not manage face to face assessment and we would authorise the secretary of state to specify circumstance for that it be also right not to call people back for repeat assessment that be change that the conservatives be introduce and be glad that the government be stick with it but for the great majority of case we have get to get back to face to face assessment for the sake of claimant as well as the taxpayer secondly turn to amendment we have new pip claim day that have double since covid and more than half the increase be in mental health case for uc health claim it be more like three quarter of course distress be real in our society and it be rise do not disparage the reality of many of these claim but as the minister have say the incidence of disability in our society be rise by while benefit claim be rise by for some of the less severe mental health claim it be far bad in january there be claim for people with anxiety disorder this year there be in january there be claim for anxiety and depressive disorder mix now there be autism be and have go up to the hon member for sheffield hallam olivia blake mention adhd which have go up from to over the last five year wonder whether the shadow minister realise that accord to the dwp own statistic the pip fraud rate be do not want he to feel like mug be not talk about explicit fraud these award be be give and no doubt the assessment be judge they to be eligible there be not necessarily deliberate attempt to defraud the system what we have do be create system whereby one be incentivise to seek high and more expensive claim rise be happy to give way order before the hon member make her intervention will colleague make sure that their language be parliamentary and respectful want to pull up the shadow minister on the adhd statistic will he recognise that woman be not recognise as have adhd for many year and thus there be backlog of woman now access their right to benefit relate to adhd many woman like be misdiagnose with depression and anxiety disorder instead of adhd be sure that the hon lady be right those disorder have also increase extraordinarily in recent year take her point and be strike by the point she make in her speech about how many people with adhd would benefit from be in the workplace they could be in work and they need to be support for that it be not right that we be consign so many people to life on the sofa with the curtain draw be tell that they have no value and no contribution to make and will receive no help last year more people get pip because of dyslexia which be twice the number before covid it be for ocd again that number have double want to acknowledge that the charity mind of course it want to increase benefit so do not cite it in support of our amendment have say that what people with mental health condition need be decent mental health support proper employment programme and flexible workplace that be what be need let finish with new clause the other place where we can look for real saving be with foreign national claim health and disability benefit be aware that many visa have no recourse to public fund but people with indefinite leave to remain do some people be likely to claim indefinite leave to remain in the course of this parliament we do not have enough datum from the dwp so urge the government to have more transparency about the information that be receive however on the basis of the information we have we believe that some hundred of thousand of people in this country who be claim pip and uc health be foreign national that do not include eu citizen who have right under the withdrawal agreement welfare be simply not part of the contract that we make with people who come to this country they be give visa on the basis that they will support themselves and our amendment would make that principle real every pound spend on benefit for someone who could be support into work be pound less for someone else who can not or can never work and who deserve all our sympathy and support we can not wait another year for this dithering hamstrung government to come forward with the change we need our amendment offer path to well system that be fair for claimant and fair for taxpayer and commend they to the committee thank everybody who have speak in this debate if someone can work they should my hon friend the member for hendon david pinto duschinsky be absolutely right to remind the house that that principle underpin the creation of the welfare state by the post war labour government if someone need help into work the government should provide it and those who can not work must be able to live with dignity those be the principle underpin what we be do the uk uniquely in the have low rate of employment today than we have before the pandemic my hon friend the members for ealing southall deirdre costigan and for hendon be right to point out that that be uniquely uk problem in large measure it be because of the trap in the universal credit system that this bill address the system need to be fix and it be urgent to get on and do that my hon friend the member for bermondsey and old southwark neil coyle be right to point out to the house that delay be not the answer the delay be call for by the conservatives be not the right way forward abandon people in the way the system have for year have be catastrophic there be million people out of work on health and disability benefit and hundred of thousand want to be back in work and say they could be if only they have the support to get back into job we be determined to provide they with that support when the bill start its life the government be advocate for cut for pip and uc health claimant now and in future they concede that now be not right and that it be only for future claimant then they concede that it should not be pip claimant in future leave only uc health claimant do my right hon friend understand the anxiety and confusion that this have cause people in the disabled community would it not be well to pause wait for the review and do it properly no because reform be urgently need we be elect to deliver change and that be what we must do it be particularly scandalous that the system give up on young people in such enormous number with nearly million not in employment education or training my hon friend the member for peterborough andrew pakes be absolutely right to highlight that point we need to get on and tackle the disability employment gap the bill address the severe work disincentive in universal credit it protect those we do not ever expect to work from universal credit reassessment and the poverty impact assessment which have now be publish make it clear that child will be lift out of poverty we be rebalancing support here be grateful for the minister generosity which he always show in this chamber base on the poverty assessment he now say that child will be uplifted and take out of poverty give that the decision be take because of the fiscal impact of the chancellor budget ask he last week about the billion of saving that then become billion he then say that he have not cost his decision which would have put an extra child into poverty will he tell the house how much extra the measure on which he have capitulate will cost the taxpayer be happy to give the hon gentleman the same answer that give he last week which be that the figure will be publish by the obr in the usual way number of amendment that have be discuss relate to clause which as the house know we be remove through government amendment so the bill will make no change to pip parallel amendment to schedule cover northern ireland and as have be point out government amendment change the bill name once enact to the universal credit act we will now make pip fit and fair for the future with the wide review to conclude by autumn next year the opposition amendment on face to face assessment therefore no long fit in the bill but would say to the shadow minister the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger that we be indeed go to get ahead with increase the number of face to face assessment and the point that he need to recognise be that that should have be do after the pandemic and it be not do we be get on and fix the problem be grateful to my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball for give the house in her new clause helpful checklist of the desirable feature of our co produce review have commit to disability rights uk and to other that will shortly discuss these matter with they but let set out my thinking now in response to my hon friend new clause accept subsection of her new clause the un convention on the right of person with disability have feature bit in this debate my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy refer to it as do other to quote article of the convention we should closely consult with and actively involve person with disability in carry out the review accept the point make by my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge that that be what co production entail rise rise let make just little more headway will give away little bit later as my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge and have discuss do not agree that the review must be finish within month we want to complete the review by autumn of next year and with no four point threshold do not think it be in anybody interest to rush it accept her proposal in subsection of her new clause for group to co produce the review not so much to provide independent oversight as to lead and deliver it will chair the group and we will work with she and other to include disabled people with live and professional experience in its leadership and in shape its meeting with around dozen member and with capacity to engage other as need on specific topic my hon friend have make helpful suggestion for who some member of the group might be we will want disabled parliamentary representation to be involve in the process as well and arrangement to involve disabled people more broadly agree with she that the majority of the group member need to be disabled people or representative of disabled people organisation and that they need to be provide with adequate support include towards their cost of travel and take part be grateful to the minister for accept so many aspect of new clause and for his assurance from the dispatch box will not be press the new clause to vote if he can offer further assurance that there will be sufficient link between the timms review recommendation and subsequent legislation on pip to ensure accountability and that the voice of disabled people be hear can give my hon friend that assurance yes the outcome of the review will be central to the legislation that follow really welcome the fact that disabled group be go to be meaningfully engage accord to the minister proposal and look forward to see the full detail of that but how will carer group be engage as well would welcome some assurance on that the hon gentleman raise that point very reasonably in the debate and it be certainly something we need to consider as well welcome the commitment to work with disabled people the minister will know that the difference between consultation and co production be that every participant have to have veto of the outcome in order to co produce otherwise with the great will in the world it be just another form of consultation can he give we an assurance that disabled group will have veto over the proposal to engage the consultation process we will aim for consensus among all those take part and that be what hope we will achieve rise rise will not give way for moment or two on parliament handling of the review outcome which be also raise in new clause would envisage ministerial oral statement can commit on behalf of the government that there will then be general debate on it in government time and that the legislation to implement the review outcome will not be bring forward until that have happen will the minister give way not just at the moment clause introduce the first ever sustain above inflation rise to the universal credit standard allowance the previous government run universal credit down they do not uprate it they freeze it force mass dependence on food bank the increase be accompany by reduction as we debate in the health top up for most new claimant as set out in clause clause set out that the health top up would be freeze until for exist claimant and for those with the most severe lifelong condition or those near the end of life the government amendment mean that for exist claimant the standard allowance plus the health top up will rise at least in line with inflation up to that also apply to people with severe lifelong condition who we do not ever expect to work and those near the end of life clause and the amendment to it mirror the universal credit change in employment and support allowance the bill will protect exist claimant in powerful way include those with fluctuate health condition but it will move decisively to more proactive pro work system that be what we need and the protection for those who be on universal credit at the moment rise rise let make just little more headway the protection for those who be on universal credit at the moment and who be on the lcwra rate be that if they go into work they be likely depend of course on their income to stay on universal credit so that protection will continue while they be in work if their income rise to the level where they be lift off universal credit for six month they will retain that protection and if they go back they will return to their original rate so there be very strong protection there rise no will not give way some amendment seek to change the new universal credit arrangement the increase to the standard allowance the first permanent real term increase in the headline rate of out of work benefit for decade be an important step forward as my hon friend the member for morecambe and lunesdale lizzi collinge highlight balance that with low health top up for most new claim be key to tackle on point of order madam chair we be tell that the bill be go to bring billion saving to the exchequer then it be billion be it in order not to have any idea what this will cost the taxpayer that be point of debate not point of order continue minister thank you madam chair will the minister ensure that the universal credit health element form part of the co produce timms review when review the assessment process as the uc health element will be assess under the new pip assessment furthermore can we ensure that all disability benefit and support be in scope so that we can truly get an assessment process fit for the future my hon friend be right that the green paper set out our proposal that the pip assessment will in future also be the gateway to the universal credit health top up give it indeed broad role our aim be specifically co produce benefit assessment if that work well there may well be strong case to apply the same approach maybe even use the same or similar group to other challenge and perhaps include other aspect of the health and disability benefit system but that would need to follow successful completion of the task immediately in hand let finally make an important point which be make by my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie and other the severe condition criterion in the bill exactly reflect how the functional test be apply at present that be in guidance it be be move in this bill into legislation it do take account of parkinson and ms because people need to meet these descriptor reliably safely repeatedly and in reasonable timeframe so can give firm assurance to those concerned about how the severe condition criterion will work for those with fluctuate condition the word constantly here refer as say in my early intervention to the functional criterion need to apply at all time not to somebody symptom this bill begin to repair broken system that hold people back by remove work disincentive from universal credit we will provide record employment support

nash stephen whalley eugene reilly desmond reilly maureen roberts pamela palmer anne hayes maxine hambleton lynn bennett jane davis paul anthony davies and neil tommy marsh all lose their life they be son daughter parent brother sister innocent people murder in cold blood in britain deadly act of terrorism before today it be still the large bad unsolved mass murder in our nation history to this day not one person not one have be bring to justice for this atrocity that be why rise today to call for statutory judge lead public inquiry into the birmingham pub bombing under section of the inquiries act we all know what happen that night we know that the bomb be plant by member of the provisional ira we know that warning be phone in and we know that it come too late that it be chaotic inadequate and fatal we know that the birmingham six member of the irish community in birmingham be arrest torture and convict of crime they do not commit they spend year in prison before the court of appeal quash their conviction in the relative of the victim be leave to grieve in silence and be lie to by the police and by politician alike for decade they be shut out of justice ignore patronise and disbelieve in jury at the resume inquest conclude that the victim be unlawfully murder and that the ira be responsible yet the jury be not allow to consider who precisely carry out the bombing the question of who bomb birmingham who murder the and who commit the large unresolved murder on these island be rule out of scope so today the truth remain bury this be wound that have never really heal since the family of those who die have fight with extraordinary courage and dignity in the search for truth and in the quest for justice they have knock on every door they have sit with ministers they have win legal battle they have crowdfunde representation and they have take their case to westminster brussels dublin and belfast they have form the group justice for the lead by julie and brian hambleton whose sister be kill that night together they have do what so many other have fail to do they have have the courage and the will to keep the flame of truth alive commend the right hon member for bring this important matter to the house he mention julie hambleton have meet julie many time over the year salute her courage and tenacity and that of her fellow campaigner hope we can reach the point that they want to reach the secretary of state for northern ireland be in the house he make an exception for the finucane family and create hierarchy of victim surely the large most devastating terrorist act in our nation history be deserve of equal treatment and public inquiry should be give of course there be one organisation that know who carry out the bombing the ira but though it demand transparency of other it hold to itself its wicked secret be grateful to the hon and learn member for that intervention and for his support for my call he know as well as do that time after time at every turn the family be meet with barrier bureaucracy and broken promise they be tell that they could not get legal aid they be tell that their case be not part of the reconciliation or the legacy of the trouble they be tell to wait until west midlands police pursue lead that lead precisely nowhere they be tell again and again to be quiet but they would not be quiet and will not be quiet this house should not sit quiet while their search for justice be unfinished commend the right hon gentleman for bring forward this debate he be absolutely right to do so have meet julie hambleton and support her campaign have speak to she number of time both in belfast and over here justice be need for the innocent who be murder would like to see that as northern ireland mp the trouble be never too far from my mind the legacy act the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act never sit well with because of the like of the kingsmill atrocity and the need for the inquiry that the right hon gentleman be ask for and which have to say fully support do he not agree that these people have have no closure or justice whatever and that they deserve justice the very same justice as the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister say give to the finucane family be grateful to the hon member for bring that point to the floor of the house and for back my call this campaign be not about vengeance it be about truth and justice it be about the right to truth and accountability our system of law and order and our democracy should work for all not just the powerful we have to ask in this house why after all this time after year there have not be public inquiry let we be clear this can not be desktop review this can not merely be look into by an independent panel it must be judge lead statutory public inquiry with the full power to summon evidence compel witness and hold institution to account why because these grieve family have be fail time and again and after year it be enough thank my right hon friend for bring this debate to the house and for the powerful and creditable case he be make do he share the concern that after year memory be fade documentary evidence some of which may not be secure in the department or the national archives be at risk of destruction and the chance of bring those still live who bear responsibility for this atrocity to some measure of accountability be fade we may not be out of time but time be run out do he agree that action be need now yes and that be why be grateful to have be give time to make this call on the floor of the house tonight thank my right hon friend for secure this really important debate do he agree that for my constituent julie and paul the relative of two victim who have wait for over year to get justice enough be enough the family be still grieve we must secure an independent public inquiry that include the effective participation of the relative as matter of urgency so that the family can get closure my hon friend be exactly right she speak with such passion and eloquence about this issue she know as well as do how deeply the family feel their pain since the exoneration of the birmingham six the man who be torture frame and imprison no one have be hold to account for that failure since no new suspect have be bring to trial since even though witness have admit that they know who be responsible no one have be compel to testify despite the fact that man like michael christopher hayes former member of the provisional ira confess in bbc interview that he accept collective responsibility for what he call terrible tragedy and despite witness and chris mullin indicate in their evidence to the inquest that they have knowledge of those responsible for the murder while the coroner accept assurance from the government legal department that relevant document have be disclose widespread doubt remain about whether information hold in the home office foreign office or ministry of defence be in fact make available commend the right hon gentleman on secure this important adjournment debate more than half century have pass and it seem that consecutive government have not provide closure not just for the victim and their family but for those who be falsely convict and their family do the right hon gentleman believe that it be lack of political will as oppose to anything else that be prevent we from have public inquiry the thrust of what the hon gentleman say be right will come on to some reflection on that in just moment we know that there be document that be not provide to the inquest key individual involve have die but there be allegation that at least two of those responsible be still alive and live free and that their name can be find in book in the house of commons library as my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield laurence turner say as the year pass memory fade and witness die and the trail of truth grow cold that be why it be time to act now let we look at the fact this be the large unsolved mass murder in british history no statutory inquiry have ever be launch into what happen no one from the state have ever be hold accountable for the failing of the investigation the imprisonment of the innocent or the denial of justice to the family by contrast at the urging of this house we have rightly ensure for victim of hillsborough the infected blood scandal grenfell windrush and the post office scandal that we get to the bottom of what happen and what cause the pain for so many victim why not birmingham why be the people of birmingham not give the justice that they deserve it be time we send the message from this house that there can be no more excuse public inquiry be not just legal tool but national act of conscience it be how democracy apologise with honesty it be how we tell the victim and their family that they matter that their loss matter and that their love one will not be forget crucially it be how we learn if we can not learn the lesson of the past the risk be that we repeat they we say often in this house that justice delay be justice deny it have be year since that terrible night year of injustice year of door close and back turn say that be long enough want to be very clear with the house tonight about what we be seek we be seek statutory public inquiry under section of the inquiries act we be seek judge lead process with full legal power to compel witness and evidence we be seek an independent inquiry that be resource to ensure the effective participation of the family and that ask openly without constraint fear or favour who bomb birmingham we be seek an inquiry that examine the role of the police the criminal justice system and the state both then and since we have to be clear madam deputy speaker that this crime be not cover by the legislation and the agreement that secure peace in northern ireland and that mean something important it mean that the home secretary have the power right now to order this inquiry there be no legal obstacle the only question be whether there be the political will in april eight birmingham mp write to the home secretary to demand this inquiry in november on the anniversary justice for the renew its call and that call be back by cross party group of mps mayor lawyer and campaigner write again to the home secretary in spring this year have not yet have an answer about decision on whether an inquiry will be launch which be why have ask for this debate tonight be ask not for special treatment but for equal treatment for birmingham to be give the justice that have be offer to the victim of so many scandal where we have set up inquiry to get to the bottom of the truth thank my right hon friend for secure such an important debate as other have say an inquiry be absolutely crucial last november add my name to the call for an inquiry for the family for the victim and also for the city this have be cloud that have cover birmingham for year wonder whether my right hon friend have reflect on what signal what message it send that we be still wait and on what it be that those family can believe in if they can not get the truth for which they have wait for so long my hon friend be absolutely right this be about the past this be about truth and this be about justice but she be right to say that this be also about the future this be about whether we in this house believe in justice without exception justice without delay and justice that do not stop at the door of power it be about whether the government of this country will look the people of birmingham in the eye and say we hear you we see you we believe you and we will not rest until you get the answer that you deserve let we honour the memory of those soul who never come home that night let we stand with their family and speak for city that be still scar by the silence let we at long last do what we should have do decade ago let we hold public inquiry into the birmingham pub bombing may start by commend my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne for secure this debate he be very long stand member of this house and know that this be an issue of huge importance to he and his constituency and to other member from across the house who represent birmingham he have make his case passionately and powerfully and the home secretary and have hear what he have have to say as well as the contribution of other member for which we be grateful will respond to the point that have be make but first want to say something about the bombing themselves we must never lose sight of the fact that the bomb plant in the mulberry bush and the tavern in the town public house in birmingham on november claim life injure more than other and cause untold devastation and pain the harm cause by these brutal attack go far beyond those kill and injure it continue to affect parent child sibling and friend to this day more than half century have pass since the bombing but the impact of these atrocity remain vivid and raw not just in birmingham but in our national psyche above all we think of the victim and their family want to recognise the work of the justice for the campaign which have continue to powerfully advocate for all those affected and to seek justice for their love one acknowledge their long stand request for the establishment of public inquiry into the bombing the home secretary be consider advice and be determined to provide an answer to the family and victim as soon as possible be sure that member will understand that we will ensure that the family be the first to hear the outcome my right hon friend mention in his speech that the birmingham pub bombing be not cover by the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act he be right that public inquiry into the birmingham pub bombing be not prevent by the act the act do not prevent any public inquiry from take place however want to emphasise that the birmingham pub bombing be absolutely in scope of the legacy act and would be eligible for an investigation lead by the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery which the act create have full confidence that the commission and its team of dedicated staff hold sufficient power resource and expertise to support the family in the process of seek answer to their question indeed the commission be already investigate the guildford pub bombing be very glad that the minister have concentrate on the truth and justice aspect of the legacy act can he reassure the house that in their proposal to repeal the legacy act the government be not go to lose the opportunity of have the trade off as it be between immunity from prosecution and truth recovery which be always the basis of the legacy act the right hon gentleman who be very experienced member of this house will know that be stand next to the secretary of state for northern ireland and hope that he will understand that the work of the previous government while no doubt well intentione do not provide solution that have the support of political party in northern ireland nor do it have the support of veteran and those who suffer the impact of terrorism can give he an absolute assurance that the secretary of state for northern ireland work with colleague right across government will do everything possible to ensure that we put in place solution and settlement that be able to attract wide support it be kind of the minister to give way one more time urge ministers not to be blind by what political party in northern ireland say because the truth of the matter be that they have to take certain position usually one that favour their side and disfavour the other side and the prospect of get all those party to agree on something like this be minute that be why the legacy act cut through all that in the same way that nelson mandela come up with similar solution that work in south africa hope that the right hon gentleman would accept that none of the political party in northern ireland be able to support the previous arrangement know that he understand the complexity of these matter and hope that he will see that this government be act in good faith and attempt to put in place an arrangement that can attract the widespread support that be require as be say the option for family to refer their case to the commission be available now encourage any victim survivor or family member affect by the trouble to give consideration to the commission in their search for answer number of investigation have be conduct over the year since the bombing include west midlands police investigation between and and between and as well as coronial inquest that conclude in as be the case with so many incident that occur during the trouble the prospect of criminal justice outcome be increasingly unlikely the family of the bereaved in birmingham like so many other completely understandably continue to seek the information and accountability that they deserve my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north raise the desire of the family for the role of the police and the criminal justice system to be investigate as part of any public inquiry as member will be aware the independent office for police conduct be respected and well test forum for such matter as northern ireland veteran myself know that the trouble be devastating time for the whole nation such that year on from the passing of the belfast good friday agreement the impact live on each tragedy have far reach and long stand effect on victim survivor and the community around they the work undertake by all those who seek to end the trouble have help prevent further such tragedy it be important that we seek to remain united across the house in our condemnation of anyone who seek to take we back to those time the pub bombing in birmingham kill or injure innocent people who happen to be in particular place when heinous act be perpetrate today and always we mourn the dead and hold their love one in our thought we think too of the survivor and all those who be affect want to finish by thank my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north for secure the debate and all the right hon and hon member who have contribute to it terrorist attack have terrible and far reach consequence on individual community and our society as whole we must stand unite to combat terrorism whether it be drive by political religious or ideological cause the government and the people of this country be unite in our condemnation of those who inflict violence on our street the birmingham pub bombing be brutal moment in the history of that great city and of our country day when life be cruelly snatch away and hundred more change forever we understand that the devastation cause by those horrific attack continue for people to this day and more than year later the fact that their quest for answer and justice go on must be unbelievably distressing as have say we recognise the frustration that cause yet these be decision that need to be take incredibly carefully the government will respond to the request for public inquiry as soon as possible have the utmost sympathy for the bereaved family and for the survivor their experience for over year have be deeply painful and be sure that right hon and hon member across the house continue to hold they in their thought and prayer question put and agree to house adjourn
