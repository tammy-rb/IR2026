incompetence take this down to the wire magistrate and judge be update by the press office of the sentencing council only at midday that the guideline due to come into force have in effect be suspend that raise the very real prospect that magistrate and judge sit from am this morning be unaware of this chaotic last minute change and sentence people under guideline that the justice secretary herself have concede be two tier but it get bad in that very email to thousand of judge and magistrate send just minute ago the sentencing council state we remain of the view that the guideline be necessary and appropriate confusion reign they be be tell one thing by the lord chancellor and another by the sentencing council who really be in charge here yet again the justice secretary have be humiliate and undermine by activist judge seek to undermine the will of this place our parliament her authority have be shred she be be treat as two tier second tier justice secretary this situation be entirely preventable if the justice secretary have simply put party politic to one side and back our bill week ago to restore accountability and empower she to actually control justice policy but the labour party block it if the prime minister have be trick into sit at the front of the dockland light railway think that he be in charge as his chief of staff mock he for the other day the lord

shamble the lord chancellor will not even re establish ministerial oversight we be tell via frantic press briefing that her bill which we have not even see yet will surgically remove these two tier sentencing guideline that do not tackle the root cause of the problem at all which be an activist legal quango that hold view completely divergent to the public to parliament and now we be tell to the government unless she follow the formula of the bill produce by conservative mp we will be back here time and again to unwind the next piece of madness come out of the council take the sentencing council immigration guideline that water down sentence for immigration offence below the month threshold for automatic deportation if publish it will mean hundred of illegal migrant and foreign national offender will avoid deportation every single year it will blow hole in border security it even water down the maximum life sentence for people smuggler that be legislate for just under year ago it completely disregard parliamentary sovereignty at our last exchange the justice secretary say there would be no two tier justice on her watch well there it be and it be bad than that on january her own department not the sentencing council publish guidance order the prioritisation of bail for ethnic minority and transgender people continue practice introduce under gordon brown contrary to the misinformation peddle by her press office the department produce new guidance on pre sentencing report that have be in force for month which state that probation officer should consider the culture of an offender and whether they have suffer intergenerational trauma from historical event well that be cultural relativism which violate the rule of law and put the british public at risk this time nobody be to blame other than she it be her department it be black and white it be two tier justice have some question will the justice secretary reassure the house that nobody be sentence this morning under guideline that she concede be two tier can she honestly say at the dispatch box that she have confidence in the head of the sentencing council lord justice davies give that he have bring it into total disrepute yes or no if she can be she aware that he take to the airwave yesterday in an astonishing departure from the expect standard of judicial conduct to advocate for abolish short sentence especially for hyper prolific offender effectively instruct low court to follow suit it be time for he to go and if she will not sack he for that what will it take do the justice secretary have confidence in johanna robinson another member of the sentencing council who take moral objection to border control and describe the illegal migration act as appal lastly will the justice secretary change the guidance that her own department be produce and which have create two tier probation service or be it once again on her watch two tier justice under two tier keir
