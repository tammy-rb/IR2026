shadow chief secretary to the treasury and he be always courteous and pleasant as my opposite number as he outline he come from family commit to public service both his great uncle be member of this house and although he be very modest about it he have be in public service for more than year the new member of the house have much to learn from he know that speak for the whole house in say how much we all admire his personal bravery in campaign for more victim support follow the tragic death of his daughter in hit and run accident not only be the hon gentleman one of the more popular member of the house as we hear but he be also the most popular constituency mp enjoy the big majority of any member of this place in recent election he even win an astonishing of the vote he might be the only person who can persuade kim jong un of the benefit of democracy although the people republic of bootle do quite have the same ring to it wonder whether the hon gentleman be choose to speak today to head off the reintroduction of his ten minute rule bill speak of course of his bill for four day week be not sure whether he have consult his whip on how compatible that would be with their desire to make fridays new norm sit day will say this to he if they will not let he have his ten minute rule bill he should work to rule although suspect that as labour member for merseyside he need no tip on trade union organise from former banker the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi speak with typical verve she be inspire by desire to serve and her strong faith but she never let any of this go to her head today she be choose because of the high regard that she be hold in but she be also one of the kind members of this house regularly bake victoria sponge for her staff and other although post the election result perhaps red velvet might now be on the menu she have campaign bravely against gang violence in both the london assembly and this house and she be so right that we must not become desensitise to knife crime she represent the place where she grow up and do so with passion and determination now that have lot more time on my hand intend to be regular visitor to the hon lady constituency especially in the summer month one of my favourite place to watch cricket be of course the oval as prime minister have the privilege of play there with the wonderful ebony rainford brent and the young black cricketer of the african caribbean engagement programme applaud the hon lady for her work with that scheme can reassure she that will not go as far as the last conservative prime minister to speak from this dispatch box who propose remove that part of her constituency to desert island along with his eight favourite record the hon lady story be truly an inspirational one to go from care for her mother as teenager to be member of this house show what be possible in our country but the online abuse that she have receive an experience that be far too common in this house show one of the challenge face our democracy the intimidation that some candidate receive in this election both physical and digital be completely unacceptable and be threat to our electoral process there can be no excuse for threat of physical violence or intimidatory protest outside politician home the hon lady will have be pick to second the loyal address because the whips office have she down as one who will go far may offer some word of advice to labour member on the government benches life come at you fast soon you might be fortunate enough to be tap on the shoulder and offer junior ministerial role then you will find yourself attend cabinet and then in the cabinet then when the prime minister position become untenable you might end up be call to the high office and before you know it you have bright future behind you and be leave wonder whether you can credibly be an eld statesman at the age of laughter it be right to begin by congratulate the prime minister on his decisive victory in the election he deserve the good will of we all in this house as he take on the most demanding of job in the increasingly uncertain world in which we now live the labour party have successfully tap into the public desire for change but it must now deliver change and we in the opposition will hold it accountable for deliver on the commitment that it make to the british people in the national interest we will not oppose for the sake of it but when we disagree with the government it be our responsibility as the opposition to say so what will guide we will be our principle sound public finance belief that people know how to spend their own money well than government do and that private enterprise not state intervention be the key to deliver growth and prosperity public service that work for those who need they an education system that give everyone the good start in life secure border and strong national defence welcome the government decision to bring forward martyn law be sure that the prime minister will find as do that one of the most humbling part of the job be see people whose life have be touch by tragedy not turn to anger or bitterness but campaign to ensure that other family do not have to endure the same pain particularly commend figen murray for her work to get this law on to the statute book can assure she that this measure will command consensus in this house and we will work with the government to make sure that it become law as soon as possible be also glad that the government will continue with plan for smokefree generation know there be deeply hold view on both side of this issue and have deep respect for those especially on my own benches who disagree with on this question measure that end access to product be never easy but believe that ensure that our child can be the first generation that do not have to suffer the false choice between quit smoking and not because they will have never start be truly worthy aim it will make we healthy fair country where people live long and well life the first duty of government be the defence of the realm and we be fortunate in our country to be protect by armed force who be unrivalle in the world for their professionalism bravery and skill know the whole house will agree that they be truly the good of we every month in my previous job become more concerned about the threat to our country security we live in an increasingly uncertain world we need great investment in our military if we be to deter our enemy and defend our interest as warn early this year there be an axis of authoritarian state that be threat to our value freedom democracy and the rule of law and we must collectively stand up to they the world be more dangerous now than it have be at any time since the end of the cold war so urge the prime minister to commit to boost defence spending to of gdp by if we lead the way on this issue we can make the new nato benchmark for defence investment that be the single good way to strengthen the alliance it would show the americans that we do not expect they to bear every burden and would show president putin that nato be serious about bolster its defence and be the most effective way to deter further act of russian aggression in the past few year there have be an impressive amount of consensus across the house on foreign policy on the importance of support ukraine and on the centrality of nato to our national defence in that spirit commend the prime minister for his work at the nato summit and be glad that he and the secretary of state for defence have take such rapid step to demonstrate that although the government have change this country commitment to ukraine security remain constant also welcome the visit of the right hon member for tottenham mr lammy to the middle east it be of fundamental importance to this country that as we make real progress towards two state solution our friend and ally israel have right to defend itself and to live in peace let turn next to another crucial issue face not just our country but the broad western world illegal migration the fundamental question be what to do with people who arrive here illegally but can not be return to their home country our approach be to send they to safe third country the prime minister be clear that he would scrap those plan and acknowledge that our fear remain that without such deterrent the country will end up have to accept that large number of those who cross the channel illegally will end up remain here how to prevent that be something that the government know will soon look to address when it come to legal migration urge the home secretary to retain the measure that we implement which be forecast to halve net migration in the next month if may turn next to the economy understand well that the chancellor be keen to paint as bleak picture as possible but would gently point out that that be not exactly what the fact say with inflation at unemployment at and the fast grow economy in the so far this year the labour party have inherit an economy that be already on an upward trajectory the government have set out plan to strengthen the role of the office for budget responsibility and we will examine those proposal carefully but the work of the obr already mean that labour members have the full detail of the public finance when they set out their manifesto the obr have rightly take away from government the ability to make forecast say what they want they to say but that have also take away from oppositions come into government the ability to say that they do not know the true state of the public finance as paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies have say the book be wide open fully transparent in his word try to pretend that thing be bad than expect really will wash labour members promise no tax rise on work people and no plan for tax rise beyond what be in their manifesto in full knowledge of the public finance it would be difficult for they to claim that thing be bad than they think and then renege on those pledge and we will hold the government to their promise come the budget note the plan for new employment legislation in this country our unemployment rate be far low than the european average and that be thank in part to our flexible labour market urge labour not to impose new burden on business business leader themselves have warn of the unintended consequence of those plan that they could lead to firm be less likely to invest and less likely to hire so increase unemployment in the long term far note the government desire to impose new potentially rigid legislation on technology such as artificial intelligence we be third only to the us and china in the size of our fast grow technology sector and we lead the world when it come to ai safety we should all in this house be careful not to endanger this country lead position in this field which will drive growth and prosperity for decade to come although today king speech contain slew of bills what be miss be concrete plan to tackle the unsustainable post covid rise in the welfare bill without action the cost of provide benefit to the working age population with disability or health condition will rise to billion more than we spend on our national defence school or policing that be not only unsustainable but unfair to taxpayer that be why in government we have lay out plan to reduce the welfare bill significantly but crucially to support all those who could do so to go back into work hope the government look at those proposal when they have the time to study they in detail on the conservative benches we will continue to advocate for welfare system that be compassionate and fair to those who need it but fair too to those who pay for it the government have set out plan to change the planning system we will of course study those thoroughly as well as we all wish to see more home build and the planning process speed up however would say that system that do not allow local people to have say will damage public consent for more housing in the long term regret that there be no mention in the king speech of farming and rural community much like my own but hope in time that the government will bring forward proposal turn to net zero this country have decarbonise quick than any other major country and we have manage to do that while grow the economy as country and across this whole house know we will all be proud of that achievement the government plan to decarbonise the grid by but there be real danger that if the government put the speed of do that ahead of family finance and our energy security we will again lose public consent for the measure necessary to ensure that we actually reach our net zero target target on which there be genuine consensus between our two party as even one of the prime minister own supporter have warn this plan just mean we have to import our energy strategically we become more vulnerable we pay more money for our energy hope that the energy secretary reflect on those thought lastly the government have set out plan for reform to the other place look at the government benches there can be no doubt about their ability to get they through this house but the effect of the change will last long beyond this parliament and long beyond our tenure in these job would suggest that when it come to constitutional reform it would be good to proceed on cross party basis rather than to use simple majority in this house to push thing through that consensus should include the cross benchers whose convenor would be remove by the government proposal also suspect that the public would prefer the government to prioritise practical real world issue over constitutional wrangling however welcome the news that the government have pause their plan to force member of the other place to retire at that proposal always feel like it would be blunt instrument indeed in the dissolution honour the prime minister nominate rightly the former right hon member for derby south who will be strong addition to the other place despite the right hon lady be already over the retirement age that the labour manifesto propose let close by say that we of course recognise that the british people have entrust the labour party with the task of govern our country on our side of the house we will fulfil our duty as the loyal opposition professionally and effectively across this house we be all first and foremost patriot we all wish to see our country and our people flourish and succeed in that spirit wish the new prime minister and the new government well now call the prime minister thank you mr speaker join the leader of the opposition in his tribute to his majesty the king it be so heartening to see he in his rightful place deliver the gracious speech be sure that the whole house will not mind once again wish he speedy recovery also join the right hon gentleman in wish her majesty the queen happy birthday we also wish president trump speedy recovery from the appalling attempt on his life at the weekend speak with president trump on sunday night to pass on our good wish and also to share our revulsion at the senseless violence which have no place in democracy the last time that we debate the loyal address and stand at the opposition dispatch box could see for the first time the then new plaque now behind commemorate the memory of sir david amess know how hard that loss be for conservative members now stand on this side of the house can see for the first time in front of the plaque to our dear friend jo cox with her word that catch the air of this chamber even more at moment like this more in common while our thought at this time be of course with president trump and the american people we can not think that this be something that only happen elsewhere we must heed the word of president biden to lower the temperature of our democracy work across our disagreement and find each other common decency congratulate the england football team on their achievement in the euros which the leader of the opposition and be talk about this morning yes the trophy elude we again but the team can be proud of another exceptional performance something be sure the whole house would be only too pleased to recognise we pay tribute to gareth southgate who shoulder the burden of national leadership with such dignity this government have be elect to deliver nothing less than national renewal to stop the chaos of the past year turn the page on an era of politic as noisy performance and return it to public service and start the work of rebuild our country determined rebuilding patient rebuilding calm rebuilding it be rejection in this complicated and volatile world of those who can only offer the easy answer the snake oil charm of populism as the past year have show that road be dead end for this country it do nothing to fix our foundation and the british people have reject it as they have throughout our history what people really want be change and change be what this government of service will deliver king speech that take the brake off our economy and show to the british people that politic can be force for good the vehicle for improve the life of million no matter who they vote for this be day when we get on with the serious business of government yet house with no time for levity would go against the grain of our tradition so it be fantastic to hear my hon friend the member for bootle peter dowd in such fine fettle today when he propose the humble address he speak with great passion as he always do for his constituency which be famous as he mention for the antony gormley sculpture on crosby beach that work of art be entitle another place collection of gently rusting figure for whom the tide be perpetually come in solid grounding should my hon friend ever consider career in the other place be sure that the house will agree that my hon friend be also one of the warm and most generous member that generosity extend ahead of previous election to an offer to hand deliver conservative leaflet commitment to the democratic process that should be applaud not least because it result in stonke increase in his majority for labour as anyone who know my hon friend will confirm although he do like to relax with glass of wine and listen to engelbert humperdinck for he family always come first the leader of the opposition refer to my hon friend daughter and grow up he be care for by his four sister now he be never happy than when he be with his grandchild who be convinced that he know mary poppins personally belief that note he have never discourage he have be tremendous servant to our family the labour family and we thank he for his outstanding speech today the address be second by my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi it be fitting tribute for royal occasion as be tell that she be know as queen flo on instagram the house will know she as tireless champion for her community as well as found member of one of our most vital affiliate the labour friend of karaoke in fact be reliably tell that queen flo do mean queen bee which we look forward to hear at labour conference truly it be fantastic speech another demonstration that my hon friend be shin example of our movement she be young carer when grow up and be fighter for their cause on aids and hiv on the health inequality that still deliver poor outcome for black woman and on sickle cell which her late mum suffer from know what it be like to watch your mum move in and out of hospital as child so respect and admire the way my hon friend now champion young people from poor household and fight for the opportunity that they deserve perhaps most powerfully of all my hon friend have speak about her own experience of arrive at the scene of stabbing and have rightly demand that we never allow ourselves to become desensitise to the tragedy of knife crime as fellow inner london mp know how much this be hurt our city as it be hurt town and city across the country know how much potential be lose and how many family fear that their child could be next so be under no doubt turn the tide on this violence be absolutely central key mission that this government of service will take on both speech be in the fine tradition of this house let follow the leader of the opposition and mark the passing of our colleague in the traditional way since the last gracious speech the labour party have lose stalwart of our movement with the passing of tony lloyd who serve in year of distinction the community of rochdale manchester central and stretford have the chance to speak to tony just day before he leave we when he be leave hospital to go home he know that it be for the last time and that he would not see day like this without be partisan can tell you that he would have love to have see the house set up as it be today he would have tell we use his experience to use every precious moment that we have to serve those community that he hold so dear that be what he stand for the good of our movement he be champion of politic as force for good that be the great test of our time the fight for trust be the battle that define our political era it be task not just for the government but for the whole parliament we be all responsible for the tone and standard that we set want to thank the right hon gentleman the leader of the opposition because in every exchange that we have have since the election and in his word today he have go well beyond the usual standard of generosity thank he for that in that spirit this king speech pick up some of the important business not conclude in the last session on football governance and the reduction of smoking we hope to proceed in manner that recognise the previous consensus we will also carry forward the holocaust memorial bill so that we build that memorial next to this parliament and ensure that every generation reaffirm our commitment to never again we will also honour the promise that and the leader of the opposition make to the family of martyn hett and all the family affect by the horrific event in manchester that day figen murray martyn mum walk mile to tell we that britain need that law quickly tell she then that she would get that from labour government and we honour that promise today be grateful for the indication of the cross party support that we will have on that important provision because the security of the british people be the most fundamental priority of any government and whether our fight be against terrorist the vile criminal smuggling gang that weaken our border or foreign power that threaten the security of this nation we will leave no stone unturned when it come to keep the british people safe we will recognise the bravery of those on the frontline of keep we safe with new armed force commissioner that be not just name or role but strong and independent champion for those who have commit to the ultimate service as way in which we can show our respect we will also move quickly on the lesson from the infected blood scandal that the house debate in almost the final act of the last session day when we all of we undertake solemn responsibility not just to deliver justice to those people but to take on the work of prevention to ensure that those lesson shape the future of public service in our country because scandal like infected blood windrush horizon and hillsborough be unite not just by the scale of the injustice but by the indignity that the victim and their family have be put through merely for stand up for truth and justice so it be high time to bring in duty of candour the hillsborough law because government of service must also be government of accountability and justice that be what service mean thank the prime minister for give way during his excellent speech outline the hope and renewal within the king speech which be much need in constituency such as mine luton north where over of child be grow up in relative poverty what reassurance can he give and my constituent that he personally take this issue seriously and that his government will address it let reassure my hon friend and the whole house that take child poverty extremely seriously be proud of the last labour government record on reduce child poverty they clearly have strategy and we will have strategy be very pleased to have announce today the taskforce that will lead our strategy to reduce child poverty no child should grow up in poverty we will work across the house on that issue be grateful to the prime minister for give way on his newly announce taskforce which beth rigby announce on twitter as we be all in this chamber can the prime minister outline how many child will remain in poverty while that taskforce undertake its work which ultimately will lead to the same conclusion that we be propose to scrap the two child benefit cap do welcome this and know that it be an issue across the whole house do not think there be single member who do not care about child poverty the point of the taskforce be to devise strategy as we do when we be last in government to drive those number down it can not be single issue but one that cross number of strand and we will work with people across the house in order to tackle it what matter be the commitment to drive those number down that be what we do when last in government and we will do it again rise will make some progress and then give way respect the tone of the leader of the opposition contribution but can not stop my mind from wander back to nine month ago when he be at this dispatch box his great political hero nigel lawson once say to govern be to choose every day serve the people of this country be chance to make difference for they the last king speech be the day when the veil of his choice slip and we all see his party content to let our country problem fester and to push aside the national interest as they focus almost entirely on try to save their own skin we will have time over the week month and year ahead to debate the measure in this king speech and the choice of this government but defy anyone on the opposition benches or elsewhere to look at the ambition and purpose of our intent and not to see return to the serious business of government no more wedge issue no more gimmick no more party political strategy masquerade as policy this be an agenda focus entirely on deliver for the people of this country legislation for the national interest that seek only to fix our foundation and make people well off and to solve problem not exploit they rise will just make some progress with each day that pass my government be find new and unexpected mark of their chaos scar of the past year where politic be put above the national interest and decline deep in the marrow of our institution we have see that in our prison writ large we have see it in our river and sea even bad than we think we have see it in our council push to the brink by the previous government and now unable to deliver even basic service to child with special educational need we have already take the first step on so many of the priority we put before the british people the work of change have begin but we know as they do that national renewal be not quick fix the rot of year will take time to repair be grateful to the prime minister for give way he talk about priority of course people in rural community around the country see the vast majority that the right hon and learn gentleman have assemble and they be afraid they see manifesto in which just word be about farming they see king speech with no mention of rural community or priority will the prime minister please take this opportunity to reassure people in rural and farming community that his labour government will take notice of they order intervention be one thing but this be not the good time to actually make speech let take this opportunity to reassure those in rural community grow up in rural community myself if we look at the place now represent on the labour benches we can see the reassurance that have be give and will be give again the king speech that we have bring to the house today be marker of our intent not only certain destination for the future of this country but new way of governing government of service guide by clear mission with long term plan to fix the foundation plan that start as it must with our economy under the watch of the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak the last parliament be the first in modern history to leave living standard in bad place than it find they the consequence not just of tory irresponsibility but of more pervasive inability to face the future ducking of the hard choice eye fix always on the horse trading of westminster politic rather than the long term national interest will the prime minister give way will in moment we do not just turn the page on that today we close the door on it forever the budget responsibility bill will protect the living standard of work people from the chaos they endure under the last government commitment no matter how fierce the storm to economic stability as the foundation we build on that be change labour party at work and then on that foundation we take the brake off britain and go far and fast on measure to generate high economic growth worker and business unite in the cause of wealth creation we will reform the planning rule choice ignore for year to build the home and infrastructure that britain need we will level up right at work choice ignore for year to deliver security and dignity at work we will create new industrial strategy invest in clean cheap british energy harness the power of artificial intelligence improve our public transport confront our historic challenge on technical education transform our skill agenda in partnership with business and push forward devolution to the city region and council of england plan for wealth creation that will finally lead we out of the pay more get less doom loop that be the last government legacy let be clear we will work with anyone invest in the future of our country will the prime minister give way on that point will just complete this point say that we would serve everyone whether they vote for we or not and mean it let say directly to those on the opposition benches that if you be invest in the success of your community we will work with you this be new era we be turn the page return politic to service because that be what the people of this country want to see from their politician and service be strong bond than political self interest that be what country first mean the only way we can restore trust and the reason this government of service be elect we be also elect to repair our public service with investment and reform to make they once again beacon of justice for the community they serve signal to our country of the cause that fire national renewal my determination be for everyone in our country england scotland northern ireland wales no matter where they start in life to feel that success belong to they it be cause that believe unite this house and indeed the people of this great nation will the prime minister give way will hon member hooray may commend the prime minister there be many in this house on both side of the chamber not only in his party but on the opposition benches who welcome his election as prime minister and look forward to the delivery of some feel good factor for all of this great nation of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland well together be what always say perhaps even those in the chamber who have different idea think the same in my provincial paper two week ago it be recognise that northern ireland be very much part of the prime minister year plan will he outline exactly what that plan will be for northern ireland can he ensure we that our position will never weaken and always get strong jim you will definitely be at the bottom of the list now do not worry be grateful for that intervention it be very important to and to my government that within day of be elect go to scotland northern ireland and wales with that message about work together as the hon gentleman will know work in northern ireland for five year on reform to the police service in northern ireland it matter to that we make progress on all matter across all our nation and that be the way in which we will operate as government it be statement of intent that make in those early day and let say in direct answer to the hon gentleman question that will continue in that vein as well as maintain our plan to cut waiting time we will modernise the mental health act and finally drag it into the century we will raise standard in our school and improve the confidence the wellbeing and the happiness of our child because that be so often the barrier that hold they back we will also work on landmark legislation on race equality and tackle the structural injustice of unfair discriminatory pay britain have come long way on such matter one look at this parliament show that we be move forward and recognise the effort of so many in this house on all side to tackle this injustice but we can still do more and therefore we must and we will we will also begin work on ban conversion practice and will bring forward tough new protection for renter those be promise that have linger in the lobby of good intention for far too long we will signal our intent to transform society with measure on crime and justice that will not only rid our street of antisocial behaviour but launch new mission to reduce violence against woman and girl by in this we be inspire by the work of unbelievable campaigner mina smallman claire waxman melanie brown and my friend john and penny clough will never forget the day john and penny come to my office and tell what they have be through just to get justice for their daughter jane murder in the car park of the blackpool hospital where she work by the man await trial on multiple charge of rap she give they my word then that would do what could not just for john and penny and jane but for all the johns pennys and janes in our country but it be an enormous undertaking wish it be not but it be just listen to the contribution make every year in this house by my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips grim reminder of just how many woman be kill every year by domestic violence and yet as everybody who work in public service know government can make or break life have see it myself as public servant and also know from those campaigner what service can do when it listen and empower people far beyond the wall of the state so this be how we will go about our business mission drive focus on ambitious goal bring together the good of our country commit to the practical difference big and small that we can make together that be the reward and the hope of service the business of change and the work of this government of service that we will take on we will stop the chaos fix our foundation and take the brake off britain this be king speech that return politic to serious government that return government to public service and that return public service to the interest of work people that be the path of national renewal the rebuilding of our country and we take another step today order call the leader of order please let we show respect to each other let we not set off on the wrong foot we want to be on the right foot call the leader of the lib dems on behalf of the liberal democrats add our sincere thank to his majesty king charles for his gracious speech like other party leader wish he well as he continue his recovery and join they in send our happy return on the birthday of her majesty as we remember member who be kill in service and condemn the appalling assassination attempt on president trump we should all commit ourselves to new politic whereby we disagree with respect listen to each other and try to bring together the dialogue on politic in our country follow the division we have see may join other in pay tribute to the late tony lloyd who champion many campaign and issue in this house have the huge privilege of join he on an all party trip to israel and gaza and one of his commitment be to peace in the middle east he want justice for the palestinians and two state solution and let we all commit ourselves to that again also pay tribute to the hon member for bootle peter dowd and for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi for their accomplished speech in propose and second the loyal address know the hon member for bootle come from political family he explain that in some detail and believe that his great uncle peter who be once the labour mp for preston south later become liberal councillor in liverpool so may say to the hon gentleman that if he do follow in his great uncle footstep he will not be the first in his family to see the liberal light our door be always open the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green make an impressive mark in her first parliament as she campaign on issue such as knife crime the nhs and housing she speak eloquently on an issue that be close to her heart and mine care she speak movingly about how she care for her mum when she be just very young child and about how she learn at young age about all the different painkiller need to treat her mum as someone who believe that we need to hear the voice of carer in this chamber far more often it be pleasure to listen to her speech today be leave in no doubt that she will make an even big mark in her second parliament while be pay tribute let add our thank to the three lions who captivate the whole nation and come so agonisingly close to end all those year of hurt they do we proud and let we hope the lionesses retain their european crown next year welcome the prime minister to his place and congratulate he and his party on their election victory as he say they now have an enormous undertaking and we wish they well read somewhere that the prime minister apparently surf to power on wave of conservative failure but may say to he gently and with pang of envy that watersport be my thing the challenge await the new government be certainly great set against the challenge backdrop there be much to welcome in the programme set out today not least the government focus on get our economy grow strongly again the prime minister be right to say that build more home be an essential part of that as we can see from the work of many brilliant liberal democrat council from cumbria to eastleigh and in my own area the royal borough of kingston the good way to build the many extra home we need especially social and affordable home be to properly engage local people and community and bring they along with we that be the community lead approach that we on the liberal democrat benches will continue to champion be delighted to see that the leader of the liberal democrats seem to be openly advocate the work of eastleigh borough council may just remind he that the council be build double the number of house require only because his party leadership have get it into million worth of debt and it need to pay off the debt that it accrue be delighted to say that today we welcome my hon friend the member for eastleigh liz jarvis the new member for that constituency to the liberal democrat benches be sure she will have all the answer that the hon gentleman need but growth and house building be not the only challenge crucial though they be be sure that all of we across the house as we knock on door during the election campaign hear the same common refrain from people of all background and all walk of life that nothing seem to be work as it should from the health and care crisis to the sewage scandal to the cost of living the british people have overwhelmingly reject the past out of touch conservative government they have go but after so many year of be take for grant many people have simply lose faith in our political system to solve their problem we on the liberal democrat benches recognise the scale of the challenge now face the new government they have big job to do and so do we we will work hard on behalf of our constituent we will scrutinise the government plan carefully and strive to improve they and we will oppose they when we think they have get it wrong but where they act in the national interest to solve these problem and improve people life we will support they one issue that come up more than any other at door after door be sure it be the same for member of all party be the issue of health and care patient be wait week to see gp or an nhs dentist if they can find one more than million people be wait on nhs waiting list ten of thousand of cancer patient be wait month to start urgent treatment patient be stick in hospital sometimes for week ready and want to leave but unable to do so because the care home place be not there or the care worker or support for the family carer be not in place fix this crisis in our nhs be essential not only for people health and wellbeing but for the economy and for growth only if we get people off the waiting list and into work can we get our economy grow strongly again the right hon gentleman mention the delay and waiting time in the nhs and social care but how much do he regret his role in the five year he spend in coalition with the conservatives create that situation be disappoint in the hon gentleman intervention we can all go back to thing that other party do in government and say that they be wrong would just say to he that come to this task now in spirit of constructive opposition to work for the good for our country and hope that he and other members will do that too welcome number of the measure for the nhs in the king speech include on reduce waiting time and particularly on mental health want to work with the government to improve those they be long overdue of course also urge the government to look at the proposal on the nhs in our manifesto on boost gp number so everyone can get an apartment within seven day or hour if it be urgent on improve access to dentist and crucially to local pharmacist if more people can get the care they need early and locally few people go into hospital and on give cancer patient the care they deserve with cast iron guarantee that they will start treatment within two month after diagnosis this be the scale of the ambition we need for our nhs right now and hope the government will show it there be another part of this crisis that need to be fix through urgent attention and it be care speak during the election about my own caring journey first for my mum when be teenager then for my dear nana and now as emily and care for our severely disabled son john have be incredibly touch by the response from colleague across the house who have reach out to tell how important it be that we speak out on care for people who need care and for carer both professional social care worker and the family carer who be look after their love one have have the chance to hear from carer of all age all over the country as they share personal story with they include the couple who care for son with similar care need to john who reach out to say that they know what it be like to worry about what will happen when they be no long there to look after their disabled son they offer advice and be touch by their kindness and generosity each care story be so different yet in many way they have much in common we all share special wonderful bond with the one we care for and we all share the feeling that no one else understand we caring have be in the shadow for far too long let this be the parliament in which carer voice be hear and we become the caring nation caring mean people do extraordinary thing every day for the one they love often in the face of difficult circumstance physical challenge no break mountain of paperwork countless appointment and endless phone call they try to navigate broken system that be simply not design to work for carer we on the liberal democrat benches will do our very good to get fair deal for carer whether on carer allowance or on the big challenge of fix social care so that our love one get the support they need when and where they need it of course this will not be easy fix social care after year of neglect will be incredibly complicated but we can not shy away from it although it be not in the king speech be encourage by the report that the government be plan cross party commission on social care which we urgently need to find solution that stand the test of time hope we will hear more about that from the government very soon fix social care be not only essential to give people the care and dignity they deserve and to support family carer without it we can not fix our nhs it would be big enough task if health and care be the only major crisis face the government but clearly it be not inflation may have finally come down to normal level but the cost of living crisis persist family and pensioner still face record energy bill and sky high housing cost and food bill they need support and understanding which begin with the government promise to be fiscally responsible that would mark big and welcome shift from the previous government rather reckless approach to the budget with energy bill forecast to rise by in october clearly we need bold action to bring down cost from insulate home to expand renewable power the liberal democrats have proud record of invest in renewable power almost quadruple it when we run energy policy our policy drive the cost of renewable electricity below the cost of fossil fuel generate power hope the government will act with the same level of ambition to tackle not only the cost of live crisis but climate change too because urgent action be need to prevent catastrophic climate change we have show how it can be do and how do it well will benefit consumer the economy and the environment we welcome the government focus on this challenge and we will push they to meet it we will also push the government on another environmental challenge end the sewage crisis for anyone who still doubt the election campaign clearly show the strength of public anger about the pollution of our river lake and beach the government have make welcome noise about hold the water company to account and make sure they put these environmental issue before profit but the liberal democrats will push ministers to act as quickly and decisively as possible to put an end to this appalling scandal health and care the cost of living climate change and sewage these big crisis just get bad and bad over the last year of the previous government whose failure to address they be big part of why people trust in politic be so low this year british social attitude survey find that of people record high almost never trust the government to put the national interest first be sure speak for everyone in the house when hope that this government will prove that wrong but restore public trust and confidence in our politic be major task for we all right across this house no matter our party think there be two part to how we restore that trust the first be by tackle the root cause of the many scandal that have cause so much harm and do so much damage to public trust from hillsborough to horizon to infect blood we welcome the promise hillsborough law with its statutory duty of candour on public official but we urge the government to go far in this area give the vital role that whistleblower have play in expose these scandal urge ministers to look at our proposal for strong protection for blower include new office of the whistleblower the second way to restore trust be by transform our politic so they be relevant engaging and responsive to people need and dream the measure that the government have promise to strengthen democratic right and participation be therefore welcome as be the principle of shift more power out of westminster and whitehall so local decision be make by the people for they and the community they live in be sure the prime minister know that the devil be in the detail so we will scrutinise those plan carefully when they come we fear they will not go far enough it will not surprise anyone in the house to hear that we on the liberal democrat benches believe that political reform must include electoral reform proportional representation give everyone equal power to hold member of parliament properly to account maybe even the conservatives support that these day note that accord to the same survey on british social attitude the majority of the public agree with we have focus on the many big domestic challenge face we but will conclude by touch on the enormously challenging international picture from vladimir putin appal war in ukraine to the dreadful conflict in israel and gaza with the terrible humanitarian catastrophe there and hostage still be hold by hamas these be tumultuous time indeed they demand that we work together with our ally through international institution and yes that mean work constructively with our european neighbour to rebuild the tie of trust trade and friendship with our european friend that have be so badly damage by the conservatives as liberal we believe that the uk can be an incredible force for good when we stand tall on the world stage champion the vital british value of democracy liberty human right and the rule of law when the government do that they will have our full support close by pay tribute to those on the frontline of that effort our armed force deploy around the world whether secure nato flank in eastern europe combat daesh terrorist in the middle east or support peacekeeping mission in africa they serve our country with incredible courage and professionalism and we all owe they an eternal debt it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey but confess be little disappointed with he because today he walk into the chamber he could at least have try bungee jump or maybe freewheel on bicycle applaud he for his effort in the campaign they keep we all entertain and look at the number of member on the liberal democrat benches clearly pay dividend welcome and thank my hon friend who propose and second the humble address but say to my hon friend the member for bootle peter dowd that he may be the young of eight but be the second of new members of the house will hear lot about big brother but can tell they that they have big sister here to support they be sure my hon friend will support they too after year in this place know my way around bit although too still get lose so they should not be worried about that be delighted to hear the speech of my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi first come across she when she be member of the london assembly know then that she have something special about she and we see that here today draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests spend nearly decade chair the public accounts committee in this place in the last parliament and the previous two in that role see many egregious example of incompetence bungling and waste whether it be water company school building with reinforce concrete and other thing fall down the run sore of rail infrastructure the national embarrassment of defence procurement and the scandal of personal protective equipment procurement during covid time and again we see government bungle poorly draft contract lack of oversight dodged responsibility endless excuse and the taxpayer pick up the tab no wonder people be so angry at the election no wonder they vote for change and for my right hon and learn friend the prime minister now the true extent of the tory mess be come to light as my right hon friend the chancellor have reveal it be even bad than we think she have open the book look under the bonnet and see the true extent of the mess that be now for labour government to clear up the previous government partie squabble and help their mate but they do not fix the roof when the sun shine they trash the joint from austerity to the ppe scandal and trussonomics remember weaken the fundamental of our economy and stretch our public service to breaking point in my annual report which be one of my last report as the chair of the public accounts committee list what call the big nastie some of which the chancellor be reveal to we now pupil be in school that be not fit for purpose there be in fact far few new hospital than the that be much vaunted and they be never go to be deliver to the promise timetable and the gap hole in our defence budget certainly applaud the approach of this government and it seem some consensus from the opposition benches that we need to see an increase in defence spending the consequence of the mess that have be leave behind by the previous government be human accord to the house of commons library nearly one fifth of child in my borough of hackney live in absolute poverty four in child in hackney live in poverty after housing cost be take into account accord to the joseph rowntree foundation recent figure my constituency be in the top of english constituency with child who be income deprive that be the shameful legacy of year of failure in one of the world great and rich city bus ride from the financial powerhouse of liverpool street no child should be cold or hungry or lack winter coat or decent shoe school in hackney have kit room for the child who turn up without the requisite uniform and lend it for the day in return for token like their oyster card no parent should be have to skip meal to feed their kid which be happen too often in hackney and elsewhere in the country no child should be arrive at school with rumble tummy which be why welcome the breakfast club that we already have in hackney and the fact that one of the first act of this labour government will be to make sure that every child in primary school have decent breakfast when we talk about stagnant wage low productivity flattening growth lack of investment in skill and school the abolition of sure start and the gig economy there be this human cost right now in hackney school there be hungry child whose huge potential be be waste whose opportunity be stunt and whose life chance be hobble when first arrive in this place year ago have to tell people about the good thing that be go on in hackney because people have write off my borough as poor and deprived area where thing do not happen now people think of the shoreditch hipster the tech company and the city fringe but underneath that there be this huge poverty and opportunity be stunt for our child this be the mess that this government now have to clear up another example of that be the housing crisis safe warm and affordable place in which to live should be and be basic right we all need roof over our head before we can do anything else in our life whether it be study work or bring up our family yet after year my constituent face housing crisis whatever the tenure accord to hackney council the median household income in hackney be just under year yet the median house price in my constituency which have double since be for those who have not catch up on the math yet this mean that house cost more than time the median household income accord to the land registry the average first time buyer in hackney pay just under over half million pound for first time buyer well that not most first time buyer be it it be the lucky few who either have very good job or have get help from the bank of mum and dad or other family member do not deny they that help but it should be an opportunity available to all it be utterly ridiculous that we be in this situation young professional with double income be simply unable to afford deposit to get place of their own and be often stick live with family member into their other be force into rent accommodation with no security of tenure and rent so high that there be no spare money to save to get on the housing ladder accord to the work of the public accounts committee around of privately rent property pose serious threat to health so landlord be get the rent but land their tenant in hospital with lung disease mental illness or physical injury hope the chancellor ear be prick up because the public accounts committee estimate that this situation cost the nhs million year that go to the broad point economic inefficiency child poverty the housing crisis and fail public service all cost we more money the economic of decline be an expensive business but we see hope now with this labour government investment in job home school skill road the nhs and tackle crime save the public money down the line as be often say when have the honour of hold the role of chair of the public accounts committee penny of waste be theft from work people pocket and fair economy be also an efficient one warmly welcome the measure in this king speech under labour government how nice it be to say those word after year since july my colleague in the cabinet be about to say the shadow cabinet old habit die hard include labour secretaries of state have move into action from the inertia of what go before and that mean that we be on the road to recovery it be go to be long haul but welcome the measure to support start up and tech company particularly as represent shoreditch where so many be base to revive skill to modernise our health service particularly prioritise mental health to get more teacher into hackney school and crucially to build more affordable home we need many affordable home in inner london in constituency such as mine where social housing be the only option for so many people only last week woman come to my surgery who have four child in one bedroom flat and her elderly sick father have have to come to live with they that be how the family live four child in one bedroom flat and it be not uncommon at all we need to drive change to deliver housing around the country but particularly in the inner city also recognise the lead and step change in tackle the issue of net zero to decarbonise our economy with investment in renewable insulation carbon capture and green job thing have examine lot over the last decade and on which we have see the previous government fail so often above all welcome the commitment of his majesty government our labour government to kickstart growth in our economy without steady sustainable economic growth and without the proceed of growth fairly share across the nation we will continue our national decline instead in this king speech we be offer hopeful prospectus for change the prospect of progress and new sense of national renewal and hope after year we know it will not be easy nor will it be as quick as we all impatiently want it to be as former minister and have be member of the public accounts committee for year know that modernisation and reform can be frustratingly slow have see many good ambition frustrate by poor delivery if may proffer word of advice for those on the treasury bench find themselves newly surround by eager official many of whom come in front of my committee and red box it be this please stay focused look up at that horizon think of the people who send we here who vote for that change you want to deliver and we all want to see keep an eye on that guide goal of growth test every proposition that come across your desk against that simple question do this promote or hinder growth successful government as the prime minister say be mission lead of course we want to tackle poverty build home and transform our nhs but the main mission be growth because without that we can not deliver any of the other call the leader of the snp begin by congratulate the prime minister on his first king speech be sure it be an incredibly important moment for he and his family and wish he well over the month to come be sure it will be an incredibly challenging time but repeat my good wish to he and all his new colleague beside he on the government benches want to reflect first that at prime minister question on the day the election be call perhaps goad the former prime minister in respect of call general election indeed think refer to he as be feart should he not do that be not sure entirely who out of the two of we fare bad from his decision to do so maybe that be something we can both reflect upon in due course the opportunity now in front of this labour government be enormous they have parliamentary majority that will go down in history and that majority afford they something incredibly important the ability to deliver change what that change look like and perhaps more importantly what it feel like for people in their home be so important my colleague and on the snp benches will do everything we possibly can to be as constructive as we we will however be bit disappointed today not necessarily by some of the thing that be in the king speech but by some of those thing that be not in that regard bring the house attention to the amendment that my colleague and ably support by other member from across the chamber have table in relation to the two child benefit cap that iniquitous heinous policy be bring in by the former conservative government in each and every one of we in this chamber note that it retain child in poverty hundred of thousand of child across these isle in scotland alone it impact household and it be estimate that child would immediately be take out of poverty be it to be scrap but it be not mention in the government programme for government today instead all we have hear be that taskforce will be create with no timeframe for that taskforce and no indication when it will conclude all the while those child will remain in poverty surely it should be the bare minimum expectation of labour government that they would seek to do everything they possibly can immediately to lift child out of poverty and be particularly interested in the view of scottish members of parliament from the labour party in this regard could the hon gentleman explain to the house why the snp government in scotland who have the power to do that have not would be more than happy to enlighten the hon gentleman in that regard as he know in the uk we have reserve policy and we have devolve policy and some of welfare policy be reserve to this parliament the scottish government have seek over recent year to mitigate the bad excess of the conservatives with some million worth of money that we could spend on other thing we choose to mitigate tory policy include of course the like of the bedroom tax be sure he would be keen to see those on his own front bench mitigate and end that particular policy however we do that within the confine of the financial remit set in large part by this place if the hon gentleman be suggest and be sure some of his scottish colleague would agree with he that the scottish government should mitigate he and the government should outline where that money should come from should it come from scotland nhs our school our police or our budget for young people the reality be that the constraint place upon scotland by this place do not afford we the opportunity to mitigate and frankly find it absurd and deeply disingenuous to suggest that the remit of scotland parliament should be to mitigate westminster our horizon should be so much great than that return to the point that be make scottish labour members supposedly agree with the scottish national party that the two child cap should and must be scrap so how will they vote will they follow the lead of their prime minister in london or will they follow the lead of the leader in scotland and respect the view of the people they be send here to represent despite my great disappointment there be one area in which hope the prime minister can put smile on my face gb energy be moderately surprised that we have not yet have an announcement that it be to be headquarter in aberdeen perhaps in the aberdeen south constituency that represent indeed aberdeen and grampian chamber of commerce hire van that have be patrol the street outside parliament today call for it to come home that be the only time will ever use those word and it should come home straight to the energy capital of europe although would welcome gb energy placement in aberdeen also want to see much more detail about what it will deliver if have read correctly cumulative billion will go towards gb energy over the next five billion each and every year but one hydro pump storage project in scotland would almost blow that entire budget apart we know that gb energy will not sell energy we know that it will not distribute energy and it appear that it will not generate energy it have be suggest that it will be an investment vehicle for project to go forward but if it be cap at billion year must question the government ambition how do that deliver the change that be require the change that they previously agree to require some billion each and every year what contrast with the ambition that they once have of course net zero will be absolutely crucial to our economic future to the growth and prosperity that we all want but ultimately that growth can come about only through productivity would like to hear more from the labour government who have significant majority about what they will do to reverse some of the conservative party policy on migration migration dramatically and drastically impact on high education institution in scotland and in the constituency of each and every labour member we know that university be key driver of productivity wish to seek consensus across the house on migration which might be moderately difficult give some of the people who now sit behind we need to stand up and be bold and brave in the face of those who seek to demonise migration and other those who come to work in our public and private sector care for we in our hospital and teach our child we should seek to increase migration increase our economic output grow our economy and enhance our community brave politician would do that and hope that labour members share that bravery of course our economy be not just about net zero productivity or migration it be also intrinsically link to our relationship with the european union look forward to see what the government come forward with in respect of their propose new relationship with our friend and ally in europe we should be seek to rejoin the european single market we should be seek to rejoin the european custom union it make sense to all of we the politician in this house be afraid of do so but they will come to realise that the only way to achieve the aim that they want to achieve be to do just that on all those issue and so many more we will seek to be voice of reason in this house and to work constructively with government members over the come hour and day look forward to hear their contribution and what they intend to bring to our national discourse as we all try to improve the life of the people who we be so fortunate to represent gently say to members that we have lot to get in today so would be very grateful if they try to keep speech below or up to eight minute add my commendation for the speech that introduce this debate have only one anecdote about my hon friend the member for bootle peter dowd who be in my treasury team he be fan of shostakovich and on one occasion we go to the royal albert hall to listen to shostakovich symphony it be the symphony with which dmitri shostakovich upset stalin and it almost cost he his life we think the performance be superb but there be two grumpy old man in front of we and at the end of the symphony one turn to the other and say stalin may have have point we enjoy it think the speech today be superb want to get to the business of the next few day examine the king speech we all come to this house with mandate from our constituent so it important that we bring to the house their experience when the exit poll land on election night in my community there be almost collective sigh of relief that we be end year of conservative government my constituency like many other my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier have say this could not take any more to be frank in my constituency like that of my hon friend one in three child be live in poverty accord to the statistic some of they be live in destitution have get housing crisis even though property be be build in the centre of my constituency most of my constituent can not afford they those who have scrap the money together and have get leaseholder access to those property be now be hit by massive increase in service charge and some of they want to hand the key back have get rent spiral out of all control and have get slum housing reappearing the back to back have be reinvent in my constituency where one family will rent the front of normal house and another family will rent another floor or the back turn to employment for my constituent wage have virtually be freeze for the past year have heathrow in my constituency people would fight to get job at heathrow because the wage be so good but not any more we be run low pay campaign and insecure work be endemic in my constituency it be heathrow ltd that start fire and rehire the same could be say about public service we will all say this in my area the nhs be on its knee just do not know how the staff have cop in the teaching profession the stress be such that we can not retain teacher no matter how committed they be they do not survive under that sort of pressure for many of our area social care be almost non existent and meet family member who be care for other family member and unpaid carer it be now almost inevitable that if you be look after someone in your family someone who have disability or whatever you be live in poverty as result of the lack of support yes people vote for change but we on the labour benches have to be realistic and have some humility in our assessment of the election only one in five of the population vote for we and what worry in my constituency be that our turnout have go from when be elect in the to in this election we need to be wary of that and to understand the reason for it the more in common poll that be publish this week confirm the scale of disillusionment that there be with politic overall which have be reflect in some of today debate my fear be that we now have other on the political scene in this country and elsewhere who will feed on that disillusionment we should guard against the far right mobilising again as have happen in germany france and italy we as labour government have to deliver as for all government the honeymoon will inevitably be short live but welcome the king speech because it do set out the element of programme for rebuild our country must say that there be element have to smile over in that much have be draw from the and manifesto but maybe we should not mention that such as on employment right the new deal rail nationalisation bus great british energy and the national investment fund which reflect the national investment bank that we put forward then in fact there be section of the king speech that could almost be the work of my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald people want and expect delivery soon rather than later want to focus on four area of policy on which be desperate to see change the first be poverty child poverty have to be our priority there be million people live in poverty include million child with million in destitution never think that in my lifetime we would ever debate destitution again in this house but destitution there be welcome the announcement today of the taskforce that will look at poverty overall but have to say that set up taskforce be one thing and acting be another there be one simple act and we all know it that could lift child out of poverty this month scrap the two child limit be in this house when the tories introduce it and it be introduce as part of stigmatise all those on benefit in my speech say that would swim through vomit to vote against the report july vol give some of the speech from the tories at the time almost have to it be an appalling form of attack on the poor in our community we need to lift that stigma that impact but we need to do it quickly yes let we set up taskforce by all mean but we must produce timetable that within week we will scrap the two child limit the argument be whether we can afford it and whether it will be within our fiscal rule many member will know that over the last few week the obr have lift or revise its growth figure upwards the international monetary fund have dramatically increase the growth figure upwards that have nothing to do with the tories build new economy or anything like that it be the natural business cycle and it be also part and parcel of some company recognise that labour government be come let we take the benefit of that it be no long an offence against the fiscal rule the resource be there and we can lift those poor child out of poverty with this simple act so appeal to my own party to the labour front bench to by all mean get the taskforce work but to now commit ourselves to scrap the two child limit and do it rapidly on employment the new deal for worker which we develop when we be in opposition be now go to be legislate on want no more water down and at the same time do not want it delay by endless consultation we have consult at length for five year nearly it be there and it be ready we want to scrap fire and rehire and we want to scrap zero hour contract but one of the most important ingredient of that legislation should be the extension of sectoral collective pay bargaining so far we have commit to do that in the social care sector and welcome it because that be where poverty wage really be be pay however we now need to start as we promise before to extend that across the economy we can build into the bill the mechanism for do that stage by stage yes with discussion and so on but it can be do effectively in some area sectoral collective bargaining be scrap only few year ago for example in agriculture one area in which would like to ensure that we have that be transport and then we would have no more we need to be honest about the state of our public service in term not only of their delivery but of their finance do report last september with andrew fischer on the incoming labour government in tray it be calculate that between and now the conservatives cut billion no one expect that billion to be discover overnight but we need plan for reinvestment over the length of this parliament that mean be honest about the debate that we must have about not just this budget but future budgets people recognise that we will need to find the money yes we will get some from growth but of growth bring in about billion to achieve of growth be hard work it require investment and it take time if we can get back up to fine but that will take time in the meantime we need the resource for our public service and that mean that we have to have an honest debate about taxation and the distribution of wealth in our country it mean for example that we need to grasp the nettle of level capital gain tax with income tax make sure that our tax relief and the corporate welfare that be go on be effective and not simply subsidise profit in addition believe we must have discussion at some stage about what we do about wealth distribution overall there have be lot of discussion about reform of public service agree with that but want reform to be place in the hand of the frontline staff themselves the expert in deliver the service and for they to then work with the recipient of those service the patient and other so that there be co production the disability movement have develop the theme of nothing about we without we and that should apply to every sector of public service so that we work not just with those who deliver the service but with those who receive it also agree with what have be say about unpaid carer and the way in which we treat disabled people who be afraid now live in poverty and be stigmatise under the previous government we can come to those debate as we run to the next budget my conclusion be carpe diem seize the moment we have large majority we must beware the danger of the far right mobilising if we fail but we must also recognise the potential that we now have finally do not know what it be like in other constituency but overhang our whole debate be the humanitarian crisis in gaza come in night after night and see more child be slaughter and war crime be commit do not think we will solve this problem unless we seek an immediate ceasefire that will enable we to have the hostage release however think we can take some immediate step stop the arm sale to israel respect the international criminal court and ensure that we recognise that war crime should be punish since january try to mobilise the previous government to accept as other government across the world have be do seriously injure child from gaza so that they could come here for treatment but not one visa have be issue to palestinian child for that purpose have write to the foreign secretary and the home secretary and hope that our government can welcome those child here so that they can receive the treatment they need before hopefully they can be return to palestinian state that we recognise and that live in peace it be pleasure to see you in the chair this afternoon mr deputy speaker and an honour to speak so early in this debate and to follow the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell his speech be precede by the contribution of two opposition party leader the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey and for aberdeen south stephen flynn they all demonstrate that you can not keep good parliament down mr deputy speaker we already have the liberal democrats try to rerun the referendum on proportional representation the scottish national party want to rerun the referendum on brexit and of course on scottish independence and encourage the right hon member for hayes and harlington to continue healthy debate about matter such as the two child policy because his speech have just bring into question the argument that the big someone majority the more control they have over their party look forward to an entertaining parliament in that respect this be my first opportunity to draw the house attention to report produce by the liaison committee in its die moment in the previous parliament it be actually publish after parliament have rise but before dissolution about strategic thinking in government ask myself whether the king speech reflect comprehensive strategic thinking in government think it do in part but certainly not in other it be significant moment when newly elect government gracious speech be deliver because that be when the rhetoric of the campaigning hit the reality of govern how strategic be this government much of the speech be good budget responsibility and the prioritising of wealth creation be good thing but how be that to be achieve with enhance employment right which we know be threat to the flexibility of the labour market and which business be already warn will destroy job what about all the new sup quango which be rather an echo of labour government past what about new great british railways like the fail strategic rail authority under john prescott what about new great british energy do not suppose that be go to be quite like the old central electricity generating board but the limit on its authority and spending power make it rather less significant as the snp leader the right hon member for aberdeen south point out what about new industrial strategy council which be rather like the unlamented national enterprise board set up by tony benn in the prime minister claim that this be nothing less than national renewal but suggest that these be little more than the recycling of old fail idea do not think lords reform be go to be first term priority for labour government it be probably just red meat for few labour mp there be to be new house of commons modernisation committee but that be year out of date the house of commons modernise itself without have modernisation committee be that really deserve of such prominence in king speech as strategic priority of the government the government appear to be deaf to the irony of the conflict within their own programme they say that great devolution of decision making be at the heart of modern dynamic economy and welcome that but it be only to do thing like take control of bus it be certainly not to take control of where the house be build and of the housing target in different area welcome the commitment to speed up infrastructure investment to that extent hope the government will welcome the inheritance from the previous government of the freeport particularly the harwich and felixstowe one in my constituency that freeport be an initiative that the government should be pleased to advance it have the support of all the political party in harwich which be commit to its success give the new government commitment to funding infrastructure look forward to meet the new minister to discuss how we can develop the bathside bay to generate industry and job for local people think the government will find that the norwich to tilbury pylon proposal be less welcome inheritance welcome their objective to unlock investment in energy infrastructure but would like to assist with that because it do not mean that the government must blindly approve of anything that national grid produce at first flush and think be good idea the norwich to tilbury pylon proposal have be much in the national news because of the local campaign against the desecration of unspoiled countryside this be not opposition for its own sake the submission that will make later this week in response to the current consultation will set out how the objective for norwich to tilbury can not be achieve with the current proposal and can be achieve more quickly and at low lifetime cost than that of the current proposal despite what the prime minister try to insist be his programme it be still dominate by the short term tactic of gain power and retain it we hear that in his jibe at the conservative party rather than address the fundamental challenge that threaten our national survival and put it at no less than that what be those challenge they can be summarise as the six big ds debt digitisation which be transform the way we live our life decarbonisation deglobalisation which have throw globalisation into reverse as result of the pandemic and rise international tension demographic which be afflict every oecd country and defence very much welcome the appointment of lord robertson to help oversee bipartisan defence review it will find that we need to commit far more than of gdp to defence to help prevent another major war urge hon member to keep think about ukraine be very glad the prime minister mention it in his remark if russia succeed in ukraine we can say goodbye to european and transatlantic security one of the finding of the liaison committee report on strategic thinking in government be that long term strategy can be truly sustain only if it last across successive parliaments and periodic change in government what come to mind include continuous at sea deterrence the counter terrorism strategy the operation of gchq and indeed the survival and continuation of the national health service and the achievement of net zero hope that the government will use their considerable majority to offer to make the radical reform which for example the nhs need by find the cross party consent and consensus need to drive through such reform as they will undoubtedly create division in both party the government have an unrivalled opportunity finally to tackle the social care question but if we want it to stick it must be agree across the house the report cover the capacity of whitehall for strategic thinking how the centre of government can lead strategy more effectively how strategy must engage the public particularly young generation in govern for the future and how scrutiny by select committees can promote strategic thinking in government very much hope that if right hon and hon member have not already read just the first chapter of the report they will do so because it be manifesto for how parliament and government should work together to help promote the kind of country that we want which be so threaten by the international event that we see see ministers sagely nod and appreciate that but the government have yet to respond to the report there be two proposal in it that very much hope they will adopt one be that they will recreate national school for government to train our civil servant and spad and even members of parliament in what strategic thinking really be instead of just scrabble around with focus group and opinion poll to tell we what to do the other be that the house should establish committee for the future as be happen in other parliaments around the world we draw lot on international experience which should be look much far ahead than most select committees have time to look that would be great reform for the government to bring in it be real pleasure to speak in the king speech debate set out labour new programme for government after year of disastrous tory government it be also an honour to take part as the mp for the new constituency of widnes and halewood in which be bear and breed the prime minister have make it clear that the labour government will be one of service with clear mandate to deliver the change that the country desperately need the king speech show that labour plan to govern with serious solution labour will make the difficult decision need to fix the basic problem face the country be really pleased that we have make growth central plank of the government policy include of course the development of an incredible industrial strategy we must also address the serious and long term productivity problem that the country have face hope that the new government will get on to that quickly because it be really hold we back the new labour government of ours have daunting job in tackle the many challenge face the country after year of mismanagement of our economy epitomise by the disastrous liz truss budget as well as the run down and underfunding of our public service the nhs and social care be in crisis with people die because of delay in treatment wait in hospital corridor be now the norm local authority be also struggle to remain financially viable rather than stick our head in the sand or pull the wool over people eye as the tories do labour will be

to reduce suicide particularly among young man welcome any change and involvement from the government lot have be say about planning but high street have not really be mention many of we in our constituency face real issue with high street which have be under massive pressure with many shop close down there be need for renewal and regeneration hope that the planning bill will look at that welcome the reform of bus service particularly over the past to year many community have become more isolated because bus service have be cancel or reduce hope that with this change in policy we can make some improvement to the many community who feel isolated across this country not least in my constituency in the king speech the government make clear commitment to nato they say that it remain unshakeable and that they will retain strong armed force include nuclear deterrent welcome that from the prime minister and the government the strategic defence review which have be commission by the prime minister and will be oversee by the defence secretary be very welcome as root and branch review those of we who have be around here for some time and have have to put up with conservative government who have let down the armed force put this country defence and security at risk will welcome this review we must look at the situation we have the small army since napoleonic time even previous conservative secretary of state say that the armed force have be hollow out we have shortage of munition there be major problem with procurement and waste money which need to be address be sure that they will be priority of this new government the focus have always be and will continue to be on ukraine and be pleased to see the commitment to ukraine in the king speech we face real problem with russia china and north korea and the threat they pose to world order and to democracy in particular these be some big challenge that we must get to grip with we must look again at our armed force and how we can improve they get well funding and importantly ensure that the funding they get be spend correctly and efficiently and not waste that be important for the future commend the hon gentleman for what he say about the armed force in northern ireland we have always have large recruitment both to the regular force and to the territorial do he agree that when it come to recruitment for northern ireland extra money should be make available to ensure that those who want to join can do so understand the hon member pitch for extra resource for northern ireland but think he will recognise that there be now major recruitment crisis in the armed force that have be ongoing for many year it be not just an issue of recruitment it be also about retain good experienced people that be what we have to really focus on be sure the defence review will look at that it be also about look after our service personnel ensure that they have well housing and well facility and that their pay be right and ensure that we have proper service and support for our veteran agree with he that recruitment be challenge we have to sort that out because it be weaken our armed force know that time be get on so just want to say couple of thing in conclusion we still have cost of living crisis living standard be low at the end of the last parliament than they be at the beginning of the last parliament and the tax burden be at its high rate for year our first king speech will be downpayment just the start of the legislative plan that labour will set out over the next five year to transform our country we will need to be patient and have focus work over long period of time as the prime minister have make clear this will be government of service that will do thing differently and properly rather than gimmick and bills that do not work labour will be focus on real change for work people it be good to take part in this debate on the loyal address in particular it be good to see his majesty attend the house today wish he well in his recovery and pay tribute to his record of service to our nation congratulate all new member who have enter the house thank the proposer and the seconder of the motion the hon member for bootle peter dowd and for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi who be no long in their place it be fair to say this be note for all new member as well as exist member that their speech be make in the fine tradition of the house the start of the parliament be one of the few moment we have to unite to respect each other speech and contribution and to become accustomed to the tradition formality and convention of the house at the same time we get to do the great thing that we all love represent our constituent for new member in particular this will become the regular pattern of their work in this house and reflection of the hard graft that go in we have all come fresh from general election campaign where lot of graft be put in but we be now here elect to represent our constituent in the normal tradition on the issue that may sometimes divide we but where we can advance their cause through legislation want to begin my contribution on the loyal address by say few word about the new government tone over the past day it be an inevitable feature of new government that they spend their first few week continue campaign rhetoric we will hear it lot and talk down the record of the previous government however much be advanced over the last year we be proud of our record and the transformation we lead include on public finance these be big thing that do not just happen over few week and month we be proud that we transform the public finance from the government borrow in every to much well fiscal position today it be not easy to get into these fiscal position and those on the labour benches should reflect on the fiscal position they inherit we be proud of support the creation of job per day on average have fast economic growth than many of our competitor cut the tax burden on income and fuel duty oversee an increase in doctor and nurse work in our nhs more teacher school raise standard and on law and order get more police officer on our street fight crime that be record we be proud of it be important to reflect on that if may say so in very subtle gentle and polite way to those now on the government front bench it be all very well try to rewrite history through slogan it sometimes take attention away from the responsibility of have to govern and make the big decision and choice let touch on some policy area the government have already present programme in one area of which have some experience have be home secretary for more than three year we have hear quite bit about immigration and crime but although we have not see the detail what we have hear from the government so far differ little from some of the measure that be already in place one example be the propose uk border security command which we actually set up just over four year ago to co operate with international partner some of my colleague who follow in the home office will recognise much of this they will recognise the need to take action in the english channel and work with our intelligence and security agency in order to do so and they will recognise the appointment of clandestine channel threat commander and the establishment of joint interagency task force because they happen under the last government want to commend the work of our international law enforcement agency and our international partner not only do they work at an exceptional level but they work to save life and think we should reflect on that because only last week we see more life lose in the channel we also introduce robust measure to tackle criminal gang and county line and put together safe street policy together to protect our constituent but some of those measure be oppose by those who be now in government when they sit on these benches it be important to recognise that some thing do not happen overnight there be no single solution to some of these issue but through collaboration we can drive the right outcome we hear the prime minister speak about law and order today and welcome many of his comment about the importance of safe street and tackle terrorism but also the need to address those appalling problem that we still see and will continue to see violence on our street and domestic abuse with victim suffer at the hand of criminal none of we want prisoner to be release early but it be important to focus on the victim of crime and to have the right punishment in place to ensure that the perpetrator be give tough sentence again note that those measure be oppose in the last parliament it be important for we to get fairness back into our system when it come to law and order one of the great achievement of the last government be the expansion of renewable energy generation we can be proud of our record in that regard and proud to be world leader give that the energy generate by mix of renewable pass the mark that be huge improvement on the situation in my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin have already touch on the question of how we can generate new technology for energy purpose and genuinely believe that technology rather than taxation be the path to much more sustainable future think that our colleague in the government will recognise the reality of some of the project that already exist and will now be dominate their inboxe such as the national grid attempt through its norwich to tilbury plan to impose more than mile of pylon and overheard power line across the east of england it be press those proposal but my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex and be work to find alternative through technology and way in which we can upgrade the grid without destroy the east anglian countryside national grid plan will affect farmer and community facility such as white notley football club which will lose community pitch if the pylon be build across our constituency that will mean huge loss of local amenity which be deeply concern my constituent and constituent throughout essex and east anglia want to see alternative such as an offshore grid or the use of more tunnelling to build up grid infrastructure capacity the propose infrastructure and planning bill will be consider in great detail it must receive the right level of scrutiny along with the legislation on planning and new housing and we must ensure that local view the view of our constituent be not simply disregarded be aware that those on the government front bench be already propose consultation in this area if may give they some subtle and gentle advice listen to the view express in that consultation will be incredibly important because this be not about say that people do not want home in fact constituency such as mine have put forward so many plan for new home we have actually build over new family home over the last decade which have help my constituency to become very good commuter town and successful when it come to school family want to move to our area but it be case of get the balance right that be incredibly important in the minute have leave want to make point about economic growth of course everybody across the country and in this house fundamentally believe in secure high level of economic growth which every government want name government who do not want that we want more job we want more job creation and we want more successful business but it be about be on the side of business and how we can effectively support they to employ people over of my constituent be employ by small and medium sized business we be incredibly proud of that but the minute that more regulatory burden come upon those business be afraid they will lose the ability to grow and to employ local people of course small business be the backbone of our economy on day like today when we see new bills come forward through the loyal address and the king speech it be right that we be give the appropriate time to scrutinise they as we go forward through this session of parliament fundamentally however we need to make sure that as his majesty loyal opposition we member of parliament on this side of the chamber provide scrutiny but also redress to ensure that constituent voice be hear whether on planning development or economic growth fundamentally we need to make sure that britain advance in the right way call kirith entwistle to make her maiden speech thank you mr deputy speaker and thank the right hon member for witham priti patel for her contribution to the debate congratulate my hon friend the members for bootle peter dowd

bolsover he ask if be here on work experience and everyone laugh have few more grey hair now year on and have just be through difficult general election in north nottinghamshire want to begin by say special thank you to my constituent for do the great honour and privilege of re elect all the more so on what be clearly difficult night for my party during this parliament will represent my constituent with all of my vim and vigour have serve as minister under each of the last five prime ministers know what special privilege it be to serve as minister so wish our successor in office all good wish and good luck in the year ahead as patriot we all know that this government success be our success and we want they to tackle the great challenge face our country want they to enjoy their time in ministerial office as much as do the general election make number of thing clear to be deeply proud of many of our government achievement which will fiercely defend in the month and year ahead we take bankrupt country and right our public service and public finance we ensure decade of good employment after inherit high unemployment particularly among young people we lead europe in the defence of ukraine we reform our education system and we now outstrip country all over the world in the literacy and numeracy of our child we be one of the world great country in tackle environmental challenge decarbonise fast than any other country for those and other reason will always defend the record of the last conservative government but will come on to some of the lesson have learn from their failing be the right hon gentleman suggest that voter be ungrateful on july can not quite hear the hon gentleman if he be ask whether the electorate be wrong the answer be no no politician should ever doubt the electorate but it be right that we defend the thing we do well in government so that there be proper diagnosis of what we get right and what we get wrong think we do get some thing wrong we promise to get brexit do when we stand in and we do we get brexit do and restore our sovereignty as nation which be great and lasting achievement but we also promise that we would secure our border and that we would ensure strong economy low taxis and strong nhs and public service which the public rightly expect on those count we do not deliver the public service the low taxis the economic growth and the migration system that we promise and the public rightly expect the baton now pass to this labour government where they succeed will welcome and support they and where they fall short will challenge they we want to ensure that the great issue face our country be properly address we live in one of the great time to be alive but it be time of immense change there be power shift from west to east and new technology like artificial intelligence be upending old industry it be an age of mass migration which be challenge the pace of change in our country create huge pressure on housing public service and integration and make it hard to build the united country that we all want to see worry that this king speech fall short on some of those great challenge there be undoubtedly bills that welcome and be delighted that the new government be take forward the bill for holocaust memorial project in which have be involve for many year some of the bills be radical such as the change to our energy policy and worry that they be radical for all the wrong reason despite have decarbonise fast than other country and despite be responsible for only of global emission we now find ourselves with government pursue for ideological reason net zero policy that will make it hard for our own consumer to afford their bill the policy will far erode our industrial base and leave we in hock to chinese technology we be trade dependence on russian hydrocarbon for dependence on chinese electric vehicle smart meter and solar panel that will despoil our countryside new quango such as great british energy will spring up serve no apparent purpose and take inspiration from predecessor such as robin hood energy in nottingham in my part of the world that fail project waste million of taxpayer money worry that job in the oil and gas sector have be put in danger in the first few day of this government at time when they be rightly say that they want to fuel our economy create job and change the dynamic that the country have see since the financial crash and after or year of low productivity growth and unsatisfactory economic growth we should all be work to find way to do that and to make that possible worry about the message we be hear on the economy we want economic growth but economic growth be found on harness the entrepreneurship of our people it be about create start up country and help small business people to find business around their kitchen table like my parent do it be not statist vision of this country it be not about use new quango or national wealth fund which be an oxymoron because it be go to borrow the money it seek to invest it be not about change our employment law which will make we less competitive and drive the kind of high structural level of unemployment we see in europe that we have mercifully avoid over the last year and worry about immigration because we live in an age of mass migration have be honest painfully honest about the failing of the last government on this topic but worry that the same or bad mistake be about to be make again what we be see in the channel be national security emergency we be see ten of thousand of people about whom we know next to nothing cross into our country break into our country in flagrant abuse of our law some of they be subject of interest be follow by our security service this have to stop scrap the only know credible deterrent with nothing else to put in its place be go to surrender to the people smuggle gang that be wrong it be mistake and worry that we be go to rue the day that we do that also hope that the government will take legal migration seriously we have to accept that the public in most part of our country have be vote for or year in election and referendum for government that promise to control and reduce the level of legal migration only for government of all political colour to do precisely the opposite that be immensely corrosive to public trust and confidence in politic and in democracy as one of our colleague say early about the rise of far right party around the world if we centrist party on the left and the right do nothing about this we will see the rise of far right party in this country that would be great mistake hope the reform start to reduce the number of people come into this country legally be take forward and that we far reduce those number we could have use the king speech today to implement legal cap on net migration embed by parliament in law we have not do that which will mean further pressure on housing public service and the pace of change let close with this the prime minister have say he want this to be new era in which politic be define by service think we will all agree on that point it should be but the question be who do we serve do not think we come to this place to serve the interest of new quango commission and review the legal fraternity in contested notion of international law or the new and worrying rise in sectarian politic represent in this house for the first time in my lifetime which again should worry we we be send here to serve the interest of our constituent choose they choose to ensure the work people of newark and nottinghamshire be always represent they send here with few clear message secure our border reduce immigration lower our taxis stop the crime build home build more united country cohesive and integrated not riddle by the poison of left wing identity politic that be what be here to fight where this government do that and live up to that test will support they where they do not will fiercely challenge they today king speech have lay before we an ambitious and exciting vision that will benefit our country and my preston constituent for decade to come in particular welcome the announcement that the government will be introduce new publicly own company great british energy as first step it will take back control of our energy supply produce cheap power for our country and ensure that profit go back into our community as co operative party mp want to see more community energy company base on the co operative model not only will great british energy generate clean energy but it will cut energy bill and deliver good job this news come when our constituent be desperately in need of support for too long they have be expose to the energy insecurity create under the previous government which have see cost of live crisis and bill skyrocket to eye watering price every family and business in britain be still pay the price of year of conservative failure with sky high energy bill the conservatives have squander our advantage in clean energy and leave the country dangerously expose to international energy market manipulate by dictator such as vladimir putin under labour plan oil and gas giant that have make record profit from energy insecurity in this country will now be hold accountable windfall tax on their excess profit will benefit the entire nation lift the burden off the public work alongside the private sector we have the opportunity to double onshore wind triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by that investment in renewable energy be an investment in our future we need to harness the advantage of our long coastline along with our engineering capability to become energy independent again we need to invest in carbon capture and storage hydrogen and marine energy to ensure that we have the long term energy storage that our country need we need to accelerate investment in energy infrastructure that can be achieve by the government green prosperity plan which involve invest in cut edge green technology to create job in the industry of the future by the previous government be slip more and more towards climate denial but it be critical now more than ever that the uk commit to our future by do all that we can to achieve net zero set good example to the rest of the world have be extremely fortunate to experience first hand the progress that have be make on that over the year as someone who work as professional electrical engineer before enter full time politic have always be very conscious of energy consumption issue and their impact on the environment also serve as member of the european parliament where sit on the environment and consumer protection committee where we help to develop the european emission trading scheme be strongly in favour of clean energy and our mission to move towards clean energy transition as matter of urgency under the previous government sit on the energy security and net zero committee from its inception where work with colleague to hold the then government to account and focus on the issue so acutely feel by the public particularly their soar energy cost during the blair year as parliamentary private secretary to the former member for derby south during her three year as the environment secretary in the cabinet become extremely aware of the crucial importance of reduce emission as quickly as possible indeed when the former member for derby south become foreign secretary she achieve the huge goal of place climate change on to the un security council agenda for the first time since then the seriousness and urgency of the global challenge of climate change have only accelerate it be not just green issue now it be security issue be proud and energise by the fact that this government be commit to tackle climate change and do so in way that bring the public with we and encourage international collaboration by create job and opportunity that stimulate the economy and slash energy bill we be ensure that together we can become clean energy superpower become energy independent reach our net zero goal and secure our future for generation to come may say what privilege it be to follow the hon member for preston sir mark hendrick and to stand here not only as return representative elect to continue my representation of my home constituency but as the leader of unionism in northern ireland to have the opportunity to speak for the people of northern ireland in our national parliament with the endorsement not only of my constituent but of colleague right across the province it be real privilege and be pleased to do it during this loyal address and response to his majesty gracious speech mr deputy speaker you know that the election bring with it some challenge we do not have two of our colleague that would have like to have be here with we today thank both ian and paul for their contribution and service to national politic and to politic more broadly in northern ireland but we be not without hope and it be very clear that the addition to the parliamentary team even though not of our party will make significant contribution to life in their constituency in northern ireland and to this place in respond to this loyal address and gracious speech the first thing to say be that we hold his majesty responsible for not one bit of it it be of course the agenda of this government and if you be to ask someone in rural ireland for direction you might find they respond would start from here as read through the king speech welcome the commitment to repeal the provision of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act and say that as somebody who over the last nine year and alongside colleague who have be here for long have be consistent in our approach to issue of legacy in northern ireland that be not something that everyone in this chamber can say over the last number of year we appreciate the opposition that those on the labour benches offer in the face of the conservative government pursuit of the legacy act we appreciate the response from labour colleague when they recognise that the removal of the pursuit of justice be obnoxious to victim people who lose the opportunity to pursue answer and outcome on behalf of their love one but the corruption of justice in northern ireland commence decade ago the early release of prisoner be corruption of justice the on the run legislation ill fated though it be be corruption of justice and the letter of comfort indicate to terrorist that they would not face prosecution be corruption of justice be well aware that this evening the prime minister be due to meet the taoiseach of ireland simon harris and that as part of this king speech he have indicate very clearly that he be keen to reset relation that be important we should have good relation with our near neighbour but want to take this opportunity to say very clearly that the corruption of justice have now be highlight by the government we have commitment from they that they be go to act upon it and that should mean that we have an engagement base on honesty with the government of the irish republic and that there should be gentle and encourage challenge to say that they have fail in their responsibility on legacy when the court have determine that the irish government should bring forward inquiry as to what role be play by their state actor by an garda síochána and by other involve within their territory there have be silence in fact all we have have over recent year from the irish government be case against the uk government on this legislation so let balance it up if the engagement this evening be to be fruitful if there be to be positive outcome on what be good commitment and commitment that we welcome then it must be to ask our near neighbour to play their part in ensure truth and justice commend my right hon friend and colleague for what he have say when it come to responsibility the republic of ireland should be hold accountable for the fact that it give sanctuary to the ira terrorist who murder my cousin in december and lexie cummings and escape across the border there be something wrong with the government in the republic of ireland in particular if they can give sanctuary to ira murderer and killer and they think they can get away with it be very grateful to my hon friend for that comment move on to public service over the last number of year we have be campaign about the fact that public service in northern ireland be constrain because the barnett formula have not serve we well and we have be get less than what the independent fiscal commission for northern ireland and the northern ireland fiscal council have accept that we need therefore year on year public service be be reduce in northern ireland and year on year we be not get the sort of uplift require to ensure that our constituent benefit from devolution new members of this house will probably not have experience the protract agony around devolution in northern ireland and the importance of get it restore five month ago but one part of that restoration be ensure that sufficient public finance be available there be key opportunity though not mention in this king speech hope it be something the incoming government will focus on to draw upon the lesson of the holtham commission in wales and upon the positive uplift there to provide we with what we need to reform and transform public service at the moment the challenge be not about how we grow and develop the provision for our people irrespective of their community background in northern ireland but about what special school we close what hospital we close and what service we stop provide as somebody who speak for our corner of the united kingdom in this place ask for earnest engagement on public service and public funding in northern ireland devolution be restore on the basis of an agreement that we reach with the previous government but that agreement be support by labour in february of this year the safeguard the union document which allow devolution to be restore contain within it key and significant commitment and we look forward to the new labour government honour they their member support it at the time in february they know its importance while see reference in the king speech to reset relation with the european union as say early we should have good relationship and we should build upon those good relationship with near neighbour we need to carefully nurture the arrangement that be agree in february and need to be deliver this be about remove barrier within our own country we can focus on relationship with other outside and we should but not to the detriment of that which make this country work there be opportunity on regional connectivity and to build on the union connectivity review the propose creation of council for the region and border look quite like the east west council that be agree back in february as part of the safeguard the union document we will have to study the detail if it be rename and re badge that be fine but we need to talk about how we move people and product from one part of our country to another where be the connectivity review work on the move from northern ireland into scotland and down towards carlisle how do we think about this as national endeavour there will be newly elect scottish members of parliament on the labour benches who will take keen interest in ensure that the union work across the united kingdom and we want to play our part in that have spend the last eight year on the select committee on defence have speak many time of the contribution of thales from my constituency and the next generation light anti tank weapon and how important they be in the initial week of the defence of kyiv particularly and ukraine more generally however the eye have be take off the ball on support for those industry that be key within my constituency and important for northern ireland as whole in the defence sphere hon member will have see negative briefing in the last hour around harland wolff want to see very clear commitment from this government that they believe in the contract that have be award to belfast and in the renaissance of shipbuilding in belfast that they adhere to the commitment of the national shipbuilding review to building skill and opportunity throughout our united kingdom and that irrespective of the up and down high and low of any individual company the aspiration and the economic benefit of retain shipbuilding and grow the shipbuilding capacity in belfast be highly important so too be the issue of boeing wish to bring spirit aerosystems back into its company significant issue arise from that for the economy of belfast and northern ireland as spirit aerosystems be the large private employer with high skilled manufacturing job in my constituency but it service the entirety of the united kingdom like previous business secretaries the government need to focus on that be not suggest that they be not but there be huge

will help it to become great still this morning king speech be different sort of gracious speech from that to which some of we in this house be accustomed it be hearten to hear some positive proposal that look forward to debate such as measure to address the need for long overdue improvement to employment right reform to the archaic house of lords and the extension of vat to private school particularly look forward to work together on the issue relate to violence against woman and girl and be very interested to hear the prime minister name some activist in this area put on record the name of rhianon bragg of rhosgadfan in my constituency and the work she have be do after the experience she suffer at the hand of her offender would also like to mention elfyn llwyd my predecessor and the work that he do on stalk legislation which hope we will be able to strengthen however consider labour message of change be disappoint not to hear about legislation to address the inadequate funding framework which leave we short change in wales we have hear of course about the situation in the north of ireland where believe further step have be take than have be take in wales while labour government in wales have be distract by internal party politic plaid cymru have reiterate our clear and credible call for fairness and ambition for wales that mean fair funding deal so that we can properly invest in our public service it mean the billion owe to we from so that we can connect our community north to south and it mean power over our natural resource so that we can ensure energy profit be direct into welsh community help we to build an economy fit for the future and create well pay green job of course we face the immediate challenge to the economy in wales of the situation of port talbot think everybody in this house will be very much aware that we need security of supply when it come to virgin steel for all the other project that we hope to bring forward with net zero the uk government need to be work closely on find some solution to what be happen in port talbot this be an important point when we talk about fairness it be not matter of beg for money from westminster on the one hand it be about demand the money that be rightly owe to wales people who argue for the strength of the union possibly from the government benches it be not something that my party do should be look for that give the nation of wales fair funding however it be equally significant to and my party that we have the necessary lever the tool that we need to drive up our own economic development in wales we do not want to have our hand out with begging bowl we want the mean to grow our own economy and for that to be answerable in wales interestingly that point be raise in the king speech today in relation to devolution in england have have quarter of century of devolution in wales under the model devise by labour and under labour government it would be very interesting to strengthen the economy in wales as well plaid cymru amendment set out that vision in plain term it call for measure to reform wales fiscal framework to provide consistency transparency and fairness replace the barnett formula with needs base formula introduce multi year funding settlement and restore the welsh budget to spending review level that be how labour could bring about real change in wales indeed what be miss from this king speech be just as important as what be in it the decision not to scrap the two child benefit cap show labour choice not to prioritise the immediate need of nearly third of child in wales who live in poverty labour official have repeatedly refuse to make that so call unfunded commitment but the point this matter be that the decision not to fund that commitment be political decision plaid cymru have champion real change alternative mean of taxation that would enable the funding of progressive policy such as equalise capital gain tax with income tax which would raise billion year some billion be need to fund the abolishment of the two child benefit cap less than fifth of all that potential income just imagine how much we could do with the remain contribution to the public purse scrap that cap alone would help lift affected child out of poverty in wales that be of child in wales child poverty level be unacceptably high and this policy only increase those level far invest in our child future would be real powerful change in the here and now labour have commit to the idea of taskforce and have to welcome that because it be step in the right direction it be very interesting that that have happen today be this the first indication of turn on the part of labour if so would welcome it and look forward to hear more on that today labour also commit to strengthen devolution in england it be of course important that community have real say in decision that affect they yet similar promise be not make to wales labour manifesto commit to strengthen the sewel convention and to weasel word the devolution of justice and police to wales that have already be consider because it be the policy of the labour party in wales but it have not be bring forward give the state of our prison as bequeath to we by the previous government with their policy of year of austerity we need radical idea to tackle that blight and the question of how we rehabilitate people and deal with justice in wales of course the key measure involve with rehabilitation and make our community safe namely health and housing be already in the hand of the senedd we need all this in place in recent year welsh devolution have be constantly undermine it be high time to go far and pass legislation to put legal safeguard in place to protect devolved power we also need to heed the recommendation of expert and expand devolved power particularly in policing and justice but in broadcasting too if we be to tackle the question of the expansion of far right populism we need to have the mean to do so through broadcasting we also need to expand devolve power in rail service and the crown estate to name just some plaid cymru will use the clear role that we have in this new parliament to demand that wales be treat fairly we will of course also be raise with colleague in this place the question of our relationship with our near neighbour when be stand in pen llŷn the near capital city be not london but dublin and our relationship with the rest of the eu be absolutely critical since the economic damage that brexit cause we will also be raise the issue of the disaster that be unfold in gaza and the response of this place and how we seek justice for the people of palestine and make sure that in future they be properly treat and recognise as nation in the world again we will be use this theatre to make sure that our voice be hear we will therefore continue to push the uk labour government to be more ambitious hear the prime minister talk about the lobby of good intention yes there be good intention there be also good intention to work together where we can and plaid cymru will hold this place to account for the people of wales it be always pleasure to speak in this chamber have have the pleasure of do so for the past year but it be not half big improvement to be stand on the government side of the chamber look forward to give full support to this new labour government in their endeavour as they take their first step in change our country for the well congratulate my hon friend the members for bolton north east kirith entwistle and for wolverhampton west warinder juss who give outstanding maiden speech they have set the bar rather high for the rest of my hon friend as think they would all agree but wish they all well in their endeavour indeed congratulate all new and return member we have an inheritance after year and would just say to some of the conservative members who have defend the previous government record or at least have attempt to do so as they have make their various leadership pitch that the economic performance of those year tell rather different story with low living standard cost of live crisis and low growth in fact growth have be so low that have we maintain the growth of the last labour government gdp would be billion high every household would on average have more every single year and there would be billion more on the same tax rate for spending and investing in our public service and our infrastructure that be what year of conservative government have mean for this country and to cap it all we have the liz truss and kwasi kwarteng exuberance of the mini budget with the disastrous crashing of the economy which have leave people pay high interest rate even now two year later that be the record we inherit it be what we have to fix and we have make very good start in the gracious speech the importance of economic stability be underline with the announcement of budget responsibility bill to deliver stability and to attract investment by create confidence throughout the economy there be the national wealth fund to attract private investment and to invest in the massive opportunity available to we in this country which almost uniquely in western europe be through clean energy with our geographical and geological opportunity as well as our marvellous tech in this country our science base and our university there be the reform to plan to deliver infrastructure and housing and the reform to skill to deliver for our worker and for their employer the investment we have announce in transport which be so important the improvement in rail and in bus and the commitment to sustainable aviation fuel show that this be government who actually understand the importance of integrated transport in deliver societal and economic improvement turn to the impact on my constituency we like everybody in this house will benefit from the commitment to take action on nhs and dental waiting list and to improve appointment as well as to recruit additional teacher and to bring in breakfast club place for our child all of those will make massive immediate difference and they be part of the down payment that the prime minister commit to during the election campaign and reiterate in his brilliant speech early in my constituency one piece of legislation announce today above all be of particular significance represent many people whose love one die at hillsborough or who be injure or who attend so be very pleased along with all of my merseyside and liverpool city region colleague and indeed many more in this house for everyone who have campaign so hard for justice for year the legal duty of candour on all public official and authority will now be create as it should have be so many year ago be thrill at the announcement about and the commitment to mental health in the gracious speech maghull health park in my constituency arguably have the most comprehensive array of mental health service in europe with medium and low secure provision to go with the well know high secure ashworth hospital which be the good arrangement on single location mersey care nhs foundation trust along with the liverpool city region combine authority and sefton council all want to see as do investment in world lead diagnostic and research mental health facility on the same site what we hear in the gracious speech give great confidence that such investment be likely to be available so that we can make the most of what we be already very good at in this country and make so much more of it it must be right as the sovereign say in the other place that mental health should have the same attention as physical health this bring on to speak in more detail about energy the liverpool city region and the north west of england be supremely well place to be at the heart of the government plan for investment in clean energy and energy security contrary to what some conservative members have be say this be about job cheap transport and low energy bill it be an economic investment as much as it be an environmental one it be of course essential that we support worker in the oil and gas industry so that we avoid the mistake of deindustrialisation and that there be job and training for people to make the transition and take advantage of the low carbon future that we all know be come in the liverpool city region and across the country it be absolutely right that we make the most of opportunity in fix and float offshore wind be so pleased that one of the secretary of state first act have be to end the ban on onshore wind and indeed that he have announce three new solar farm in the north west and elsewhere there be plan for hydrogen for carbon capture and storage and for nuclear and uniquely in the north west in the city region we have great plan for the mersey tidal project they be all key to growth to prosperity and to address the climate crisis so be thrilled that this be front and centre of labour plan for government there be many other aspect of the low carbon future include improvement in insulation in housing and plan for solar for people at home that be something have invest in and have see the benefit with low bill already would advocate that for everybody and it be brilliant that we be commit to give everybody the ability to make the most of such an opportunity the liverpool city region and the north west be part of the hynet project which be commitment to series of green hydrogen generation unit we be also commit to improvement in green transport through the roll out of ev charging point something that have to happen much more quickly right across the country and there be already net zero hydrogen bus in service in the city region elsewhere in the city region glass futures be lead the way internationally in decarbonise the production of glass and we be also look at battery storage whether in the city region or elsewhere in the country this really be key not just to labour energy mission but to the mission of sustain the high growth in the and whether through investment in energy or improvement in public service by have growth at the centre we really will see improvement in this country and we really will see change from what we have see over the past year the year of chaos be over and it be time to turn the page as the prime minister say it be time to work together and he offer to do so with all member in this house and people beyond this house to start to rebuild britain today gracious speech be an important down payment in secure britain future call sir roger gale thank you mr deputy speaker would like to start by add my congratulation to both the hon member for bootle peter dowd and for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi on their speech early this afternoon suspect that you and have hear quite number of such speech and think we can probably agree that those be two of the very good we have ever hear may also congratulate the hon member for wolverhampton west warinder juss who speak movingly of his football team and of his town in which he quite clearly have great pride have not visit wolverhampton for over year and do not know whether the ambassador bowling alley be still there but recall that berry gordy bring the motortown revue to wolverhampton and actually watch stevie wonder play ten pin bowl in the wolverhampton bowling alley think about that it be year since be first elect to this house as the then young member of parliament for the new seat of north thanet and be delighted that year later find myself elect as the young member of parliament for herne bay and sandwich new colleague on both side of the house who have not hear these type of speech before you and both know this very well indeed mr deputy speaker will find that they will make great friendship right across the house over the come week and month and that be as it should be out there in the real world people do not understand that we work so closely together but we do and so we should jo cox be absolutely right when she memorably say that there be much more that unite we than divide we and so it be with this speech today should also place on record my thank and hope the thank of the whole house to the leader of the opposition and the prime minister for the way in which they have manage with great dignity the transfer of power this country do state opening rather well and it do democracy even well there be many who envy we for that and it be precious jewel that we should never lose this king speech have much in it that trust we can all applaud it make clear reference to defence of the realm which be so vital to our country and commitment to nato it also commit we to support ukraine in what be not just their war but our war war to defend democracy there be also commitment although not everybody will agree with this to two state settlement in the middle east those be all laudable aim and trust we can all support they there be other area that be greyer and that we shall have to take some issue with that be the job of the opposition as the prime minister would expect the opposition will hold his foot to the fire and hold he to account when we think that he have get it wrong there be three issue that want to raise very briefly this afternoon have grave concern about the propose reform of planning law like many government members represent rural constituency and fear for the loss of farmland be not sure this be genuine confusion and concern whether it be the chancellor of the exchequer or the secretary of state for housing who be drive the propose planning reform policy have very real concern that local democracy will be remove and that we shall find ourselves with slash and burn policy that will destroy yet more of not only the green belt but of the land we need to grow the food to feed our country trust that the government will address that issue very clearly and very seriously indeed the new secretary of state for energy security and net zero have move very fast indeed to grant planning consent that give cause for concern find it wholly unnecessary that east anglia and thanet should have to place solar farm on prime agricultural land grade land that generate wheat of bread make quality we have acre of rooftop and car park in public ownership that could and should be use to protect the land that we need have particular concern about project that two colleague from east anglia refer to early the sea link project be design to run power cable from east anglia under the thames and around the coast to make landfall close to sandwich the proposal be to build on marshland immediately next to site of special scientific interest have cross the pegwell bay nature reserve foot high structure the size of about four football pitch national grid have get this so horribly wrong that it only now realise that marshland be wet which mean it will have to pour thousand of tonne of concrete into the land drill down and pile before it can even begin to build its structure viable alternative have be suggest so hope that the new secretary of state will take this concern on board and use his power to instruct national grid to go back to the drawing board and get it right we all want clean energy and renewable energy and we all want to hit the net zero target but not at any price if we rush into this we will get it wrong we owe it to the grandchild of every member present to get it right finally be concern about an omission from the king speech give the comment and publicity be sad that the speech make no mention of animal welfare would hope that at the very least his majesty new government will reintroduce and ram through the trophy hunting bill that two member of parliament one labour and one tory try but fail to get through the last parliament with that in the interest of this united kingdom wish the government and their programme well we will hold foot to the fire where necessary but trust as the leader of the opposition say this afternoon that we will not be obstructive government have right to get their business through call patrick hurley to make his maiden speech thank you mr deputy speaker for call to make my first speech as part of this important debate first may thank the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale for his contribution may also pay tribute to all those who be make their first speech today wish they well today and for the remainder of this parliament and hope that we each manage to repay the trust that our new constituent have place in we be lead to believe that certain convention apply to member first speech wish to assure the house that will abide by those convention accordingly wish to pay sincere tribute to my predecessor damien moore who diligently serve southport for the past seven year pave the way for new government to ensure that the town good day lie ahead wish he nothing but the good for the future also wish to refer to another of my predecessor as the mp for southport somebody already mention in today debate at the general election william gladstone be elect as one of the three members for the south lancashire county constituency which take in both southport and my original hometown of prescot as be sure member will appreciate this fact help somewhat over the past month or so in draw link between where be bear and where now represent in this house expect that be not alone among new member in have be rather overwhelmed over the past couple of week by the mountain of email correspondence that we have receive from constituent and other since be elect can though take some comfort in the fact that my inbox refer solely to the much small constituency of southport rather than to the whole of the south lancashire constituency that william gladstone represent can only imagine the additional stress and strain on member in gladstone day if they too have have access to parliamentary email address as well as be part of the same old county constituency both prescot and southport be also within the boundary of the old hundred of west derby this fact be bring far to my attention when the boundary commission announce during the last parliament that the new southport constituency would from now onwards also contain tarleton and hesketh bank two beautiful village on the south coast of the ribble as result of this change research at my local library whereabout the boundary of the west derby hundred be hop that would be able to say that tarleton and hesketh bank have many year ago also be under the same county division as southport alas this be not to be after quite some hour of research realise that the information be look for have actually be star in the face all along it appear that the boundary between the hundred of west derby and leyland lie along would you lane and that boundary lane be situate in hamlet call hundred end it be lesson think in not ignore the obvious when it be right there in front of you my predecessor in previous parliaments have talk about how they have feel that southport have sometimes be take for grant or take advantage of and so have subsequently seek to discuss and elevate division between the town of the local borough wish to assure my constituent that will take different approach instead will work to ensure that our country new government will not look to cause division with our neighbour whether they be other country thousand of mile away or even other town just few thousand yard away instead will work with colleague to ensure that the government will look to unite our country in the task of national renewal because the politic that believe in be politic of the common good politic where each of we look out for the wellbeing of the other rather than try to do other down many town and village in this country have see well day than over the past few year southport be no different whereas other area have have for instance much need housing not build or much need transport link not implement two issue that be pleased to see the new government be plan to address southport problem have manifest themselves in the temporary closure of the town much love pier and in the town centre whose main street need more than their fair share of love and attention promise to work with colleague in this house and beyond to fix these issue the new government priority on economic growth be entirely the right approach unless we get the trend rate of growth back to level our task in this parliament of reduce poverty will be much hard the government have my full support in their approach wish it to be know that will do my utmost to make sure that southport good day lie ahead of it that the decline of recent year will be arrest and that the town fortune will be turn around and that will work with good people of good faith to bring that about no matter what their party affiliation with that would like to thank you mr deputy speaker for allow the opportunity to make my first speech in this place thank the house for the manner in which the speech be receive rise order we still have member who wish to speak so after the next speaker sir julian lewis be afraid must impose time limit of seven minute this strict time limit will not apply to maiden speech but be sure that those who make they will also want to keep an eye on the clock and remember the courtesy of the house if we do not impose this time limit now and if people do not keep to it not everybody will get to speak in this debate who would have ever dream sir edward when we first meet in october that so many year later both you and your equally radical and progressive friend my constituency neighbour and hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope would successively grace this house by occupy the speaker chair wish to make congratulation theme of my short contribution want to congratulate in particular the three maiden speaker we have hear so far it take quite bit of do to make one maiden speech so soon after enter the house of commons and it be greatly to their credit that they make such generous tribute to their predecessor the hon member for bolton north east kirith entwistle talk about work across party boundary which wish to come back to the hon member for wolverhampton west warinder juss concentrate on housing issue and the great sport record and legacy of his beloved wolverhampton too can remember billy wright from all those year ago the hon member for southport patrick hurley who have just speak show an intimate knowledge of the local issue affect his new seat and be sure he will be extremely assiduous in attend to they say that believe congratulation be theme that be in order and wish to echo what my right hon friend the member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale say about the result of the election and the way in which power be transfer it go without say that whenever we have general election and one side achieve significant absolute majority as have happen in this case there will be majority of people in the chamber who feel self congratulatory but suggest that we all ought to congratulate ourselves and each other on the way in which we have handle the transfer of power it be cause for great concern that when we look among modern democracy both in western europe and sadly across the atlantic we see that the cause of democracy in those country be currently so ragged and threadbare let we hope it be but pass phase to those situate on the opposition benches have to say that bad though the result be for the conservative party those who observe these benches today should not think it be quite as much of wipeout as it might appear think that two of we at least have have the experience of sit on these benches before be one of first time conservative mp elect in the blair landslide of have year on the opposition benches and then after that have five year in coalition which be the bad be not sure but offer piece of advice to all new entrant to the house include on the government benches if you want to enjoy your time in this place ask yourself the follow question and hopefully give yourself the right answer would you still want to be here if you know that you be go to be back bencher for all of your parliamentary career if the answer be yes you be in the right place cle to it because then anything else that happen be bonus if the answer be no you make the wrong career decision get out at the next possible opportunity because you will never be satisfied people who come in with that attitude be disappoint they may make it to the front bench but not make it to be cabinet minister they may make it to the cabinet but not get to be one of the top four or they may make it to the top four but not get the top job we know what happen even to many prime ministers who get right to the top so enjoy the status that you have get bank it and look on everything else as dividend turn to the king speech on which will make just couple of observation because we do not have the time for anything more detailed on planning presumption be always little bit worried about presumption in favour of this and presumption in favour of that let we hope that be not shorthand for ignore what people want in my constituency of new forest east the big local issue for the first six year of my time in this place be proposal to build giant container port on reclaimed land on southampton water call dibden bay associated british ports say that without do that the port of southampton would begin to die we fight that for six year and we win guess what the port of southampton do not die it find other way of deal with the container traffic which have thrive now we have the prospect of freeport in the area like to think that the new people in charge of associated british ports will be lot more sensitive about what they plan for the delicate part of the constituency all would say be do not trample roughshod over community concern about major infrastructure project because sometimes that may not get we the good project on conversion therapy just leave question hang in the air anybody who vote for this change need to be able to answer this point what be it that you be propose to outlaw that be not already forbid under exist law the danger with well intentione law of this nature be that we can end up really talk about thought crime seventy five year after george orwell nineteen eighty four be publish technically speak perhaps it be now year we need to be wary of that have constituent with whom happen to disagree about abortion he be totally oppose to abortion be not and do not think that there should be demonstration outside abortion clinic he want to be able to stand silently by himself on the pavement and pray internally if he be ask by the police what he be do and he say be think about my shopping some other domestic issue he be fine but if he admit that he be pray in relation to the abortion issue he could end up be accuse of commit an offence we should be careful before go down that road too far when it come to modernise the membership of the house of lords we must be careful about blanket proposal well inform group lead by professor lord norton of louth have be grapple with sensible way of try to modernise and reform the house of lords for quite number of year such voice need to be listen to the house of lords though some people be appoint to it on the wrong basis do an important job if may please have few more moment have one last point which be significant and relate to the intelligence and security committee this be an essential matter that will need to be incorporate into one of the piece of legislation that the government be to introduce single amendment to the justice and security act be require to protect particular aspect of our parliamentary democracy that be currently be undermine the amendment would establish an independent office to support the intelligence and security committee of parliament which chair until recently in order to safeguard the committee independence for the benefit of the new member of the house the isc be cross party and cross house committee create by statute under the justice and security act the isc have the legal responsibility for oversee the uk intelligence community on behalf of parliament new members will be surprised to hear that the isc office very small number of staff belong to the cabinet office when the isc oversee large part of the cabinet office they would be right to be surprised that be fundamental conflict of interest that be why at the time of the justice and security act the cabinet office be suppose to be only temporary home but in the more than year that have elapse since then the committee office be still beholden to vulnerable within and unfairly pressurise by the very part of the executive that it be charge with oversee the executive should not be able to constrain and control the committee democratic oversight on behalf of parliament by exert control over the committee small team to the extent that the cabinet office official be actually override the committee as have happen repeatedly in respect of staff assessment in recent year or starve it of resource so that it be unable to fulfil its legal responsibility the member of the isc in the last parliament therefore determine unanimously across all party and both houses represent by its membership that it be essential for parliamentary democracy that the committee office move out from under the control of the executive and be establish instead as an independent body corporate with link to parliament rather than the executive in the king speech this be my final point we hear this morning programme outline that give an obvious vehicle for put this matter right the commonwealth parliamentary association and international committee of the red cross status bill which be design to change the status of those two organisation that be therefore the obvious place to include short amendment to the legislation necessary to change the status of the committee organisation as well hope that we can work across party boundary to ensure that the resource and the independence of the staff of the intelligence and security committee can now be secure after difficult time in which the excellent staff have help to

pleased that our new labour prime minister set out so clearly that this government be here to serve the country and not be self centre or self serve we in this house be public servant we should do all we can to ensure that we represent the people who vote for we and those who do not to ensure their voice be hear in this place of power we must work to ensure the good outcome for all of they the king

of the uk as former trade union officer be so glad to see that the new deal for work people will be bring forward to ban exploitative practice and to enhance employment right we need to end the terrible practice of fire and rehire quickly and the use of zero hour contract it be so important that people be pay fairly and that work be reward but we also need safety net for those who be not able to work and need support sometimes for short time while other need long term support legislation to reform rail franchising will be most welcome especially by people like who travel on the train on weekly basis we need to ensure that there be fair investment across the rail network and that passenger get fair deal on ticket and get to their destination in comfort and on time look forward to the establishment of great british railways in due course be also look forward to the introduction of great british energy publicly own clean power company which will be base in scotland have to say gently to the government that be sure we could have have it base in wales but will leave that debate for another day also welcome the measure to strengthen community policing deal more effectively with antisocial behaviour and improve victim support have work with number of woman in my constituency who have suffer domestic abuse for many many year want to ensure the police learn from their story and that any potential victim in the future have their issue address and their life make safe as quickly as possible be also pleased to see include bill to progressively increase the age at which people can buy cigarette and most importantly to impose limit on the sale and marketing of vape as former physiotherapist like my hon friend the member for york central rachael maskell be extremely concerned that people across the uk be still die from cigarette relate condition have treat patient who have irreversible change to their lung and other condition directly due to smoking the evidence of the link between nicotine and poor health and premature death have be very clear for many year now but we also know that the longitudinal evidence on vaping have not yet be undertake fully we need to be cautious about the use of vape in particular the easy way that child and young people be able to obtain they the addictive nature of vape be well known have speak to local school teacher who find that pupil be have to leave lesson or even exam to vape that be so disruptive to the individual pupil and the whole class it would be good to ensure safety and limit access to vape that legislation can not come soon enough must also mention the plan to reform the house of lords as my predecessor paul flynn spend many year call for that he would be delighted to hear this news and would immediately start ask when he would be gratify to hear that the abolition of hereditary peer will be achieve within the first term of this parliament look forward to learn more about these constitutional reform and how the other place will continue to scrutinise the work of this chamber because that be very important its role have be so vital in recent month and year as we witness in the last parliament it would be remiss of not to mention some area that be not mention in the king speech the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale and many member of this house be very well aware of the importance of animal welfare have hundred of email on this vital topic every month must admit be disappoint not to read of any animal welfare legislation such as the banning of hunt trophy or puppy smuggling the introduction of keep animal bill and the tightening up of the rule around trail hunting in the king speech gently ask my front bench colleague to ensure that these important piece of legislation be bring forward in this parliament be happy to be reassure that not everything make the final cut in the king speech you can rely on mr deputy speaker to speak out on animal welfare because animal can not there be so many other aspect of the king speech that would like to commend but be very conscious of other want to speak support the plan legislation and urge my front bench colleague to begin their work straight away to bring hope to people across the uk and to make this country place fit for the century safe and prosperous and where people be proud to live and raise their family it be great pleasure to be able to take part in this debate congratulate the new member on their maiden speech put on record my deep thank to all the people of the islington north constituency for vote for in the election to be an independent mp fight as an independent be an interesting experience after fight election as labour candidate it be very different experience you have to have deep and very honest conversation with everybody on every doorstep as to why you be do it be grateful to the people for their response and for their confidence in to be their member of parliament put on record my thank to they this election show an enormous parliamentary majority for the labour party congratulate all labour mp who have be elect and congratulate the government on take office but think people should be little bit careful the total vote for labour be low in this election than it be in the last two general election number of independent like be elect and there be an increase in green mps an increase in plaid cymru mp and an increase in sinn féin mps from northern ireland there be level of discontent in our society that be reflect in the election result we ought to reflect on that people in this election be totally feed up with fall living standard increase level of poverty increase level of homelessness and high level of mental health stress and deep unease among many people in all our community as the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell say early if the government do not deliver on improve living standard for the very poor in our society and deliver on improve the public service that everybody rely on then the alternative be turn towards the far right in politic who will simply blame migrant refugee or any handy minority for the problem that people face we need something concrete that set out strong message about how we will improve living standard and make for fairer society good start would be end the two child benefit cap immediately it would cost billion take child out of poverty instantly and be signal that we be serious the idea of commission to look at poverty be no doubt very welcome be sure sir humphrey think that one up very fast quick folk there be problem lot of mp be complain about the two child cap let we set up commission and just delay this but why not do it now why not say quite simply we be go to end the cap it be cruel and nasty to suggest that the third fourth or fifth child in family be less valuable than the first two hope the government will listen to that and hope that if there be vote next week substantial number will vote in exactly the same way as members vote in when the incoming government decide to cut the lone parent benefit and be forever mark by that decision why not make this decision now my constituency like many other suffer from serious housing problem level of homelessness be increase all the time with not just rough sleeping but overcrowding and the private rent sector be completely unaffordable be interested by the section of the king speech about regulation of the sector everything in that be fine and agree with it all but there be something missing there be no reference to control rent level that be the fundamental problem yes we want security of tenure and yes we want decent condition but if the private rented sector be not regulate inner city community such as mine will simply suffer further migration as people be price out of the area we need comprehensive housing strategy that regulate the private rent sector bring the housing association under control because in my experience they be not democratic in any way and above all ensure that resource be available for the building of council housing which be the most secure permanent form of housing that we can provide that would help to reduce the level of housing stress there be currently million people on the social housing register want to make two more point in the short time that be available the thatcher government from onwards be beyond obsess with the privatisation of public service whenever they be oppose on that be in the chamber throughout that time and be happy to say that vote against every single one of the privatisation they say it be fine regulation will take care of it well we have have more than year of regulation of the water industry and during that time billion have be take out of water company in either profit or dividend rather than be spend on investment in infrastructure we now have record high bill demand for even high bill from the water company and unprecedented level of sewage disposal in our river and also in the sea which be contrary to the global oceans treaty that we apparently support surely it be pretty obvious that the privatisation have fail let we bring the industry back into public ownership and ensure that we have reasonably price clean water and investment rather than profit taking my last point concern global issue will say this very quickly because have only minute leave the war in gaza have already cost life and surely now be the time to do number of thing first we should demand ceasefire with all the vigour we can bring to that secondly we should end the supply of arm to israel it be our bomb in part that be be use to bomb gaza and have take the life of people however it be also question of the withdrawal of the occupy force surely peace can come if we do something about it hope that the defence review come up will be not just about increase defence expenditure but will look at the global situation and see what we can do to promote peaceful sustainable world and defend human right and democracy in the world in the last parliament be member of the council of europe and enjoy defend the principle of the european convention on human right and the universal declaration of human right we can make contribution for peaceful sustainable world if we want to it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn may congratulate all member who have be return to the house of commons and in particularly congratulate and welcome all the new member wish they every success and happiness in their time in the house the humble address be introduce by my hon friend the member for bootle peter dowd great friend of mine and second by my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi they be both warm kind people probably the two kind know in the house and their speech be very warm very humorous and very interesting that be the highlight of the day in my view must thank in particular my constituent in st helens south and whiston for return once again it be great honour to represent the town in which be bear and in which hope to die and to represent those great people who have work so hard during their life for too long social care and the need of elderly and vulnerable patient have not be adequately consider but social care be just as important as our national health service indeed the nhs have suffer greatly from the lack of appropriate and necessary recognition and consideration of social care within government we have hear time and again about record waiting list patient be treat in hospital corridor and ambulance carry patient have to queue for hour outside accord to communication from the north west ambulance service odd ambulance have be stick in whiston hospital car park the hospital have already turn corridor into ward and be do everything it could but the ambulance be still stick in the car park this be simply because hospital be over capacity and whiston have be well over capacity on many occasion it be very popular and very good hospital but it be overstretch elderly and chronically sick people be not be give the dignity that they deserve at time unsafe discharge have occur in various hospital and that need to change there be new term now it be not bed block but accommodation not clinically need social care must be fix and properly finance and it must be truly affordable for people to use the pressure that the nhs be under will only be fix if social care be fix as well because of the wonder of modern medicine people be live long but that often bring with it multiple complex need our care system have not keep up with these change family care and they also need support care staff can not leave sick person alone wait for an ambulance often they wait for hour which have knock on effect on shift pattern and ultimately on other patient who be wait for the care and support that they need elderly and vulnerable patient should not be leave wait for food medicine and personal care the nhs and the care sector need to be well integrate in order to stop situation like that arise care home and nursing home be also close so again there be lack of capacity lead to unsafe discharge the sector be in crisis and patient be suffer when it come to adult social care reform priority must be give to treat patient at home where they feel comfortable with their family around they and with their neighbour pop in that be essential both to protect hospital bed capacity and to give elderly and disabled people the dignity they deserve and the ability to stay in the home they love in familiar surrounding most of the care and even some of the medical and clinical treatment can be give at home have witness this and that can free up nhs bed capacity for those who need the bed to receive treatment that they can not receive at home the current system of rely on local authority whose budget have be cut for more than decade be not good enough even with the additional social care levy local authority be struggle to cope the levy be base on council tax level so the area with the low return will receive pittance it be in those area that more people need care and support accord to the local government association of council tax already go on social care it be not sustainable because there be less and less money and more and more people we live long now and we will continue to live long in the long term so the problem will only continue to get bad social care should be finance nationally and it should follow the need of patient we can not give quota of money when there be hundred of people in one borough and perhaps in another borough need support it need to follow the need of the patient one of the sector major problem be hire and retain care worker who do an incredibly difficult job they be absolute angel who look after our elderly relative and love one with love and compassion social care should be promote as value service and professional in the sector deserve recognition and respect yet the pay and term and condition need to match the duty we ask of they the whole sector need rework to ensure that it pay fairly and offer progression so that staff can afford to stay in the job that they love and want to do they should be value labour have promise rightly to set up national care service thereby finally put care on par with the nhs because it need to be modern healthcare system there need to be sector of social and healthcare profession the reform need to look at the funding model at home treatment staffing issue and crucially the integration with the nhs first of all may correct something the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn say there have not be an increase in sinn féin representation follow the election though people might be forgive for think so give the way the bbc report on the election in northern ireland secondly may congratulate the government on their success in the election like other we wish they every success because successful government mean successful country thirdly may say to all those who have make their maiden speech today that it be very nervous experience can remember my maiden speech my party leader at the time ian paisley take aside and say sammy there be three thing you ve get to do first of all you ve get to speak nicely about your constituency over the year have listen to people speak about their constituency in their maiden speech and have always think that they would make great estate agent secondly he say say nice thing about your predecessor despite the fact that have spend year knock on door talk to people address meeting and give out leaflet to tell people why they should not vote for he lastly he say sammy do be controversial come from ian paisley that advice really cap it all will say two thing about the king speech in the time available to first be pleased that the government be look at how they can strengthen the union and for way to foster collaboration between the devolved administration because sometimes devolve administration can be very divisive for the coherence of the country they claim all the benefit and take credit for all the good thing that happen and they blame westminster for all the bad thing which can cause division as unionist be pleased to see that through the propose council of the nation and region we will hopefully get great degree of collaboration communication and understanding between different part of the union however have to say that this issue can not be address unless the government seriously look at the damage do to the union by the previous administration which make northern ireland sacrificial lamb in order to get deal with the eu leave we with the economic and constitutional disadvantage and division that that have cause those be manifest on daily basis and the eu seem determined not to address they whether it be veterinary medicine which will wreck the farming industry the recent dental amalgam which will make dental treatment more expensive and very difficult in northern ireland the late controversy about funding for the shipyard and whether it contravene state aid rule or the disruption of supply chain which be an issue that have to be address we can not have an economic division between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom and government who profess that they want to strengthen the union can not ignore that elephant in the room many of the new member who have be elect come here because they want to have an influence on the law that govern the united kingdom there be area of law in northern ireland that be determine not by this parliament or by the people elect in northern ireland but in europe without any input from anyone in the united kingdom that be not democracy and it have to be address the second issue will mention be the government commitment to economic growth in any country economic growth depend upon cheap energy and be fearful that some of the policy that have already be implement and the promise make in the king speech will make it difficult to achieve economic growth in the previous parliament we lament almost on monthly basis the loss of energy intensive industry it do not matter whether it be port talbot corby or grangemouth representative from all over the united kingdom see the impact on their local community with thousand of job be lose because of energy policy and the cost of implement net zero if we be aim for economic growth we can not allow the obsession with net zero to stand in the way of job in this country notice that in the commitment to net zero in the king speech we be tell that we will get low energy bill over time initially of course we will have high energy bill we want to remove the infrastructure that we have in place and put totally new infrastructure in place windmill new line and all the other infrastructure that be require to bring energy from place where we do not currently produce it to where we need it we need to strengthen the grid because we be go to use more electricity all of that cost and it will put up consumer bill at the same time of course we will make ourselves more dependent on the country that supply all the vital metal require for that we do not even gain any environmental benefit the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale talk about the impact on his community in my constituency see the antrim hill be strip of peat metre deep to build wind farm that be suppose to be environmental improvement look forward over the period of this government to examine just what they do on this issue we need to make sure that we do not have contradictory policy whereby we aim for net zero but dip our hand into people pocket to pay for it this be the first time have ever be able to speak from the government side of the house have first be elect in which be six prime ministers ago in the general election bermondsey and old southwark be so far down labour target list it be no think that the rule of thumb be that if win we would be in government will not ask where everyone else have be for the last nine year but will thank they and congratulate they on be here today especially colleague who have already make their maiden speech and those who will make they in the come week and month it be amazing finally to be on this side of the house but can not say that it have be worth the wait give what the tories have do to our country over the past few year my constituent overwhelming sentiment since the election be one of relief and of shake off the sense of shame and embarrassment about the previous government and the country economic devastation my constituent be still pay high bill and mortgage as result of tory economic incompetence but there be relief that the shame of the last government be over we see the equality and human rights commission have to investigate the department for work and pensions because of its unlawful behaviour towards disabled people through political incompetence and maladministration the second big spending government department be unable to support disabled people properly change in the leadership of that department could not be more refreshing another cause for relief be that the rwanda policy be scrap it be an unlawful immoral international embarrassment that be raise with our foreign office and raise on every trip go on with the foreign affairs committee to the un to the us and to brazil wherever we go country see that we be shirk responsibility while other shoulder great responsibility it be also relief for taxpayer because it be such colossal waste humongous knuckle head nonsense can not even repeat what tory ministers call the scheme when they be in government because it would be unparliamentary language but it cost hundred of million of pound at time when my constituent be be tell that the uplift on universal credit be unaffordable that see doctor or dentist be just not possible and that have enough police be luxury and somehow not government priority all while million be pour down the rwanda drain and for what scheme that send no one but tory home secretaries to rwanda at an outrageous cost for the price of send one person to rwanda you could send six people into space and the electorate give their verdict two week ago when they blast the tories into space and yes terrible pun be on my leaflet in the election the leader of the opposition it feel good to say that say today that he wish to work with the new government on certain policy say to new mps that from opposition be able to improve the law on housing right for woman flee domestic violence on some terminally ill disabled people receive support from the personal independence payment and on support for community affect by terror attack say to they take the prime minister up on his offer he say that the door be open so take he up on that offer to seek improvement that benefit your constituent since the election have have constituent come in to parliament two school have come in st michael college in bermondsey and the southwark inclusive learn service from london bridge it have be amazing to speak to young people about the new priority and how the new government be already begin to mend and heal the uk with the work do in the first week and announce today in the gracious speech this include lift the ban on onshore wind despite green opposition boost uk investment begin to fix our nhs tackle crime and antisocial behaviour and reassert target for house building which be very welcome priority for my constituency in southwark where housing be always the no priority flag to the new government and new ministers that the bakerloo line extension would bring new home at least and benefit not just transport infrastructure and home but job across the country and boost our economy hope to see the bakerloo line extension deliver under the new government offer new hope and new ambition for britain from government who finally say to people not what they can not have but what we be seek to achieve for our country and for our people future include today of particular personal importance to be fix mental health service my mum have schizophrenia mental health condition and that be my route into public policy awareness and politic to have the chance to influence and shape mental health service as we in the labour party begin to fix they and build out well be an enormous privilege want to end today with special thank you to the wonderful people of bermondsey and old southwark for give my fourth win include defeat an independent corbyn candidate to the labour member in my constituency who fight so hard both locally and in other target seat and importantly to my local labour party executive for all their hard work and support in the last parliament in particular and over the election period look forward to deliver the well britain they fight for under this labour government for his maiden speech call graham leadbitter it be an honour to have be elect to represent moray west nairn and strathspey which be something of an amalgam of couple of previous constituency first would like to thank the electorate of the constituency for send to this place to represent they and for put their trust in for the year to come on my arrival here an amazing job have be do by the house staff the independent parliamentary standards authority and other and can not thank they enough for the welcome that they have provide we as new mp have number of predecessor that need to thank not least because mine be nearly two constituency roll into one first of all there be douglas ross who represent moray for the conservatives for several recent year we be not very close on the political spectrum it have to be say but there be number of occasion where we do come together across party for the benefit of the constituency and the wide region notably in the achievement of the growth deal for moray and to maximise the spend that we get on that be sure the official opposition would also want to thank he for his service in the scotland office my predecessor in inverness nairn badenoch and strathspey be drew hendry who be regular contributor from the scottish national party benches he represent we as an opposition spokesperson on the economy trade foreign affair business enterprise and investment and transport over several term as an mp for that area he be also an assiduous campaigner on energy poverty which be particular issue for the highland and island and in moray hope that energy regulation be one of the area that the government commission on poverty will look at very seriously my right hon friend the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn the leader of the snp in this place mention the two child cap will not go into too much detail on that because it have already be well cover but energy poverty be critical issue for many family throughout the highland and moray bring in social tariff for example would certainly make big difference to family right across the highland other predecessor have include several well know parliamentarian labour members will be sure be pleased to know that my constituency be the birthplace of ramsay macdonald and it have also be represent very ably by several notable snp mps over the

pleasure to speak on his majesty first king speech under labour government we promise change and as look around parliament see an awful lot of change with people in new place and so many new face be enjoy start to get to know many of the newly elect member mostly from my party but from other party too to they say welcome and to you and your team mr deputy speaker say good luck learn everybody name and face by coincidence the july general election that put in this place as the first mp for the new spen valley constituency come just three day after the third anniversary of the batley and spen by election in which be first elect to this place it be fair to say that lot have change in just three short year remember pound the street of batley and spen in during challenging time that be full of uncertainty division and for many people fear the dark cloud of the covid pandemic still hang over we many people be struggle with the cost of living and politic feel worryingly polarise in this and other country think it be fair to say that the labour party be not in great place many doubt that we would see power again in year never mind three if the result in batley and spen play its part in turn thing around and get we to where we be today be delighted that we be able to help although be delighted with the result the batley and spen by election be not pleasant experience at time we see the bad of politic include unacceptable behaviour from those who use our precious democracy to divide we rather than unite we my constituent deserve well and hop passionately that no other candidate would have to go through what go through sadly that have not be the case although be relieved that the general election campaign in spen valley be mostly conduct in civilised manner the same can not be say elsewhere many candidate and their supporter often woman face threat harassment and abuse none of this should be part of any job and it be not what our politic should look like we must not normalise it and we must all do our bit to change it on this the first day of the first debate in new parliament we all have the opportunity to reset the dial on politic and work towards political culture that foster robust rigorous debate and scrutiny but do not allow fear intimidation and abuse to become the norm as his majesty say this government will take step to rebuild trust and foster respect wholeheartedly agree with this approach and will work with colleague across the house in this endeavour be realistic optimist know it be not go to be easy to bring the change that our country need but this new parliament fill with hope see people around who be determined to be part of the change to well kind of politic the prime minister rightly describe it as the return of politic to public service and he correctly say that this can be achieve only through action not word with so many new face and so much new energy and commitment believe we have once in generation opportunity in this place to change not only the government although that be certainly welcome but the whole culture of politic to restore the business we be all in to one that people can look at with respect that start with how we behave in here because whether we like it or not this chamber be the window into our national politic if we treat each other in here with courtesy if we listen to the argument of those we disagree with as politely as we listen to the argument of those we support and if we show that we can air our difference passionately but with genuine respect people at home will notice it would be the right thing to do even if they do not but believe they will my constituent want to see change they send here to deliver it and will not let they down it be wonderful part of west yorkshire where people have real sense of pride in where they be from whether that be the town of heckmondwike mirfield birstall or cleckheaton or the many beautiful surround village too many to list but will certainly make sure they all get mention over the next five year understand that pride because share it it be where be bear and have live all my life in spen valley we tell it like it be we be not easily fool and we take no nonsense so my constituent will only believe in change when they see it and when they feel it this king speech set out the busy but exciting agenda to make that change happen and the duty fall on we to make sure it do whether it be affordable housing safe street and more police in our community tackle antisocial behaviour and violence against woman and girl shorter waiting time and well access to gps and dentist on the nhs well education and opportunity for the young academic and vocational include for those with special educational need and disability reliable public transport support for people with mental health or social care that offer dignity in old age and for the most vulnerable in our society be all for give local people more power to make

pay close attention when the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis be advise new member on our ambition for the future particularly because want to share my ambition be the first mp for aberdeenshire north and moray east and hope to be the last mp for aberdeenshire north and moray east this be coastal area that stretch from the river spey in the west to cruden bay in the south it be an area note not only for its industry but for the industriousness of its people and its community its long stand economic strength be in farming fishing and their associated sector include food and drink production and in more recent time in the oil and gas industry and their supply chain the area make substantial and significant contribution to the nation energy security and food security we be now undergo new industrial revolution associate with the renewable sector as the world adapt to new challenge believe that it be our duty in this parliament to capitalise on the opportunity that now present themselves in the north east of scotland it be also most beautiful area something of an undiscovered gem with develop tourism industry member will remember that the next time they enjoy single malt an aberdeen angus steak prawn cocktail or perhaps fish supper because the chance be that they come from the industry base in my constituency there be also significant poverty in particular child poverty in this otherwise prosperous area although this be mainly concentrate in large town it be also challenge in village and rural area where it be often less visible recent figure suggest that around child in this constituency be live in serious poverty some of they in absolute poverty to be clear that mean that they do not have enough money to meet basic need for shelter clothing and food that be something that we should all remember in our position of privilege and it be something that we should all work together on to change want to pay tribute to the outgoing mp david duguid who represent the previous banff and buchan constituency which disappear in the recent boundary change some member will know that david experience sudden and significant ill health before the general election be call wish he speedy and full recovery david be an excellent mp who do his good to represent everybody in the constituency but most notably the interest of the energy fishing and farming industry his effort be in stark contrast to the way that he be treat in the end when he be effectively deselecte by his colleague wish david and his family well in whatever their future plan may involve also wish to acknowledge the work of the last snp mp in this area eilidh whiteford who be an outstanding political representative today in the king speech the government have an opportunity to immediately abolish the harmful two child benefit cap and the notorious rape clause which my former colleague the outgoing mp for glasgow central alison thewliss work so hard to end the failure to do this be an early indictment of the government policy position be encourage when hear contribution from the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier and the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell but what about the contribution from the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn when he say no ifs no but just do it it be simply not good enough for the people of scotland an energy rich nation to pay so much to heat their home while so many of their bairn be live in absolute poverty will be focus on this issue over the course of this parliament will seek to defend the interest of our farming and fishing industry to protect our public service and to help realise the potential of renewable energy and carbon capture to deliver job and economic growth but above all shall be voice for the weak and the disadvantaged after year of austerity we need change of direction not more of the same wish to make special mention of the waspi woman who have be so unfairly treat by successive government and who deserve compensation to conclude thank the people of my constituency for their support at the ballot box my colleague in the snp and in other party and the various member of house staff on the westminster estate who have be so welcoming and helpful on my arrival and during my induction finally and member would not expect to say anything less will be work hard in this place and elsewhere to press the case for the people of scotland to be afford their democratic right to determine their own future it be pleasure to follow the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan after his eloquent and passionate maiden speech huge welcome to all new member it be the great privilege in the world to be here and to be the voice of the place that you love never take that for grant we on the labour benches be under no illusion as to the scale of task ahead of we in government fourteen year of successive conservative government have ravage our public service stifle investment create gross level of inequality and entrench widespread job and housing insecurity so the gracious speech offer welcome national renewal legislation promise to hand power back to local leader support for local growth plan and great protection for renter be welcome and long overdue the new deal for work people be also pivotal step in ensure that the fruit of our economic growth be share by everyone not just select few on child poverty the government have pledge to roll out breakfast club and to develop strategy to reduce child poverty which be very welcome but such extensive plan will take some considerable time to pass through into legislation in the meantime there be immediate measure that the government must take now to alleviate the financial strain face by so many in my constituency indeed on the issue of child poverty alone we be in state of what can only be describe as national crisis research by loughborough university on behalf of the end child poverty coalition report that staggering child in greater manchester and lancashire alone be now live in poverty that be an increase of over compare with the previous year the hope that these family place on the new labour government be immense so my first urgent request of our new labour government be to lift these child out of poverty immediately by scrap the two child limit in universal credit my second urgent request of the government be to settle the debt of honour we owe to woman bear in the who suffer pension injustice the issue now be not whether the woman face injustice the ombudsman report early this year make it clear that they do that the department for work and pensions be guilty of maladministration that the woman be entitle to urgent compensation from the government and that parliament must urgently identify mechanism for provide that appropriate remedy they need fair fast simple redress and an apology from the dwp there be no excuse for delay the report be lay before parliament in march and at least one woman will die wait for justice every minute they deserve nothing less than justice so hope that the government urgently identify mechanism for appropriate remedy now would not normally intervene have just enter the house but know that my friend the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey be speak feel ought to come and hear she and particularly to support the remark she have just make about those woman so badly affect in the way that she have describe it be critical as she say that this matter be address speedily and actually that mean simplify the system that will not please everyone by the way some people want detailed analysis but that be unfortunately likely to lead to obfuscation it be very important as she describe to have simple mechanism which deliver justice to these woman speedily agree wholeheartedly the work that the right hon member and carry out throughout the last parliament be an example of how we can work co operatively with member of opposite party and find those issue on which we can serve our constituent well he join we at an opportune moment as be about to talk about an issue that be close to his heart my final urgent request of the government be one of moral duty to recognise support and compensate our nuclear testing veteran and their family these be the man who put their life at risk in dangerous atomic weapon test to ensure our long term security for decade campaigner labrats veteran and their family and the indefatigable susie boniface have be fight for recognition for these hero they have highlight scientific study that show increase rate of miscarriage increase birth defect and the same rate of genetic damage as clean up worker at chernobyl of course the campaigner take pride in the fact that the defence secretary and the prime minister meet they when labour be in opposition and support their campaign to receive the long overdue recognition they deserve but despite win the campaign for medallic recognition the uk sadly still remain the only nuclear power that refuse they adequate compensation research and support unlike the us france canada and australia medal criterion be very limited there have not be formal recognition event and even access to war pension have be impede veteran and sometimes their wife widow and descendant have report make repeat request to gain access to their blood or urine testing record from sample the veteran recall be take during the nuclear testing programme sadly many confirm that their service medical record frequently do not include the test result and they just do not understand why the data be vital for their war pension application and for understand the condition they suffer but sadly the absence of such record mean that many veteran war pension application be refuse want to place on record my thank to hon member right across the house who have continue to support these veteran particularly the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes who have work closely with and campaigner in recent year this week we have both write to the defence secretary and the minister for veterans and people my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak al carns request that they urgently meet we veteran and campaigner and work with we to deal with their concern we hope that be make an urgent priority because ultimately the government can and should deliver justice for these family and now be the right time to do so last and not least from the opposition benches call jim shannon mr deputy speaker thank you for call and all hon member who have make contribution so far be glad to see you in your place and be glad to be in mine thank the good people of strangford for vote for in the election and wish all member in this house god rich blessing for this term and the year ahead be very pleased to see the labour party and the prime minister in their place believe that all of we across the house and out in the nation we represent wish for thing to go well there be good will and wish to see thing in well way be delighted to hear in the king speech the prime minister goal of take the brake off britain which be goal that every party can get behind yet the unionist in would gently remind the prime minister and the labour party that that responsibility apply equally to the whole united kingdom not simply to mainland britain we need to remove the brake wherever they may be within the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland one brake that spring to mind at this moment be that mention by my right hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson the one hold back harland wolff from provide job and financial stability by not fulfil the contract promise by the last government security on the loan be critical to prevent the removal of economic growth and do hope that brake will be release urgently also welcome the indication that the creation of wealth be to be labour party priority as that be foundational for any nation look forward to work with the labour government to ensure that it be spread across the whole united kingdom of which northern ireland be an integral part there be work to be do when it come to northern ireland place in the union in response to my intervention on the prime minister today he quite clearly commit to ensure that northern ireland position within the united kingdom be strengthen if that be the case it be good news but look forward to see those word become action my colleague and be anxious to continue the work of ensure that our constituent have the same treatment as the rest of the uk from shop to post to import and border control look forward to meet our new secretary of state for northern ireland who be in position to establish that work relationship to the benefit of all within the united kingdom there be work to be do on the remnant of the protocol and know that must be priority for this new government there be also work to be do on establish an adequate formula for funding which both my right hon friend the members for east antrim sammy wilson and for belfast east refer to when be member of the northern ireland affairs committee along with other colleague all party on the committee and the government official be clear that the funding formula be wrong and have to be address we be million to million shy of what other part of the united kingdom be get and there be commitment give to ensure that that would come through my request to the labour government and in particular to the secretary of state for northern ireland will be to ensure that that million gaping hole in northern ireland finance be address with great respect say this we do not need vanity project of casement park at cost of more than million when the very basic of life be be neglect be pleased to hear the aim of improve mental health service which other member have refer to particularly for our young people in northern ireland we have the large prevalence of mental health problem in the whole of the united kingdom my request to the labour government and to my prime minister as he be be to ensure that his mental health programme can work in conjunction with the northern ireland assembly so that we can address mental health issue for our young people head on again there be way of do that if we do it here at westminster and ensure that the northern ireland assembly be work alongside we in that partnership be very keen to ensure that happen also put in plea for peace in the middle east to be an aim of the government would gently highlight that call for ceasefire when hostage remain in unimaginably cruel captivity and without ensure that hamas terrorist can never inflict that kind of savage damage again must surely be premature there be solution and it can be find know that be the desire of all our constituent as well as our friend in israel and on both side of the gaza strip believe that the government must consider maintain the previous government procedural challenge to the international criminal court jurisdiction in israel and in the palestinian territories it be important that the icc retain its proper role within the law and exercise jurisdiction base on its own statute and in accordance with the principle of complementarity as long as have be in parliament there have always be plea from both side of the chamber for the islamic revolutionary guard corps to be condemn and make illegal those plea come from the opposition side when the labour party be in opposition now that labour be in government hope those plea will be answer the irgc be the world most powerful terrorist group commit to the conversion or murder of jews christians zoroastrians and other it consider to be infidel and for year it have pursue its repugnant goal through violence on global scale it be time for it to be proscribe and ask for that to happen as soon as humanly possible be afraid do not have time to go through all the thing want to speak to but will quickly mention the issue of conversion practice just say this gently think the minister responsible have get it there will be consultation beforehand there have to be and there be many of we who have christian faith and belief and who wish to ensure that the belief to which we hold fast be consider fully when it come to make any decision also make plea as have the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey and other for the waspi woman as you probably know mr deputy speaker lead debate on the issue and believe the government need to deliver for the waspi woman have some of they in my constituency and there be in northern ireland we have an obligation to everyone across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to deliver this be new government with new way of do thing and new aim but there be also new opportunity for one will do all can work alongside the government to achieve the aim of make this wonderful united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland wonderful place to live educate our child work and thrive believe that all of we in this house can work together to see that goal realise and people life make well as result after nine year on the opposition benches it be disorientating experience to find myself on the government benches and thing just get little more topsy turvy when find be speak after the hon member for strangford jim shannon do not think that have ever happen before but it give an opportunity to thank he for his friendship and to let new member know that in this house they will find friend in perhaps the most unlikely place thank my hon friend for his friendship and support and know in that speak for many on the government side this be my first opportunity to give substantive speech as the new member for lancaster and wyre as my constituency undergo some significant boundary change at this election will break with convention slightly by pay tribute to the mp have replace in the sense that most of my constituency be represent in the previous parliament by ben wallace he have serve as an mp in lancashire since the general election first for lancaster and wyre and latterly for wyre and preston north ben be the mp elect in the first general election vote in in lancaster and wyre confess that do not vote for the win candidate but his assiduous service should be note especially his service to the country in his role as secretary of state for defence this be also an opportunity to acknowledge the change to our electoral map at the general election the country vote very clearly for change be excited to see much of the content in the king speech particularly when it come to get britain build through planning reform be pleased to hear talk about both infrastructure and housing it be clear to that when we build housing it have to go with infrastructure hear loud and clear from my constituent along the corridor particularly around the garstang area that build new house without infrastructure put more pressure on our public service gp surgery and school place be also pleased to see in the king speech that local leader will be allow to take control of local bus service this week stagecoach which run the bus service in my community have increase the price of the dayrider which have be meet with quite lot of response shall we say from my constituent not only those attend school and college but their parent who be often the one pick up the tab for what be very expensive and often unreliable service as north west mp be serve on the west coast main line by train company call avanti so believe mr deputy speaker bring rail back into public ownership be something my constituent welcome hear loud and clear on the campaign trail that avanti be not fit company to be run so call train service down the west coast of our country right the way from glasgow into london euston it let passenger down on regular basis and think it know its time be up some of my young constituent be run campaign at the moment on sewage dumping we know that ofwat need to have more tooth and more power to regulate the water company know that some of my young constituent will be very pleased to see that part of the king speech turn now to the point about strengthen the integrity of election to encourage wide participation in the democratic process in the last parliament have the privilege of be the spokesperson for the speaker committee on the electoral commission so you will forgive mr deputy speaker if this turn into something of hobby horse of mine be deeply concerned about the state of our democracy and look forward to play full role from the back benches support the government in improve the integrity of our electoral process we can not lose sight of the fact that turnout nationally at general election should concern every one of we in lancaster and wyre it be but take no comfort from the fact that we be marginally high than the national average that be what keep up at night we need to engage people in our democracy because the alternative be unthinkable support the idea of automatic voter registration as my hon friend be aware the levelling up housing and communities committee publish report in the last parliament propose exactly that we go to look at the system in canada which get near to or registration accuracy some million people could not vote in our election because they be not on the electoral register we need to address that pay tribute to my hon friend for the work of his committee in the last parliament and urge the government front benchers to heed that report million of people be miss from our electoral roll if member be concerned about the turnout at the general election they will be even more concerned to note that that figure be probably much low because our electoral roll lack accuracy however that be not all we need to look again at the id requirement during the general election we all come across people who think that they could not vote because they do not have id and be not aware of the voter authority certificate conversation that have in skerton in my constituency stand out to gentleman who have vote in every general election since the say do have id so can vote now he have be totally unaware that the voter authority certificate be an option and it be far too late to apply for one few day from polling day that be replicate up and down the country if we be concern about and want to increase turnout at election we need to fix that personally think that that mean scrap the entire scheme which be always solution to problem that do not exist but add more form of id or include polling card would make it so much easy for people to take part in our democracy have hear lot from constituent who have look at the result of the general election and raise question about proportional representation in the last parliament the government change the voting system for elect police and crime commissioner from the alternative vote to first past the post and they do so in statutory instrument committee do not think that be an appropriate way to go about change our voting system the public should be involve in that conversation the general election result have lead to lot of conversation in lancashire with people who feel that the first past the post system be regressive and that we can find more progressive way of improve our voting system the electoral commission strategy and policy statement make the electorate question the commission independence if we want to build trust and faith in our democracy the public need to believe that the commission be independent and empower to hold political party and candidate to account for our conduct in these thing and that it can take on new challenge include the intimidation of candidate which have already be mention associate myself with the comment of my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater who be no long in her place finally if may will squeeze in an ask of the government on sodium valproate there be many victim of that scandal and they be wait for compensation scheme that should have happen under the last government but the chaos that we have have for the past year mean that it do not hope that those who have campaign long and hard over many year for justice follow that scandal will get it under the labour government recognise that the government have hit the ground run the king speech be full of legislation that look forward to support to bring about the change that the country vote for in respond to the gracious speech will focus on just couple of issue welcome all new

housing scheme across the country begin with focus on liverpool central dock that be positive sign of thing to come solve the housing crisis demand that we be bold over people be on the housing waiting list in liverpool so it be imperative that we push the agenda for social and council housing home for social rent must be front and centre of our plan to give every household every family the dignity of home that they can call their own that would provide long term vision to address the burgeon number of household languish in temporary accommodation which at the last count shamefully include over child ask the ministry of housing communities and local government to work with our council to well regulate the proliferation of house in multiple occupation in concentrated area across our city and town particularly in the north of england where it be place for whole community to be disrupt in my own constituency of liverpool wavertree some street have over of house as hmos with that come environmental issue such as rubbish and noise and it have rip the heart out of community while landlord the majority not from the city make massive profit year after year during the last parliament we hear repeat promise from the previous government to bring in their renters reform bill however the last conservative administration shamelessly cave in to the landlord lobby on their own benches so it fall to this labour government to make it happen the private rented sector have lose all sense of proportion section eviction must be end they pile great pressure on local council and know through my office casework that no fault eviction be worsen the homelessness emergency will be urge my colleague on the front bench to make our renter reform bill as comprehensive package as possible for beleaguered generation of renter who have live the consequence of the cost of live crisis as much as any the report lead by councillor cowan the leader of hammersmith and fulham council should provide the basis of our plan national landlord register to enforce standard rent stabilisation measure and holistic approach that prevent landlord from move to short term holiday let or make

this incredibly important legislation be bring forward by this government after long journey for justice congratulate everyone who make their maiden speech today those speech have be absolutely fantastic and show the calibre of the people who have be elect to this place also welcome back my fellow return mp some with large break than other it be great to see those people back in this place with all their depth of experience we stand at pivotal moment could talk in great depth about all the wonderful bills that be in this king speech from the new deal for work people to the english devolution bill the education bill the child wellbee bill right for renter and the updating of the mental health act which be desperately need but the climate and nature crisis be already impact our life so will focus my remark mainly on that and slightly on transport particularly in the global south but increasingly in the uk we be live through the consequence of climate catastrophe and it be the poor in society who be often suffer the bad of its effect the new agenda for this government be key opportunity to get back on track and prove as we do once previously with the climate change act that the uk can be true climate leader the measure outline in the king speech underscore the government commitment to tackle the climate emergency they be not only word but the green shoot of change end year of conservative lead indifference and even hostility to environmental year that see an effective ban on onshore wind standstill on solar and little to nothing on tidal or green hydrogen while other country around the world have be race ahead to capitalise on the job and wealth that the clean energy transition offer britain have be miss out but today mark new chapter the government plan to make britain green energy superpower achieve clean power by be ambitious and represent clear commitment to reduce carbon emission and embrace renewable energy source it present significant opportunity to stimulate economic growth address the cost of live crisis and make britain energy independent with great british energy own by the british people ensure that family and business benefit from permanently low bill through zero carbon energy system it be right that that will be fund by close loophole in the windfall tax on oil and gas company they have reap enormous profit not because of their innovation or investment but because of the energy shock that have burden family across the country with high price the great british energy bill will end the conservative dash for oil and gas deliver real energy security and put the uk on path to be clean energy superpower with just transition for worker however we also need to look beyond our energy system after year of privatisation britain railway be in crisis with passenger face late overcrowded and cancel service push many commuter on to our road instead for many community the bus be no well in sheffield hallam this be one of the issue raise with in almost all the canvass session do there be often reduction in bus service they be cancel because the bus fleet be not fit for purpose or the route be close and there be no alternative it could not get any bad really and that be why the government passenger railway service bill and well bus bill be vital will be pleased to champion they from the back benches the plan to take train operating company back into public ownership will end decade of conservative chaos develop the infrastructure we need to green our society and make the transition to net zero and give people real alternative to get into their car new power to allow community to take back control of their bus will put decision make back into their hand where it belong not with the private company but with the people the transport system should be serve green our transport and energy infrastructure be central to meet our climate ambition but we can not effectively combat the climate crisis without simultaneously protect our vital ecosystem restore habitat and safeguard our specie the climate crisis have accelerate the nature crisis with the uk now one of the most nature deplete country in the world we must and can do well protect nature must take equal priority to cut emission for too long britain coast river and lake have be pollute by illegal sewage dumping and it be therefore right that this government be commit to place fail water company under special measure withholding bonus from executive who pollute our waterway and bring criminal charge against persistent lawbreaker be very pleased to see that there will be strengthen regulation which be very welcome to many in my constituency who have campaign on this issue also look forward to see plan to empower local government and community through the english devolution bill especially on how they can play their part in tackle both the climate and nature emergency and what local government need to fully tap into the potential of the green economy and green job for our region tackle the climate and nature emergency be not an issue for the future we be already face the effect in the here and now our role be to act immediately to prevent the most damaging effect and welcome the measure set out in this king speech they must be the springboard for wide debate on green our community revitalise our ecology and build greener clean and nature positive economy that work for everyone have one final plea to my front benchers on an unrelated topic which be care for people who have undergo miscarriage campaign

our community be one of the most deprived in the uk unemployment and child poverty be twice the national average too much of our housing be poor quality private rent accommodation the situation be scandalous and worsen and rent be still rise fast than wage those rent must be control tenant must have great protection street be blight by the conversion of home into multi occupancy housing and short term rental and landlord can hike up rent on whim and cast entire family on to the street labour must make security of housing reality for all through council housing social rent and home ownership across liverpool walton our once vibrant high street have too often turn into row of board up store front some of this can be put down to year of tory failure but it feel like we have have decade of decline in local community the reality be that the last year have bequeath great inequality and despair there be economic problem that this labour government can and will put right but the challenge will stretch well beyond that the last year have bring social disintegration and to put it simply unhappiness people be live much more isolated lonely life with rise mental ill health and great drug and alcohol addiction blight our community social media be change how we behave and interact the bad behaviour selfishness and criminality of some which too often go unchecked make the life of other miserable those be the fundamental issue loss of meaning loss of relationship and loss of love those be the social ill that can not be fully express in the cold language of economic indicator they be the product of rotten social and economic model which have erode our sense of social solidarity and fling we into an epidemic of loneliness anger and despair and it real we have end up with an economic and political approach that focus almost entirely on the individual while the family community church and trade union be diminish society be disintegrate leave only the state and the market believe that what be valuable be what we do together in society when people come together that be the treasure that we need to value and nurture we must accept that the government the state can not and should not deliver the solution to all of our problem but it can shape how we live labour in government should limit the bad excess of market greed by that mean the extortion of the working class community represent by corporation and landlord people know when they be be rip off labour in government should limit the most damaging element of the hour global consumer capitalist world that we find ourselves thrust into with little choice to give we back what be really important in our life whether that be time and space for our family our friend and social pursuit dignity at work and dignity at home or space for local trade producer and shop to flourish labour in government must also bring about an end to the unaccountable state with the hillsborough cover up and the windrush post office and contaminate blood scandal the story be always the same liverpool have rich history of trade unionism and working class struggle fierce sense of independence and unique character we know that our community be full of potential wait to be unlocked hope that this labour government will do just that first thank my constituent in sheffield south east for re elect for the ninth time sort of remember make my maiden speech many year ago along with the challenge that pose and the nervousness so pay great credit to all colleague on both side of the house who have do that today so ably and so well be remind by my hon friend the member for sheffield hallam olivia blake who speak early that there be now six labour mp in sheffield be also remind that of those six labour mp be the last man stand that be the change of balance in the house with five woman mp for the city and that be absolutely great we will always continue to work together as colleague on behalf of our city there have be comment about the famous sheffield tea room meeting where we come together once month that be quite famous want to draw particular attention to issue that be raise when be chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee in the last parliament there be so many issue in the king speech that would like to mention but the first be the commitment to build million new home housing have be passion of mine ever since be chair of the housing committee in sheffield back in the clearly we have major problem all mp can refer to people without home in their constituency or who be live with in law in shared accommodation or inadequate home with family live in upper floor flat we need to get britain build again it be good for the home that people need and it be good for growth it be an important part of our growth agenda it be good that we will make local authority set target to be achieve in their local plan not advisory one as the previous government do under the levelling up and regeneration act and it be absolutely right that target have to be meet however if we be to build million home we must recognise that the private sector and private developer will not build they we will not hit that target without substantial contribution from council and housing association that be right in term of the number it be right also to address the housing need of those who can not afford to buy and who need decent home to rent my passion be to get britain building but build social housing as well in try to achieve that it be important to draw attention to particular development in my constituency it right that we build on brownfield site as far as we can the idea that the planning change that the government be propose will somehow mean that central diktat determine where house be build be not the case local plan will still determine where house be build at local level the sheffield local plan give priority to build around the city centre and in the old industrial area in my constituency the first development call attercliffe waterside will see up to new home build by private developer citu the first have just be give planning permission credit to sheffield city council the mayor of the combine authority oliver coppard and homes england first the development will not create section funding to help with affordable housing the mayor will have to put in million to build on brownfield old industrial site these site be more expensive to build on we must understand that it be right that we build on they as priority but they be more expensive we need that contribution from the mayor and he have put it in secondly there will be no social housing on this site as purely commercial venture homes england have be extremely good it will provide some subsidy so that significant number of those home will be social housing which housing association will manage that be great but it will cost money hope the government will listen and work in partnership with the local authority that have just write to they to ask for joint agreement on how we build social housing in this country they be say look we be go to have challenge not just about build the home but about net zero build safety and decent home standard we need the government commitment that the fund will be available to deliver on those home otherwise as select committee report say few month ago all the money that should be go to build new home will go on those other priority because the first duty of landlord in the social housing sector be to look after their exist home and tenant it be important that the government listen to that and have long term clear view of what rent policy will be because that be where most of the income will come from to fund social house building it be right that the government revisit the unfair decision about debt in social housing that be put on council in the settlement by the coalition government because that burden stop council from go ahead and do what many of they want to do there be issue that hope the government respond positively to must mention local authority give my passion for local government and devolution welcome what the prime minister say about devolution not just to mayor but to local council welcome his recognition of the current challenge of finance local council there have be eight council with section decision in the last year of those be give permission to borrow capital in order to fund revenue that be not sustainable in the long term yes there be recognition there but can we really carry on with local government finance base on council tax system that look at valuation and accord to the last secretary of state michael gove be regressive be not sure that labour government can sustain that hope for proper discussion with local council about new system go forward finally on my own constituency and go for growth want to see early decision about small modular reactor we can build those in sheffield sheffield forgemasters be in my constituency hydrogen should be support that be in the propose legislation and itm power major hydrogen company be in my constituency welcome the work be do with boeing by the university of sheffield on sustainable aviation fuel boeing be now develop research into light bodied frame for aircraft again that be contribution to job help to equalise wage and living standard in my constituency and to net zero hope to see those measure come forward as matter of urgency it be wonderful to be here follow the first king speech under labour government since when labour be elect to form this country next government it be on the promise of change today king speech waste no time in do just that the package of legislation announce today place growth at its heart with an ambitious plan to raise living standard for work people welcome the announcement of crime and police bill know how important it be to my constituent in tamworth that they feel safe but under the conservatives tamworth police front desk be shut down the very notion of community policing be develop by former tamworth mp and prime minister sir robert peel so it be with great irony that local resident be currently without public police station have write to the home secretary since her appointment and look forward to work with she to make that reality visit the central england co op in my constituency to speak to staff and of shop distributive and allied workers official about the abuse they face on daily basis the consistent threat of violence from shoplifting and that as business the co op lose more than million due to shoplifting last year be therefore pleased that the prime minister have waste no time in deliver bill that will establish new criminal offence of assault shopworker in tamworth the holiday inn have be use for asylum purpose for year and the simple reality be that resident want their hotel back tamworth benefit from local tourism and as have say before in this chamber the holiday inn should be for holiday therefore welcome today announcement that the border security asylum and immigration bill include plan to end asylum hotel use it be great to host the then shadow home secretary my right hon friend the member for pontefract castleford and knottingley yvette cooper in tamworth early this month to brief she on the situation look forward to work with she in the come week to discuss the issue in great detail my constituency of tamworth and its village be at high risk when it come to flood incident but amidst chronic underfunding of the environment agency we remain fundamentally unprepared to tackle it labour have set out plan for flood resilience taskforce and look forward to present it with the finding of the flooding summit host in march this year the summit which be well attend explore new way of working and key strategic approach by local regional and national stakeholder all around we we can see that the nhs be struggle over decade of austerity and consistent de prioritisation by conservative government have see local people hit hard have have too many conversation with constituent wait month for appointment or cancer screening or in mental health crisis and unable to get support in my own constituency of tamworth the closure of the george bryan centre mean my constituent need to travel many mile to access mental health support many constituent will also welcome the child wellbee bill which promise to raise standard in education and require school to co operate with local authority on special educational need and disability inclusion it be great to see on day of labour government that we be already address this important issue many people in tamworth have have to endure the cost of living crisis that they do not ask for nor do they deserve while tamworth incredible network of community group have go above and beyond to fill the gap in support the reality be that the conservative government mismanagement of the economy hit the most vulnerable people in my constituency the hard we must take action to address soar rent price during the last few week my team have still be support people who have be make homeless or who be at risk of be make homeless it be fantastic to see the prime minister put forward renter right bill that give great right and protection for million of people who be rent and unable to afford their own home and that it include proposal to abolish section no fault eviction that should have be do long time ago it be great to open the business commission west midlands event in parliament last week along with the chamber of commerce will be work alongside business just as have be over the past eight month to spearhead investment and the strategic priority to support the town centre economy and local business tamworth have strong entrepreneurial spirit and it also have huge untapped potential the prime minister new english devolution bill will see town and city give enhanced power and duty in respect of strategic planning local transport network skill and employment support enable they to create job and improve living standard that be important to because madam deputy speaker tam worth it order that the debate be now jones debate to be resume tomorrow health services rural areas motion make and question propose that this house do now jones let get my spec on properly madam deputy speaker they have wonky leg that stick out sideways must say at the outset that have hear some excellent maiden speech today it be bit worrying to hear such good maiden speech because it make one feel somewhat mundane in comparison let also welcome the minister to her place it be pleasure to see she sit opposite this adjournment debate be the first of the new parliament and be grateful to the speaker for grant it it concern topic that be important not only to my constituent in the highland but to constituent in every rural area in the country thank the minister for her attendance and look forward to hear what she have to say hope that the debate set the tone for how government and an opposition can work together to meet the need of every citizen of the united kingdom no matter where they live recently have the great honour of be re elect to represent caithness sutherland and easter ross which be now the large constituency in the united kingdom it measure staggering sq km more than half the size of wales we be here tonight to discuss the adequacy of healthcare service in rural area and for fear of be predictable be afraid to say that the health service in the highland be not even faintly adequate recognise of course that health be devolve but year of centralisation have wreak havoc on my part of the world health service have be strip back and gutte leave my constituent with access to far too few local service let begin with general practice in scotland we have see change in vaccination service because in an effort to reduce gps workload gp contract scotland remove their vaccination capability that be of huge concern to crofter in my constituency who might cut themselves on piece of barbed wire and need tetanus vaccination as quickly as possible the same go for anyone in need of shingle flu covid or travel vaccine they must travel staggering mile or more to the near where they will face further wait owe to backlog result from heavy workload want to keep the tradition alive madam deputy speaker this be my first intervention during an adjournment debate in the new parliament commend the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone for raise an issue that be very important to and to my constituency also congratulate he on his excellent victory in the poll he have do exceptionally well hail from rural constituency where my own doctor have to service huge number of people and the inadequacy of help for rural constituent be abundantly clear to do the hon member not agree that the current postcode lottery must end and that access to gps physiotherapist nutritionist and mental health service for farming and other rural community must be at least on par with those in city and large town why should those in rural community be second class citizen in their own country the hon member make his point with his customary charm it be no wonder that he be so well like in this place because he always speak for his constituent have talk about the delay in vaccination which also apply to the lifesave vaccination that baby must have the scottish government take one size fit all approach that frankly do not work in remote rural area such as mine the retention and recruitment of gps and other healthcare worker be crucial but poor wage and term and condition and lack of proper travel reimbursement all lead to general impression that the game be simply not worth the candle that be why we be miss key worker and doctor and why we be pay through the nose for locum and temporary staff madam deputy speaker can you believe that nhs highland have spend million on locum staffing in the past year that be almost of its entire budget an eye watering sum could that money not have be spend much well for example on care home hospital or pain clinic that have be force to close apologise for come bit late to this debate primary care be ask to do more in rural area than in urban setting pile pressure on gps pharmacist and dentist yet they struggle to recruit staff as my hon friend say dental practice in street in my constituency have be without an nhs dentist on its book for month despite its good effort do my hon friend agree that we must explore way in which we can incentivise healthcare professional to practise in rural area absolutely endorse that be glad that say in my opening remark that my experience in very remote part of scotland apply to other part of the united kingdom what we have just hear prove that this be the case nhs scotland have halt all new build and repair to health centre across the entire country which be another problem for healthcare have say already how big my constituency be just by commute or do house visit healthcare staff will rack up mile easily because the distance be so great at that point their reimbursement per mile be more than halve which do not encourage people to get involve it be in fact discrimination against healthcare professional who live in rural community training be overwhelmingly base in urban area and there be very little incentive to get people to come and work in rural area other factor such as lack of housing and job opportunity feed into this problem there be another issue want to raise the lack of woman health provision which be pretty severe in my maiden speech in speak about the need to restore maternity service to caithness seven year later that be more important than ever caithness general hospital use to have consultant lead maternity service which mean that expectant mother could have their baby locally in the far north of scotland it be downgrade when be my constituency member of the scottish parliament at that time have more influence and get it restore since then however the maternity service have be downgrade again and there appear to be no movement from the scottish government to reverse that wish that some member from the party of the scottish government be present today let give an example of what this situation mean pregnant mother have to make mile round trip in the car to deliver their baby imagine trip like that in the middle of winter and on rickety rackety road in the highland in pair of twin be bear one be bear in golspie and the other be bear mile away in inverness it be miracle that those child survive and that neither mother nor child have perish have be call for safety audit all along but there have never be one we know perfectly well what the result would be the arrangement would be deem unsafe if not breach of human right it be not just about maternity service woman health have be remove from the far north routine trip to see gynaecologist and get diagnosis for life threaten ovarian cyst or for endometriosis mean travel the same huge distance if woman be lucky enough to get an appointment before her condition have progress too far for her safety wonder what we can do to encourage healthcare professional to relocate to remote area because the health and wellbeing of their wife and daughter must surely be factor when they consider move for child grow up in the far north it be no well the waiting list for child and adolescent mental health assessment be three year for neurodevelopmental screening for the diagnosis of dyslexia autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and so on it be four year that be the majority of their time at school one family speak to during the election have wait year for diagnosis that be disaster dentistry have already be mention and we know that intervention be crucial for long term dental health be grateful to my hon friend for give way and apologise to he for be catch out by the early start of this adjournment debate do he agree that it would be really helpful if the new government achieve quick win to raise morale in rural area where service have be so deplete for so long this apply in west cornwall for example where we can not call on service from the north or south or west very easily in those area as in other we have dentistry desert and the nhs and care service be experience their big crisis in their history what we need for example be for the west cornwall hospital to re establish the urgent treatment centre overnight those kind of quick win could achieve the lifting of morale within the service and start move thing forward and upward from where they be at present my hon friend make good point and shall touch upon his sentiment in my closing remark as many in the chamber know perhaps new member do not myself be carer be carer for my wife so be very happy that my party have put carer at the top of our agenda my party leader have speak about be carer himself we desperately need reform and believe that the carer allowance should be introduce at high rate in way be declare an interest here in that be an unpaid carer but we have to look at this be recently inform of constituent who be move from one care home to another one mile away in the highland that be three and bit hour journey each way for the love one to go and visit that old man we can see why this be not great for morale be from the highland love my native highland and care passionately about where come from but think that we need urgent intervention this be my ask of the minister recognise the nobility of the intent to address these problem at uk level and look forward to work with the government in these endeavour but the fact be that there be not the delivery under devolution that there should be be sorry that no scottish national party member be here be committed devolutionist be part of the scottish constitutional convention and my name be on the claim of right for scotland yet find it incredibly disappointing that the outcome be lot bad than they be when be in government in the scottish parliament in coalition with the labour party we see progress between and when the snp come in now we see that thing have go backwards this be the main issue on the doorstep in scotland so hope that the labour government can work hard at improve thing ask they in cordial way to do everything that can be do to improve the relationship with the scottish government and perhaps encourage the scottish government to look at good practice in the rest of the uk and adopt that be not talk about hypothecation or about unroll devolution but by work together perhaps we can achieve something also it would be great if we could encourage nhs england to work closely with nhs scotland because it be complete and utter nonsense that people who could cross the border and get treatment have be prevent from do so by bureaucracy sometimes by politic of the not so clever sort or by the computer system not match that be nonsense if someone live in the south of scotland can get their operation do in newcastle let we just go for it look forward to labour government give extra money to the health service and be sure they will we will be look closely at how that happen there will of course be barnett consequential that will put that money into the devolved welsh assembly the scottish parliament and the northern ireland assembly hope that the uk government will look closely at where those barnett consequential go will they go where we would hope they would go namely to improve the health service to shorten waiting list to sort out the nonsense and to give the standard of health service that my constituent and believe everyone in rural part of the uk be cry out for it be privilege to be the first minister of this new labour government to respond to an adjournment debate be grateful to the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone for raise this important matter and indeed for his kind word hope we can begin this parliament as we mean to go on by be candid about the formidable challenge that the nhs face as my right hon friend the secretary of state say on his first day in the job the nhs be break and it will be the task of this government to build new nhs for the future that mean the nhs in our rural and coastal area no less than the nhs in our town and city agree with the hon member for strangford jim shannon on that point face these hard truth do not take away from the heroic effort of the people work in health and care who have do their utmost in incredibly difficult circumstance we all owe they on behalf of our constituent debt of unende gratitude instead we want to focus our attention on what need to be do include early action to improve access to primary care dentistry and dental health service in particular we await the conclusion of thorough investigation undertake by the distinguished surgeon lord darzi to properly understand the scale of the problem the government will then begin work on an ambitious programme of action year plan to put the nhs back on its foot it be privilege to be part of labour government who be committed to fix the nhs and make it fit for the future as the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross say the department responsibility stretch only to the nhs in england healthcare be devolve in scotland wales and northern ireland and it will continue to be so congratulate the hon gentleman on be first out of the trap to secure this debate on behalf of his constituent as committed advocate for his constituent in one of the most rural part of scotland he have deep understanding of matter affect rural community as we have hear this evening he also have deep understanding of care about which have often hear he speak in this chamber it be good to see he back again do just that can not speak in detail about the nhs in scotland of course but can speak about many of the common issue affect access to care that be relevant to rural constituency in england scotland northern ireland and wales know how rural the hon gentleman constituency be and know the particular challenge that create in access gps dentist and emergency care and in access woman health and maternity service an issue he have be passionately raise for so long maternity service be problem across the united kingdom but accept the example he outline few place in england be as remote as the hon gentleman constituency but be very aware of similar issue affect more rural area near my bristol south constituency we have hear from the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke and for st ives andrew george about morale and the difficulty we face in the south west hope that in the year ahead we can share and learn from one another across all of our border in many rural area the challenge of improve access to service be compound by travel time and by the recruitment and retention of staff we must recognise the importance of design service that reflect an area particular circumstance which be grow challenge as the chief medical officer have point out in his report people be move out of town and city to coastal semi rural and rural area as they age at the time that people be most likely to need care they be increasingly live in the place where it be most difficult to provide that care in england integrate care system will have key role to play in design service that meet the need of local people to do this they will need to work with clinician and local community at place or neighbourhood level we know that excellent primary care be an essential foundation for improve access tackle the root cause of poor health and tackle problem early so that people remain in well health for long and hopefully do not need to access secondary and tertiary care at the same level that be why labour have pledge as part of our health mission to train thousand more gps and bring back the family doctor and that apply to all the nation we be also do more to use the transformative power of technology there be enormous potential in idea such as virtual ward which allow care to be deliver in people own home such model of care can have disproportionate benefit in area where rurality be barrier to care equally we be committed to see the nhs app reach its full potential under the new government we understand that some people will need support to use that technology and we be aware of the challenge of rural broadband but we be committed to make the benefit accessible to all the minister have commit the new labour government to address those issue but will she specifically address the matter of the two coroner report into avoidable excess death as result of very long wait for emergency service in cornwall they be never address by the previous conservative government the report be about not just the hour spend wait sometimes elderly frail people be on the floor for or more hour but the fact that sometimes or more ambulance greet patient when they arrive at the emergency department two coroner report be send to the then secretary of state but there be never an adequate response very much hope the new labour government will review the failing of the previous government and address those very serious concern which affect many other rural area be aware of the issue face the south west and when in opposition speak in the local medium about some of the ambulance challenge be not aware of those report but if the hon gentleman write to with the detail will happily look into the issue and get back to he we also recognise the additional cost of provide service in rural area for example in travel and staff time that be why the funding formula use by nhs england to allocate fund to integrate care board include an element to well reflect need in some rural coastal and remote area the nhs face significant challenge it need fundamental reform the prime minister be personally commit to reset the uk government relationship with devolved government in scotland wales and northern ireland echo the prime minister word today about our commitment to rural constituency across the entire country and hope we can work with hon member from across the house include the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross welcome the minister clear commitment to england scotland wales and northern ireland and particularly to northern ireland let declare an interest be member of the ulster farmers union know that the ulster farmers union back home in conjunction with the nfu here have be try to work with the health service and with all those with responsibility in this area on the issue of suicide farmer mostly work on their own and suffer from anxiety and depression they face pressure from finance and pressure from the bureaucracy that exist in farming know the minister be compassionate and understanding mean that honestly when it come to address that issue do she think that it must be do in conjunction with the farmer union try to work together to make thing well must be step in the right direction as ever the hon gentleman make valid point shall certainly ask my colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs about that his point be extremely well make know his constituency in northern ireland very well let say that we be very committed to work with hon member across the house to share idea the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross have put forward more idea about how that can happen do not promise to implement all of those thing but will certainly look at they we want to work very closely across all jurisdiction so that we can make progress for all our constituent to improve the health outcome across the four nation of the united kingdom question put and agree to house adjourn
