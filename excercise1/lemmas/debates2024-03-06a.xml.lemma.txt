sincerely thank my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers for secure this adjournment debate and for her powerful speech she really bring the subject to life through the example from her constituency of people experience in hospital they be very difficult story to hear and be very sorry to hear of time when it sound like the care for people love one have fall short my right hon friend make some powerful point that want to address start with the fact that as she say there be many thousand of people live with dementia and the number be only expect to increase indeed there will be more than million by many people with dementia will also be live with other health condition at the moment it be estimate that around quarter of the bed in hospital be be use by patient with dementia so ensure that people receive the right care when they be in hospital with dementia be really important as be do our utmost to avoid unnecessary admission and ensure that people be discharge from hospital on timely basis it be really worth emphasise the point that my right hon friend make about dignity and the fact that every single person count at whatever stage of their life there be challenge to ensure that people live with dementia have that dignity particularly when they be in hospital too pay tribute to the many unpaid carer who be look after their love one with dementia know what huge burden and challenge that can be however much someone love somebody there be huge demand on they when they be care for somebody with dementia it can be very difficult very distressing and absolutely relentless however much they love they pay tribute to all carer who be do that my right hon friend speak first about lisa rutter who very sadly lose her mother who be live with dementia during the pandemic in hospital if hear my right hon friend correctly thank lisa rutter for the work that she be do as the founder of dementia club uk it be fabulous to be support other people to look after love one with dementia or indeed those with dementia themselves my right hon friend talk about the time lisa mother spend in hospital and how for instance lisa know what her mother need but feel that she be not listen to and that it may have contribute to her mother death my right hon friend also talk about the visit restriction during the pandemic will talk about those in moment my right hon friend talk about another constituent whose wife be in hospital she rightly talk about the importance of mobilise somebody with dementia and how her constituent wife be nearly give the wrong medication which could have be fatal she speak about the importance of his intervention she also speak about constituent who be carer for their father and the importance of mobilisation and some of the communication challenge for somebody with dementia my right hon friend talk about one person who have be scream all night as describe by the staff actually the family member who know they understand that they be call for help as they need to go to the toilet that bring to life how difficult it can be when somebody have dementia and be not necessarily able to articulate their need and what they want those who know they well will often know what they be try to say or communicate but that can be difficult in hospital when they may be be look after by staff who simply do not know they well enough to know what they mean my right hon friend talk about food be leave uneaten if somebody be not eat in hospital clearly they be likely to lose weight and their condition may deteriorate she also talk about medication be stop and she talk particularly about somebody whose partner have early onset dementia and have be cop fairly well at home he walk into and that be very sadly the last time he walk that emphasise the challenge of keep people move and maintain their ability to be mobile during hospital stay she also describe the fight to visit outside visit hour very much hear my right hon friend ask on visitor access volunteer be train in dementia care as well as staff training and avoid discharge delay among other thing will pick up on some of those first on the challenge of care for people with dementia when in hospital many hospital have work hard to do well for patient with dementia for example create dementia friendly environment by change the colour and lie out ensure that staff be train in dementia and have dementia lead and dementia lead nurse as well as have training for volunteer standard training in care for people with dementia be available through nhs england for staff and volunteer clearly my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet describe example where care fall short have no doubt that across the nhs with the work already take place we can go far will raise the point that she make about secondary care with my colleague the minister for health and secondary care so that we can work together on ensure that care be right in hospital he also have oversight of workforce and we should focus on whether the training that know be available be be take up by enough staff consider the number of people in hospital with dementia on visit my right hon friend speak about subject that be close to my heart have be involve in some of the decision about social care visit restriction during the pandemic and know how hard those decision be weigh up the infection control concern and ensure people could spend time with love one we have be put in place change to care quality commission regulation to make visit fundamental right fundamental part of care and fundamental standard of care to ensure well access for love one to their family member in care home and in hospital know in particular how important that be for people with dementia among other the cqc be consult on the implementation of the regulatory change which will be live shortly believe we have take significant step to address concern express about visit another thing my right hon friend speak about be fast discharge be very alert to the risk of patient deconditione in hospital particularly patient with dementia that be why over the past year or so we have work hard with the nhs to get well at identify patient at great risk of deconditione in particular those with dementia on their admission to hospital we have do early discharge planning and have be get care transfer hub establish all across the country which will do the work on more complex discharge often someone with dementia may need more access to social care we may need to increase the access to availability and supply of social care so that it be there for those who will need it when they leave hospital we have make some real progress on that over the past year
