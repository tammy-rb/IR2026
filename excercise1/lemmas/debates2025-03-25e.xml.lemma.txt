for his policy of the independent review into datum and statistic on sex and gender by professor alice sullivan be grateful to professor sullivan for her report sex and gender identity be not always the same and it be important for patient that we record both accurately know the house will share my concern at some of the finding from professor sullivan report such as trans patient not be invite for cancer screening because of how their gender be record can assure the house that be already act on report last week instruct the health service to immediately suspend application for nhs number change for to safeguard child take such action do not prevent the nhs from recording recognise and respect trans people gender identity thank the secretary of state for his response which will give much need reassurance to patient across the uk any public body that fail to accurately record sex and instead conflate it with gender put people at serious risk of harm unfortunately this type of organisational capture have be widespread across scotland with devastating consequence can the secretary of state assure that he will raise this issue with his counterpart in the scottish government to ensure that nhs scotland do not put my constituent at risk will absolutely undertake to share the approach we be take with my counterpart across the united kingdom the approach have always take be one that understand the importance of biological sex that recognise understand and support that someone gender identity may not always match their biological sex and that seek to navigate way through what have be an extremely toxic and sometimes harmful debate in way that protect the sex base right of woman and protect tran people and their identity know that my colleague across government be take an equally sensitive approach and think it would be in everyone interest if we see similar approach across the whole of the united kingdom it be important not just in the provision of service but in accurate datum and research that we make that distinction which do not in any way undermine respect for people gender identity the inquest into the tragic death of young woman who live in eastleigh have highlight the importance of continuity of specialist care for vulnerable people who move home my constituent alex be still wait for an appointment for ongoing specialist care three year after move to eastleigh will the minister meet to discuss the provision of mental healthcare in my constituency this question be about sex and gender do not worry be sure that the secretary of state have

gentleman confirm what meeting he have have with secretary of state for science innovation and technology to discuss the reliability of the datum on sex that be intend to be use by the digital verification platform in the data use and access bill be grateful to the shadow minister for her question speak to the science secretary on too frequent basis on daily basis he and be both look very carefully at the finding of the sullivan review and work through its implication for both the health and care service for which be responsible and for the government digital and data service for which he be responsible the uk health security agency for which the secretary of state be responsible publish health statistic this include datum on sexually transmit infection which be publish by sexual orientation and sex however footnote state that woman be define in the dataset as woman and tran woman which do somewhat undermine the value of the datum what will the secretary of state do to ensure that datum be not just collect properly but publish and present in way that be most clinically useful the shadow minister raise good example of how conflation of sex and gender identity be not helpful both in term of datum analysis and of recognise health inequality it be also not helpful in make sure that we understand variance between people base on their different background and characteristic and that we provide targeted personalised and effective healthcare that deal with healthcare inequality that be why we be carefully study the recommendation make by professor sullivan with view to make sure that we be meet the need of everyone include the trans community who understand not least because of the way that the debate have be conduct in recent year be anxious about the implication of the report however genuinely think that the report will lead to well more inclusive and fair outcome for everyone include the trans community cancer care west of england what step his department be take to improve cancer care in the west of england know the hon member be acutely aware of the impact that cancer can have on family we be committed to catch cancer early and treat it fast we have

inequity be absolutely clear that we need to make sure that the job evaluation scheme look at staff across the piece and that people be reward appropriately for the work they be ask to do we will do that as part of our discussion with the nhs staff council and we will be work consistently with staff as part of the year plan to ensure that people be reward we depend on these staff and we want to encourage they to be part of the nhs workforce that be the approach we intend to take nhs waiting lists what step his department be take to reduce the number of people wait for nhs treatment the week

west hertfordshire remain concerned about the significant delay to the redevelopment of watford general with the chancellor already bring second emergency budget before the house tomorrow and with care home hospice and charity face unsustainable pressure from this government national insurance increase what reassurance can the minister give my constituent that the labour party truly care about healthcare rather than score political point the irony there be one big difference between what this government be do and what the conservative party do for year which be that this government will actually deliver new watford general hospital where the conservative party fail do ministers agree that logical conclusion of the darzi report be that the national care service that we be commit to create must be free at the point of use as lord darzi find as long as the social care system remain mean test and the nhs be universally free service unmet care need will continue to put unsustainable pressure on our health service that be vital issue the casey commission will look at how good to create fair and affordable adult social care system and at which structural reform will be need where

quickly to ensure that family do not receive the same death sentence that our late friend do that conclude question time on point of order mr speaker since january have table name day write parliamentary question to the department of health and social care fourteen have receive hold response mean that just one be answer on time to give simple example ask how many time the minister have meet community pharmacy england four day later receive standard hold answer which state that it will not be possible to answer this question within the usual time period it then take five day for an answer to come which state minister meet regularly with external stakeholder on variety of topic include but not limit to pharmacy may ask your advice mr speaker what mechanism be in place to ensure that name day question be answer on time if they continue not to be answer on time how can escalate the matter far first be disappointed that question be not be answer but be not responsible for ministerial answer hope that those on the treasury bench include the secretary of state have take on board the importance of reply name day question be call that because they be mean to be answer on the day that be name be very disappointed the department may be overwork if that be the case perhaps we ought to bring in staff from other departments to ensure that question be answer on time know that the secretary of state will have immediately make note to ensure that those question be answer asylum hotels and illegal channel crossings urgent question to ask the home secretary to make statement on asylum hotel and illegal immigrant cross the channel as the right hon member be aware the home office discharge its statutory duty to provide accommodation and to support destitute asylum seeker through seven asylum accommodation and support service contract those contract be enter into by the previous government commence in and be split between three provider clearsprings ready homes ltd serco ltd and mears significant element of the behaviour and performance of one of the sub contractor of clearsprings ready homes fall short of what we would expect from government supplier that be why the home office have inform clearsprings ready homes that it must exit the arrangement with subcontractor in its supply chain stay belvedere hotels we will not hesitate to take further action in respect of clearsprings and its wide supply chain if that prove necessary and we be conduct full audit of our supply chain we expect the high standard from those contract to provide essential service and this government will always hold they to account for delivery performance and value for money where there be concern about how contractor or their subcontractor be discharge their contractual obligation we will not hesitate to take swift and decisive action the home office progress matter relate to these contract with its provider in commercial confidentiality will not give running commentary but assure the house that whatever the position with any of its provider the home office remain focused on maintain continuity of service and ensure that our statutory obligation be meet at all time and have contingency plan in this regard none of that take away from our commitment to reduce the huge cost of asylum hotel which remain our priority in relation to channel crossing this government have put forward serious credible plan to restore order to our asylum system include tough enforcement power ramp up return to their high level for more than half decade and major crackdown on illegal working to end the false promise of job use by gang to sell space on boat increase law enforcement action and disruption be already show some indication of pressure on the business model of the gang and we be introduce new power for law enforcement to use against the vile trade in people smuggle and trafficking last summer the government be elect on promise to end the use of asylum hotel well it have now be nine month so let we see how they be get on the use of asylum hotel have go up by since the general election it have not go down it have go up some mainly illegal immigrant be now in those hotel cost hard work taxpayer around billion year it be completely unacceptable that taxpayer be ask to foot bill that size the people live in those hotel break our law by come here from france which be manifestly safe country that nobody need to leave have very simple question for the minister when will the government end the use of asylum hotel during the election campaign last summer and subsequently the government also promise to smash the gang but that promise now lie in tatter in the nine month since the election people nearly people have illegally cross the english channel which be increase on the same period month before in fact be even bad since january more people have cross the english channel illegally than in any year in history this be the bad year it be bad than the previous bad year so thing be get bad not well they have not smash the gang but capitulate to they the hon lady mention return most of those return do not relate to people who arrive by small boat in fact those people be return who come by small boat amount to only about of small boat arrival do not know how let of people who arrive by small boat stay here be deterrent at the weekend we see briefing to the press and not to parliament mr speaker that the government be now consider some kind of offshore removal scheme that sound vaguely familiar at last they have realise that some kind of removal deterrent be need will the minister now apologise for cancel the rwanda deterrent before it even start and as consequence lose control of our border will not take any lesson from the shadow minister in his last three month as immigration minister nearly people cross the channel in small boat but he be complain about half that level of crossing happen in the past three month neither will take any lesson from someone who serve in government who preside over situation where at its height there be people in more than hotel we be get grip on the problem by start up asylum processing once more but we inherit huge backlog there be fall in asylum processing in the run up to the general election with more than people stick without be process in the asylum system we be get grip of that but by definition the backlog and chaos that the conservatives leave we be take time do the minister share my astonishment at the shadow home secretary argument give that the conservatives waste ten of million of pound on accommodation that could not be use and billion on hotel the state of the asylum system that we inherit be unbelievable will the minister commit to reform that seriously dysfunctional system include scrutinise asylum contract with the provider when the break clause come up next year we inherit system in chaos and series of asylum contract worth billion of pound that be year long with break clause in so we be look seriously at what we can do to get well value for public money in those contract the action on stay belvedere hotels ltd be one example of the work we be do to drive well value in the contract that we inherit we will not tolerate the behaviour of subcontractor or contractor who do not provide good value for money which be why we have insist that clearsprings ready home remove stay belvedere hotels ltd from its supply chain call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be pleasure to be back in the chamber to hear the shadow home secretary great hit of conservative failure from the last parliament whether it be cut to neighbourhood policing or the woeful handling of the asylum system under the previous government in which he be home office minister of course the home office should ensure that all asylum accommodation provider deliver value for money safety and security but tinker with contract will not change the fact that asylum hotel be lose lose they eat up taxpayer money and leave local council and community to sort out the mess to pick date at random the share of asylum application that receive an initial decision within six month fall from in the second quarter of to just towards the end of the last government time in office when do the minister think that the processing of application will speed up so that the backlog will come down community such as mine will get the use of their hotel back and those grant refugee status can integrate and contribute to our economy certainly agree with the hon lady that the shadow home secretary sound like broken record we be well used to he run that argument in this place also agree that the key to deal with hotel be to get the system back up and run from the chaos that it be in can tell the hon lady that asylum processing at first decision have ramp up considerably and we be get through the backlog we inherit but there be also huge backlog by definition in the appeal system partly cause by the legacy appeal the dash to end the legacy system ahead of the fantasy rwanda scheme beginning which have lead to big backlog in appeal we be look to see what we can do about that because it be important that we get fast and fair system from end to end and that include appeal because the previous government lose complete control of our border the leyland hotel in my constituency of south ribble be close down three year ago yes three year ago and use for asylum seeker there be chronic undersupply of hotel in south ribble chorley preston and central lancashire can ministers provide any indication at all of when the hotel will cease to be use as an asylum hotel be ask that question every single week want to get out of hotel as quickly as be feasible will not name particular date because that be pointless thing to do we have to get through the appeal system and the first asylum processing system so that we can move people through the system much more quickly we also need to continue our work on ramp up return which have see huge increase the high figure for the last five year and we intend to continue with that process call the chair of the home affairs committee the medium be report that the early the contract can be break be september next year can the minister confirm whether that be the case what liability do the taxpayer have for contract end today that we can not get out of until september next year the right hon lady be talk about the prime contractor which in this case be clearsprings ready home as with the other two contractor the break clause be with it we have approval or not of sub prime contractor stay belvedere hotels ltd be sub prime contractor and as the home office we have withdraw our approval for it to be in the supply chain the shadow home secretary have nerve to come to this house and make that argument when we in the community see the damage that the contract he manage do to the public purse shall we revisit some of those great hit his contract put council and clearsprings against each other push up price and make it impossible for local community to help those house there he cause absolute chaos have in my hand one of the letter that the hon gentleman government be present to people who be refugee give they less than five day notice of where they be be move mean that school place have to be hastily reorganise and child have to be hastily re clothed because of the decision he make on public fund absolutely no saving be make in the way in which he manage the contract will my hon friend make commitment and pledge to all of we who have have to deal with clearsprings and its chaotic management that when she have the opportunity to renegotiate the contract or possibly even break it for good she will put public value for money first and not repeat the chaos of the shadow home secretary we be do all that we can with the exist contract to drive value for money and we be also look to pilot some other potential alternative to supply call the father of the house under the refugee convention we can automatically deport illegal migrant who come here but under the european convention on human right we can not have probe new clause move on my behalf in committee on this subject and with your permission mr speaker hope to move it again on report know that the minister can not answer absolutely now but will she look at that new clause in constructive spirit surely we can all agree that we do not want criminal enter this country illegally certainly agree with the father of the house on that subject we have small but perfectly form debate albeit in his absence on his new clause and look forward to debate it with he on report of the border security asylum and immigration bill think still have the large number of asylum seeker in hotel in the country with more than and have experience of clearsprings and stay belvedere it would be really helpful if the new contractual arrangement involve full consultation with some of the organisation work at the frontline of support asylum seeker so that some of the lesson can be learn about past performance to improve future performance be more than happy to meet with the right hon gentleman to talk about his experience on the ground with respect to both stay belvedere hotels ltd and clearsprings ready homes hope be not the only person here who be utterly depressed by the complete lack of compassion show by the shadow home secretary and the lack of recognition that the people we be talk about have story of their own and have experience horror that we can barely even imagine be it not right that we look at this in more thoughtful way to reduce cost to the taxpayer and help those who will be successful asylum seeker to integrate would it not be wise to allow people who be asylum seeker to work after be here for three month those asylum seeker who have not have their claim process within year through no fault of their own be allow access to work be unconvinced that allow access to work early would do anything other than create more demand for people to come here it be widely accept across the whole country include in my constituency that the conservatives leave we with open border with people cross on their watch and the opening of asylum hotel cost our taxpayer million per day this government have already establish border security command and have deport people that be record number up from what the opposition could achieve we be also bring in counter terror power to take on the smuggling gang do the minister agree that the opposition need to get behind our bill so that those counter terror power can empower the national crime agency to take out the smuggling gang my hon friend be correct that the border security asylum and immigration bill which have be through committee and be await its report stage will create counter terror style power that will help we prevent some of these crossing and disrupt the sophisticated criminal smuggling gang that be allow to take hold across the channel unabate by the conservative party it will enable we to tackle this problem at source by work across border with colleague in other country tackle the people smuggle route as well as the gang when in opposition the labour party talk tough about what it would do when it enter government as my right hon friend the shadow home secretary have say though small boat arrival and hotel use be both up and asylum seeker be be wave through the system just to make the minister number look good this all reek of arrogance and complacency and we be now see the real world impact for example wethersfield in my constituency have see the number of asylum seeker user go up while labour talk tough before the election it take thing off the statute book before it replace they with anything else so when will the minister actually come to the house with serious proposal to reduce the number of small boat arrival which have go up by over on her government watch the right hon gentleman say that wethersfield be now get more people but it be still not hold the number that his government plan for it to hold when it be open so that be rather an odd argument for he to make if he be serious about reduce the problem at our border would have think that he would want to support the counter terrorism style power in the border security asylum and immigration bill but it seem that he be not under this government illegal workplace raid and arrest be up by third while that be welcome we all know from our high street and constituency that there be still way to go so can the minister confirm that we will continue at pace on this trajectory to send clear message that the uk will not tolerate people abuse the asylum system or indeed illegal activity in any form yes of course we have to crack down on abuse of our asylum system but also on the exploitation of vulnerable and desperate people by vicious criminal gang during committee proceeding on the border security asylum and immigration bill say to the minister that it would only be matter of time before the government concoct some sort of rwanda style deportation scheme even do not think that it would come so quickly if weekend press report be to be believe can the minister say that those report be totally not true and will she now rule out ever implement third country deportation scheme like the one introduce by the conservatives be not go to comment on leak welcome the decision to close napier barrack in my constituency where there have be long stand concern about condition among other issue what assurance can the minister give my constituent as well as those be hold there that this site will be operate properly until it close in september if my hon and learn friend want to talk to about any of the detail would be happy to listen but of course we want to operate that site properly and appropriately until we hand it back to the ministry of defence in september give that the government do not believe in send illegal immigrant to third country such as rwanda can the minister explain how they plan to deport people who have destroy their document so that we do not know their country of origin or be the solution to keep those people here forever in hotel or in one of the million home that labour plan to build mr deputy speaker sorry mr speaker do not know why be call you mr deputy speaker today have go back very long time to when you be but that be so long ago that can scarcely remember it my apology mr speaker the right hon lady should remember that the rwanda scheme be about deport people for good not deal with their asylum claim that be not in any way what this government would ever consider do which be why that scheme be cancel the shadow home secretary can complain all he want but while he be in the home office people cross the channel with thousand house in hundred of hotel across the country fail rwanda scheme and complete freeze on asylum decision making be the reason that the cost of hotel rise to million day everything stop just to send four volunteer to rwanda and the shadow home secretary be responsible for the chaos do my hon friend agree that the only party in this house that vote for the border security asylum and immigration bill will be the party that sort this chaos out agree with my hon friend we all want to stop the perilous channel crossing that be cost vulnerable people their life so what step be the government now take to boost further co operation with europol so that we can smash the gang that be profit from misfortune we have put more resource into europol to co operate with european partner across border operationally we be work across europe we have new agreement with the german government and an agreement on sanction and illicit finance with the italian government and the calais group have meet in london we be do lot of work with source area and country such as vietnam not only on return but on counter some of the advert that tell lie about the kind of life that await those who get on perilous small boat we be work with our international colleague across the piece both diplomatically and operationally to try to put pressure on the international criminal gang and begin to close down this evil trade under the conservative party the asylum budget balloon to over billion take of our overseas development assistance for in country refugee cost mainly hotel against an oecd average of make we big outlier internationally welcome the commitment to speed up processing and reduce hotel use but with the aid budget be reduce to from can the minister reassure that an ever increase chunk of small aid budget will not be spend in country instead of on support vital poverty alleviation work internationally it be clearly important that overseas development money be use to try to prevent the flow of people that have be the result of collapse in various country we in the home office will do all we can to minimise the spend that we currently take from the overseas development aid budget mr speaker you will know that most of the illegal cross channel migrant who come to this country come through my constituency at the processing centre in manston as such have take particular interest in this subject what have to say be certainly not go to be popular either among conservative members or among labour members but neither be it go to be populist the home secretary and not together both visit the calais area recently we see there hundred if not thousand of very determined very desperate people who be go to risk their life to cross the channel the conservatives rwanda scheme and this government much vaunted smashing of the gang will not solve that problem there be no quick fix and the only solution will be long term and international in that context do the minister believe that cut overseas aid be go to do anything other than worsen the problem suggest that the right hon gentleman raise that issue with the chancellor it beggar belief that the conservatives have the gall to question the action we have take as government in clear up the mess they leave behind because they simply stop do anything other than waste billion of taxpayer money we have return people with no right to be here we have increase border force and we have increase work with our european ally and our intelligence service but there be more to do it be mess and people in our country feel let down and deep mistrust of politician that be cause division and rumour mill to develop and fester in our community can the minister tell what we be do as government to rebuild public trust and community cohesion do she agree that that should start right here in this house believe that people need to think about the language they use and the impression of human being they give when they talk about this very emotive issue it raise huge concern know as government we have certainly get to do all we can to try to reassure people that we can get this system back under control after find chaotic mess when we come into government recently write to the minister to request the estimate saving the government expect from the closure of asylum seeker hotel in response be inform that while the home office publish datum on the number of people house in hotel it do not report on the number of room occupy hotel accommodate people in share room incur significantly different cost from one where individual occupy separate room yet that critical distinction be overlook give that effective policy decision must be base on clear evidence will the minister commit to publishing room occupancy datum to ensure accountability and informed decision making will write to the hon gentleman can assure asylum seeker that they will be treat with kindness and compassion in my human right city of york however tragically mother at full term lose her baby at hotel will the minister give guarantee that pregnant woman will not be move from hotel to hotel so that they can have continuity of service and safe pregnancy that certainly should not be happen if my hon friend want to talk to about it will try to see what happen in that instance directive from the treasury report in the times appear to suggest that house building by the government will help with the backlog of asylum seeker stay in hotel do the minister believe that individual who have arrive in the uk illegally should be give access to social housing ahead of british citizen no back in the conservatives when in government tell the town of blackpool that they would use the metropole hotel as an asylum hotel for three month they lose control of the border and drive the asylum system into chaos and we be still pay the price now in one of the most deprived community in the country do the minister agree that we need to close these hotel as soon as possible and give back that prime real estate especially in coastal community such as blackpool to help the tourism industry thrive we do not believe that it be sustainable to keep hotel use indefinitely and we be work to close hotel small boat crossing be up since the general election the number of illegal asylum seeker in the asylum hotel in my constituency of broxbourne be also up illegal asylum seeker be be prioritise for gp appointment and school place which be outrageous to and my hard work constituent can the minister tell the house when she will meet her manifesto commitment of close the asylum hotel in my constituency of broxbourne our aim be to close asylum hotel and get out of what we feel be an unsustainable situation as quickly as practicable be sure that the minister agree that one of the root cause of this crisis be the last government politically motivated action first slow down and then freeze the processing of asylum application have asylum seeker wait or more year for decision the british public want to see contribution by asylum seeker to the system reduce the public burden on taxpayer so have the minister consider lift the ban on work so that people wait more than six month for decision can contribute to our tax system until decision be make asylum seeker who wait long than year be allow to work so long as that wait have not be cause by they that is wait through no fault of their own we have that system now and be not consider shorten the length of time that must elapse before work be allow rise order question be get considerably long can we keep they on point like the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale have visit calais on number of occasion and have meet people there who be desperate they be victim of war human right abuse environmental degradation and sheer poverty and desperation they do not cross the channel without reason to do it what conversation be the minister have with those in european country north africa and the middle east about the root cause of the huge number of people globally who be seek asylum at the present time inhumanity and deportation will not work do not apologise for deport people who have no right to be here or who have be through the system and be discover neither to be asylum seeker nor to have any right to stay in the country accept the right hon gentleman point about the desperate situation that people be in they could claim asylum in the country they be in and we need to work with our counterpart in the european union and along all the route to see what we can do to divert those people who be seek well life in our country and see if we can look after they close to home under this labour government illegal work raid and arrest be up by third do the minister agree that that send clear message that the uk will not and should not tolerate those who abuse our immigration system and that we will crack down on illegal activity in all its form yes illegal working arrest and visit have increase by more people have be arrest more people have be fin we be seek to ban those who abuse illegal worker often underpay they and treat they like modern slave from run company the fine be now per illegal worker there be no reason why legitimate small business should be undermine by illegal working and illegal practice be the government consider send fail asylum seeker to overseas return hub be not go to comment on leak it be always pleasure to see the shadow home secretary shoot himself in the foot particularly when he bring sawn off shotgun to do the job the government be get grip on the issue of asylum hotel and the conservatives should be ashamed we hear in the border security asylum and immigration bill committee how child be be target for organ harvesting and for sexual abuse and be go miss from the system the conservatives put bills on the statute book that they never implement and be pleased that this government have commit to close asylum hotel they have give the assurance that they will not be add hotel in bournemouth when the conservative on the bill committee define deterrent they say it be about detain and deporting do my hon friend agree that the conservatives neither detain nor deport so we should stop call the rwanda gimmick deterrent agree with my hon friend between the announcement of the rwanda scheme and its ending people come across in small boat last month we learn that overseas development assistance would be cut from to of gross national income some of we assume that this saving would be find in the closure of so call asylum hotel but now we learn that the government will continue to hire hotel for many year to come despite the broken contract the minister say that she want to minimise the effect on the oda budget but how much of it will remain understand that ahead of the reduction that be announce be currently spend on housing asylum seeker in this country clearly if we can get the system run fast from start to finish and we can get people through it fast we can reduce those cost this government inherit chaotic and broken system and disorder at the border under the last conservative government the local community be deprive of manor house in my constituency because it be use as an asylum hotel can the minister confirm that it be the hard yard mission of this government to close those hotel and give they back to their community yes that be our aim appreciate that the minister curt response suggest that she be struggle somewhat with her brief but do she actually know how many gang have be smash if she do not know and on the basis of her previous answer to suspect that she do not why do she not know and if she do know will she inform the house unless of course the answer be that no gang have yet be smash thank the hon gentleman for his belief in my ability to get on top of my brief the national crime agency recently arrest three man in the uk who be want in belgium after be convict of be member of an afghan organise crime group it have arrest turkish national suspect of be one of the most significant supplier of boat and engine to gang who be detain in amsterdam follow joint operation involve the nca and belgian and dutch police there have be conviction of two man base in south wales who run people smuggle ring that involve move thousand of migrant through iran iraq and syria and across europe as result of major international operation involve the nca target syrian organise crime group consider to be one of europe most significant people smuggle gang at least people be arrest in series of raid across the continent include one in the united kingdom that be just what have be happen recently great deal more work be go on involve many many investigation the fruit of which will be bear and we will talk about it when it be deliver commend the work that the government have undertake with european country and other to smash the criminal smuggler gang such as the french deployment of specialist unit on the beach german raid on small boat warehouse and indeed the effort of my right hon friend the home secretary in iraq and in respect of the kurdistan regional government in iraq can the minister confirm that although we will not smash the gang overnight the government remain committed to work with our international partner to secure our border we be do that work day in day out if the conservatives have not allow smuggling gang to take hold across the channel for six year we would not be experience the difficulty that we be experience now in deal with they interruption this take time there be no simple easy solution and chuntere about it from the opposition front bench which let we face it be where the conservatives belong will not make any difference in the first nine month of this government we have witness the cruel impact of their decision making on farmer pensioner and waspi woman people who have work all their life while taxpayer money continue to fund hotel accommodation for economic migrant arrive illegally via the channel my constituent want to see the government put british citizen first rather than prioritise spending on those who be arrive illegally what can the minister say to they today it be important in order to deal with the chaos that we inherit to create system that be fast fair and much easy to get through than the one we inherit unless the hon lady want people to be destitute on the street we have to look after they while we be process their asylum claim speed be important as well as ensure that we do that processing fairly thank the minister and her colleague in the department for the work that they be do to tackle illegal immigration especially the enforcement against the gang who put vulnerable life at risk my constituent want illegal immigration stop and the chaotic huffing and puffing from the conservatives be one of the reason they be boot out on this issue at the general election it be important to restore faith in politic that we deliver on it do the minister believe that the exist legal framework on asylum and return will allow we to do so the prime minister have make it clear that the answer will not be to ignore international law so we have to ensure that we create system that be fast and fair and do the job much more effectively than the one we inherit we be look into how we can make change to ensure that that happen everyone agree that we must have sensible immigration policy but do the minister agree that phrase such as stop the boat and smash the gang be just populist sloganeer that dehumanise the most vulnerable in society and serve as scapegoat for successive government shortcoming include the million spend on the useless rwanda scheme the billion waste on personal protective equipment and the lack of investment in the nhs that be the reason why people can not obtain appointment with their gps not people arrive on boat do the minister agree that we must take holistic approach include perhaps open up safe route and efficient processing so that when people arrive in this country they can start work from day one do not think that safe route would stop people try to get into this country clandestinely it be important that we can assert control at the border so that we decide who come into our country not the people smuggle gang when speak to my constituent they accept that the last government overspent by billion on the asylum system and it fall to this government to make the difficult decision to settle the bill what they can not accept be that it be fair for taxpayer to continue to be expect to spend million day on asylum hotel that be mark of shame for the last government and it may become one for we unless it be resolve what step will the minister take to speed up processing increase return and end the use of hotel for good we have restart asylum processing and we be look into what we can do to speed up the appeal backlog that we inherit we will create system that be fast firm and fair so that we can get people out of asylum hotel which be not sustainable model for the future thank the minister for her answer to the question that other have pose there be clear difference between asylum seeker those flee persecution those who be threaten and economic migrant how can the government gain control of accommodation for those who be economic migrant to reduce this horrific bill in my constituency as in other people be sleep on floor in the home of family member because the housing executive that have responsibility back home can not cope with demand how will the minister and the government ensure that family and child be house whether they be asylum seeker or british citizen my right hon friend the deputy prime minister make some announcement recently about the capacity to increase house building in this country in order to deal with some of the pressure on demand it be important from an asylum seeker point of view that we make the system work end to end much fast so that we can get people through it deport those who have no right to be here and integrate those who have be accept as asylum seeker point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker the head of dover port health authority have tell the house that if funding be not secure for the new financial year food security check at the border will be stop on february ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs to confirm that funding he do not answer and have not respond to my two write parliamentary question on the subject we be now more than two week past the deadline for response and day away from the new financial year with no answer to the question of whether those important check at our border will continue may please have your guidance madam deputy speaker on how we can secure prompt and accurate response from the secretary of state before the check for diseased meat in particular be stop be not sure whether the chair be alert to that point of order it be always good to give prior notice on the exact language the right hon member will know that that be not matter for the chair but she have put her point on the record no doubt those on the treasury bench will have hear it and will pass on her view bill presented arm length bodies accountability to parliament bill presentation and first reading standing order no sir christopher chope present bill to make provision for arm length body to be directly accountable to parliament bill read the first time to be read second time on friday march and to be print bill regulator growth objective motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to provide for the inclusion of economic growth as an objective for certain statutory regulator and for connected purpose for too long our regulatory system have be tangle inefficient and disconnected from the mission of economic growth and prosperity instead of foster investment encourage innovation and deliver good job regulation have too often act as brake on progress too slow too risk averse and too unpredictable the previous government hide behind regulator defer decision create unnecessary bureaucracy and allow inefficiency to flourish too many business today face an overlapping complex regulatory environment with too many regulator too many conflict duty and too little co ordination it be system that frustrate ambition and slow down investment this government be determined to change that under the leadership of the prime minister the chancellor and the business secretary the government be commit to smart regulation regulation that be pro growth pro innovation and yes pro worker we recognise that regulation when design and implement well be not an obstacle but tool it be tool to unlock private investment tackle systemic risk protect the environment and deliver well outcome for people and community britain business large and small be ready to drive economic growth but they can only do so if the regulatory system enable they there be now more than regulatory body many with overlap mandate and responsibility the key regulator the prime minister write to in december collectively employ staff and spend billion year that be significant national investment but one that too often lack strategic co ordination instead of work together many regulator operate in silos duplicate work slow decision and create unnecessary cost and confusion for business their power and duty have expand over time without any overarching framework to keep they align the result be fragmented sometimes contradictory system that no long serve our national economic interest clear example be the payment systems regulator firm operate payment system like mastercard or faster payments be force to engage with three different regulator just to function in the uk that mean three set of rule three set of process and three set of conversation to deliver just one service for major firm it be frustrating for small or scale business it be serious obstacle that be why the prime minister announce its abolition with its core responsibility to be fold into the financial conduct authority this be not about deregulation for deregulation sake it be about smart simplification remove duplication reduce cost and create clear point of accountability in short it be about regulate for growth but let we be clear one example be not enough the problem be systemic the entire regulatory landscape need to be review streamline and refocus around share mission of economic growth that be what the regulators growth objective bill would deliver the bill would support the government broad regulate for growth agenda the chancellor and the business secretary have now publish radical new action plan back by business to create more agile investment friendly regulatory environment as part of that work the chancellor secure pledge from regulator that will deliver real tangible change within the next month the cbi rightly call it shift towards more proportionate outcome base regulation this be practical pro growth reform deliver for business support by business but we must be clear that regulation can be both pro growth and pro our other priority too balanced purposeful regulation can support growth and support the environment strengthen public trust and raise living standard take the government new deal for work people opposition members claim that our proposal to raise the minimum wage and end exploitative zero hour contract introduce day one right against unfair dismissal and expand access to sick pay and parental leave be somehow misalign with the government wide approach to regulation but they fail to recognise that for too long the uk have operate with labour market divide between secure well pay job and grow share of insecure low pay work the result be low wage low productivity doom loop our new deal for work people be regulation with purpose make work more secure business more productive and the economy strong these policy be not just good for worker they be good for business too the government be not tear up the regulatory rulebook but rewrite it for new era we can and must learn lesson from home and abroad take japan top runner programme pioneer regulatory approach that set energy efficiency standard base on the well perform product on the market push industry to innovate and improve by combine ambitious target with industrial flexibility it have successfully drive technological advancement and economic growth while also reduce energy consumption or take the push by uk financial regulator to require major bank to open up their customer datum with consent to third party that have help to create globally lead fintech ecosystem with investment in uk fintech soar the bill would force we to ask how we can repeat those success in other sector for too long regulator have be leave without that kind of strategic guidance force to make politically sensitive decision in vacuum that be not fair on they and it be not good for the country the bill give regulator the direction they have be miss it do not ask they to stop do their work it ask they to do it well together and with share focus on create prosperity because when regulation drift so do the economy yet right now there be no formal mechanism to align regulator with the government growth strategy the bill would provide it it enshrine one simple principle regulator must not only regulate for risk they must regulate for growth that mean every regulator must consider the impact of their decision on investment innovation and prosperity and regulator must work together end duplication and align around share national priority growth would become statutory objective not an afterthought this be not theory it be delivery regulation be not confine to the corridor of whitehall its effect be feel in constituency across our nation the bill be call to action for the government to bring forward full review of regulator duty and objective with the ambition of create simple smart framework fit for the modern economy too many of our regulator be operate under patchwork of outdated or overlapping mandate the result be duplication drift and decision that lack co ordination or clarity it be confusing for business inefficient for regulator and barrier to growth that be why today urge the government to go far and begin the work of legislate for core set of statutory duty include growth across the regulatory landscape duty that promote long term growth and investment protect consumer and the environment and embe culture of speed clarity and accountability in decision making and system where regulator remain independent but the expectation place on they be consistent transparent and align with our national priority we will continue to protect what matter safety fairness the environment and public trust however we must also deliver on what move we forward towards innovation economic renewal and growth growth be not luxury it be how we raise living standard improve public service and restore pride in every part of this country let we give regulator clear foundation let we bring forward new legislative framework that reflect the ambition of dynamic pro growth britain let we regulate for growth commend the bill to the house question put and agree to order that luke murphy mr luke charters uma kumaran lola mcevoy chris curtis sonia kumar gregor poynton kanishka narayan mike reader ms polly billington rachel blake and anneliese midgley present the bill luke murphy accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday july and to be print bill national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill consideration of lords message must draw the house attention to the fact that financial privilege be engage by lords amendment and if the house agree to any of those amendment will cause the customary entry waive commons financial privilege to be enter in the journal after clause exemptions from the change make by section nhs and social care beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to consider the government motion to disagree with lords amendment and welcome the opportunity to consider the new lords amendment to the national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill start by repeat my thank to member of both houses for their careful scrutiny and consideration of the bill four new amendment have be make during consideration of the bill in the other place which we will seek to address today as remind hon member last week when we enter government we inherit fiscal situation that be completely unsustainable and we have have to take difficult but necessary decision to repair the public finance and rebuild our public service the measure in the bill represent some of the tough of those decision but they along with other measure in the budget have enable we to restore fiscal responsibility and get public service back on their foot the amendment from the other place before we today put at risk the funding that the bill seek to raise let be clear again to support the amendment be to support high borrowing low spending or other tax rise it be with that in mind that turn to the first group of amendment lord amendment and these amendment seek to create power as part of the bill to exempt certain group from the change to employer national insurance rate and threshold in the future include exemption for care provider nhs gp practice nhs commission dentist and pharmacist charitable provider of health and care and those provide hospice care it also include power to exempt business or organisation with few than full time employee from the change to the employer national insurance threshold thank the minister for give way so early in his speech just want to understand very clearly why the government think that the nhs under the banner of nhs england should rightly in my opinion be exempt from national insurance contribution but that other part of the nhs such as gp surgery dentist and hospice care should not as set out during consideration of lords amendment last week and indeed at pretty much every other stage of consideration of the bill the response to the change in employer national insurance contribution that we be undertake as government be in line with what the hon gentleman government do with the health and social care levy in the previous parliament namely provide direct support for public employer mean central government local government and public corporation that be the standard way in which support for employer national insurance contribution change be respond to as have set out the revenue raise from the measure in the bill will play critical role in repair the public finance and rebuild our public service clearly any future change that would exempt certain group from pay national insurance would have cost implication which as have make clear would necessitate high borrowing low spending or alternative revenue raise measure it be for that reason that ask the house to support the government position by disagree to amendment and the commons disagreement to lords amendment debate last week state that the amendment interfere with the public revenue and the commons do not offer any further reason do the minister not think that those we represent would just perhaps prefer to see their tax income generously donate via spending on child hospice rather than spend on an idiotic deal to spend million of pound on the chagos island the right hon gentleman raise the question of hospice during last week debate on amendment from the other place as make clear at the time although hospice do not receive support to meet the change in employer national insurance contribution we greatly value the work they do point to the wide support that the government be give the hospice sector namely the million boost for adult and child hospice to ensure they have the good physical environment for care and the million revenue to support child and young people hospice the right hon gentleman also refer to people give to hospice which be establish as charity of course the government provide support for charity include hospice through the tax regime which be among the most generous in the world with tax relief for charity and their donor worth just over billion for the tax year to april lords amendment would require the government to conduct assessment on the economic and sectoral impact of the bill as we have discuss previously the government have already publish an assessment of this policy in tax information and impact note publish by his majesty revenue and customs that note set out that as result of measure in the bill around employer will see their secondary class national insurance contribution liability decrease and around employer will see it increase around employer will see no change the office for budget responsibility economic and fiscal outlook also set out the expect macroeconomic impact of the change to employer national insurance contribution on employment growth and inflation the government and the obr have therefore already set out the impact of this policy change the information provide be in line with other tax change and the government do not intend to publish further assessment however we will of course continue to monitor the impact of these policy in the usual way hope that right hon and hon member will understand why we be not support these amendment from the other place the measure in the bill will play crucial role in fix the public finance and get public service back on their foot the amendment require information that have already be provide do not recognise other policy the government have in place or most seriously seek to undermine the funding that the bill will secure therefore respectfully propose that this house disagree with these amendment and urge all hon and right hon member to support the government on that disagreement call the shadow minister rise on behalf of the official opposition to support lords amendment and it feel like only last week that we be all here but it be clear that our colleague in the other place feel as strongly as the opposition do about these amendment as they have return they to we with similar aim once again lord amendment and seek to address two of the most serious consequence of the bill that should concern and unite we all that rise in secondary class national insurance could lead to significant reduction in health and social care service include our hospice hit the most vulnerable in our society and could represent complete hammer blow to the future aspiration and very survival of small business throughout the country we all know that the chancellor have an addiction to create fiscal black hole first she use fictional black hole discredit by the office for budget responsibility as an excuse for her manifesto break tax rise this have lead to more black hole only this time they be very real because they be be feel out there in the real economy the bill before we today will create black hole in the finance of hospice gp practice farm fruit shop butcher bakery and business of all shape and size but especially the very small do the shadow minister find it puzzle that the nhs will be exempt from these change yet the many service on which people depend for their health dental service social care and so on will be hit by this rise in national insurance contribution interruption no service will remain unaffected so people will not experience the healthcare that they require it be rare that question come with musical accompaniment but the right hon gentleman mobile ringtone make for great effect none the less his point be the right one which be that whether it be intend or not the rationale for the bill be to the government word public service could say bolster public service if be be generous the fact be that the government be tax public service on which we all rely and he be absolutely right to emphasise that lord amendment and seek to provide the power to exempt from both prong of attack of the chancellor job tax care provider nhs gp practice nhs commission dentist nhs commission pharmacist and charitable provider of health and social care such as hospice and it be hospice specifically that want to speak more about today hospice be there at what for many will be the hard moment of their life they provide vital physical and emotional support to individual who be come towards the final chapter of their life and for their love one in short hospice be there to look after we at our most difficult time so whether through funding charitable donation or legislation they deserve our utmost support to continue in this task however as set out in committee this disastrous job tax will cost hospice up to million next year alone hospice uk have repeatedly warn this government that the bill risk reduction in hospice service which will lead only to even great pressure on nhs palliative care service of the more than hospice across our country around provide care for child these be child who be live with terminal illness many of whom have an all too limited time leave in this world the organisation together for short life estimate that the labour government decision to raise national insurance will add almost million to the annual cost of provide care for seriously ill child and their family let we be clear this will mean that every child hospice in england alone will need to spend an average of more just to maintain service for the child in their care after pay the additional tax that this bill will impose the government can not seriously be demand that staff and volunteer at charitable child hospice the very people who already give their heart and soul to look after sick and die child fundraise their share of million next year alone just to keep their light on and their door open at treasury question on january the chancellor state in response to an excellent question from my lincolnshire colleague my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh that the settlement for hospice announce by the health and social care secretary just before christmas include money to specifically compensate hospice for the national insurance increase that be not correct and be pleased that at least this minister have try to acknowledge that point when visit staff at the much love st barnabas hospice in lincoln which provide excellent palliative care they tell that they be lose year in the debate on assist dying we all agree that we want more palliative care just can not understand the logic of what the government be do make one last appeal to they not to load this extra cost on to hospice my right hon friend have raise that matter at every single opportunity that he have be afford and he be right to stand up not just for st barnabas but for all hospice however have to say that st barnabas hold particular place in the heart of people in lincolnshire know as lincolnshire member of parliament that it have be around for year employ staff and treat more than people across our county every single year the fact that it be go to be hit with cost worth hundred of thousand of pound for no good reason be unacceptable pay tribute to my right hon friend the father of the house for raise that point so consistently hope that the government will listen to he the settlement announce do not compensate st barnabas or any hospice for the damage that the government be do not least because we know that much of this money can not be spend on face down the additional running cost that this tax hike will bring there be million of capital funding which have be set aside for building and equipment although that funding be welcome it will not fill the national insurance blackhole that the chancellor have create for the hospice sector and she should not suggest otherwise today the government have chance to exempt hospice and other key area of our health and social care sector from this tax hike by accept lords amendment and in addition lords amendment seek to provide the power to exempt the small business those with few than full time employee from the propose cut to the threshold at which an employer be require to pay secondary class national insurance the chancellor have speak lot about growth but growth have be consistently downgrade since she take office something that we as conservatives know and that she as socialist do not know be that that be because economic growth can not come from the floor of the house of commons it come from the factory floor and bustle high street shop floor in each of our constituency it come not from state create quango such as gb energy but from individual who have an idea stick it out make it work and see it through it come from people in this country who by seek well life through enterprise create the job and service that make our country strong those small business be be hammer but not just by the national insurance hike in less than year they have already see business rate relief cut from to aspiration penalise with change to business property relief and cripple new red tape through the employment rights bill add staggering billion in additional cost this be potent and damaging combination of cost that many fear will mark the end lord amendment give the government another chance today to change their approach to throw our small business lifeline chance of survival finally while our small business require specific attention make it clear last week that sadly this bill do not discriminate it will hit business group of all type across all sector in all part of our country from charity to cafés from pharmacy to child nursery and special educational need and disability transport we must understand the impact the bill will have that be why lords amendment require the chancellor to carry out review of the impact of the bill on range of sector of our economy within six month of its passing into law urge member to support the amendment tomorrow the chancellor will come to this house to launch her late attempt to reverse as much as possible of the damage of her budget of horror despite the hope and dream of business owner across the country we can be sure that her emergency budget will not include scrap this awful bill it be incumbent on all of we in this place to work to protect and support the most vulnerable in our society and to take decision that drive growth back the people out there who make it happen they be the people who will be hit hard by the bill the government must change course call the liberal democrat spokesperson rise to speak to lords amendment and even before the budget there be rumour that the government be think of introduce hike to national insurance contribution we liberal democrats issue stark warning to the government we challenge they at prime minister question and in question to the deputy prime minister say that if they go ahead and introduce these change social care provider up and down the land would be hit incredibly hard the government can not say that they be not warn we warn they even before they make the announcement in the many long debate that we have have in the chamber since the budget we have consistently make the case that health and care provider should be exempt from this change the government say that they want to make the national health service neighbourhood health service we hear this just an hour ago from the secretary of state for health and social care they also say that they want to take service out of hospital and on to the high street but this tax hammer the very provider of the neighbourhood community service on which the nhs rely it be gps dentist pharmacist hospice and care provider who hold up our community care and prop up our nhs so that it do not fall over government ministers have say on many occasion that they have increase funding to social care but the additional funding announce in the budget be dwarf by the rise in national insurance contribution as other member have highlight the government have say that they have give more funding to hospice but that funding be for capital project there be no point have another hospice building or hospice bed if there be no staff to look after the people lie in they we know that we have to fix the front door to the nhs our gps and dentist but we have to fix the back door to our nhs too which be social care on hospice there be nowhere else for the people in they to go people look for support from hospice so that they can die in dignity with independence in setting of their choice surround by their love one not in the sterile environment of hospital ward or bad busy corridor or ambulance park outside we need our gps dentist hospice pharmacist and care provider to survive and thrive if we be to end the crisis in our nhs the lords in their wisdom have not send back an amendment that simply ask for an exemption they have put in very clever tweak that ask that the government to adopt henry viii power that be not something the liberal democrats would normally support but on this occasion it would give ministers the power to choose if and when they want to exempt health and care provider from the rise that way when we get this enormous growth boom in our economy when we see the success that we all hope to see minister could choose to exempt health and care provider and give they the cash injection that they need urge the government to support this measure amendment provide power to exempt small business from the change small business be the engine of our economy and of growth they be the very organisation that prop up our high street they be the glue that hold our community together the government have raise the employment allowance for microbusinesse but they have not put other provision in place to support small business while our small business can be the engine of growth they be scream out about the number of obligation be put on they with the nic change business rate bill go up and the new obligation under the employment rights bill it be all happen at once and they say that they be overwhelmed support amendment which would give the government the power to exempt small business be also in favour of lords amendment on an impact assessment as ministers remind we there be tax and spend announcement come but look at the impact of the provision this be less about tax and spend and more about the overwhelming impact on small business which be really struggle right now many of they still have covid loan and many be struggle with access to finance many owner be remortgage their home to prop up new business this change have come out of the blue small business have not be able to plan ahead for it and many of they be fearful about what will happen fear that if the measure go ahead in matter of day we will start to see shop front board up on high street up and down the land be go to call sir roger gale but he be no long bob ah call he now thank you madam deputy speaker naively assume that have already be call twice today have to take my place in the pecking order want to come back briefly to hospice this be very serious issue and do not think that the minister or the government understand the deleterious effect of the change on care for some of the sick people in the land both in adult hospice and child hospice have listen very carefully twice now to the minister response about give this and give that but they be give with one hand and take away more with the other the net result will be reduction in staff this be straightforward tax on job without dedicated caring staff who do job that frankly most of we would not begin to know how to do the health service will not function there be child live in and be service by demelza house shooting star and all the other child hospice the pilgrims hospices in thanet and canterbury will not be able to afford to recruit and or pay the staff that they need hospice care be an integral part of the health service the point be make by my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh and other that hospice care be part of the health service and should be treat as part of the nhs interruption my right hon friend ask from sedentary position where be all the labour member the answer be that they will be in the lobby vote against these measure but they be not here listen to the debate it sadden to have to say it but in this instance their absence speak volume quite simply they do not care the lords amendment seek to address clear present and insurmountable financial challenge for significant element of health and social care delivery in all our community the government say in the most spurious and disingenuous way as though they do not understand their role in the health service that social care provider gps dentist and pharmacy be contractor how they be deal with by his majesty revenue and customs be irrelevant it be the role that they fulfil in our society and in the delivery of health and social care service that be at stake these be not contractor that can go and develop new market somewhere else their market be exclusively within the nhs and health and social care up and down these island many properly commercial business will not manage to pivot their way out of this attack from labour and gp practice pharmacy care provider nursery and hospice certainly will not want to mention hospice when macmillan cancer support speak no matter what colour our rosette we should listen it have highlight clearly what the measure mean for end of life care there have be year of chaos in the united kingdom most of it economic there have be the lost decade of brexit and its catastrophic effect on the uk economy and the material welfare of people up and down these island ask who can we blame who be culpable who have their fingerprint all over it not terminally ill child in hospice who will as result of the bill suffer as result of the debilitate effect on the care with which they be provide the minister and his government could do simple thing give hospice derogation from the grasp hand of the bill and protect child in the bad imaginable circumstance from the outset the government fiscal misadventure have be meet with opprobrium from all manner of section of the economy and society but they have hold firm pay tribute to the minister he front up here every time with smile and do his good to defend what he have to that be his job and do not judge he for that but the bottom line be that the government have yield not to child in hospital or to people try to deliver social care and free up hospital bed by prevent delay discharge but to the banker by restore their bonus and to the non dom who want all the benefit of live in this country but do not want to pay for it that speak volume about what labour government in this day and age be all about hope that can have this intervention without musical interlude apologise to you madam deputy speaker for have my phone switch on will the hon member accept that not only be service likely to be affect as he have outline but the government aim of raise additional revenue will be affect as well as he point out they have give in to the banker and non dom because of the fear of lose revenue anecdotally we know that many business whether those support the national health service or other small business will cut back on the number of staff that they employ because they can not afford they and that will lead to loss of national insurance and tax contribution it could be an own goal for the government if they cause pain to business but do not get any revenue from it agree entirely this be billion fiscal drag that be intend to create growth work that one out if you can because it be beyond my ken the government will not make derogation for key element of health and social care because the benefit of the billion drag on the economy that the right hon gentleman point out be after compensation already down billion if they compensate the people who they definitely should such as gps pharmacy care provider and hospice that would take it down to somewhere around billion or billion what type of chancellor and treasury orthodoxy say we place billion burden on the economy in exchange for an billion return for the treasury it be absolutely catastrophic it be misadventure writ large and it have labour as its logo the hon member highlight the comment by the office for budget responsibility which say that the billion be in fact only billion once behaviour change be account for if the government be to agree to the exemption that we seek the figure could be only billion do he agree that there be much fairer way of raise that revenue such as by put digital service tax on the big online medium giant and gaming company the hon member raise two excellent example of what could be do to raise the funding that the government need in just way let we not forget that labour know fine what it be walk into when it win the election we tell it as do the liberal democrats and the medium the tories be bit quiet on the issue right enough that there would be an billion black hole if it stick to tory tax and spending policy this be on labour the hon member mention two example of excellent and just way to raise funding similarly the government could apply scottish income tax threshold to the whole of the uk give most people pay rise and raise billion into the bargain they could raise billion from wealth tax on asset over million there be range of other measure that they could take such as raise billion by rejoin the single market not very many people in here talk about that the government persist in their tendentious reference to additional funding all of which be capital and none of which can soften the blow of the measure contain in the bill they do not want to support in particular lords amendment because they would rather continue to cloak the effect that the bill will have on care service and contractor element of the national health service up and down these island and the effect that it will have on the real economy which labour be stranger to be just flummox by the government approach to the bill clause raise employer national insurance from to almost more damagingly clause reduce the threshold at which they start pay it from to just the government know how damaging this measure be for healthcare we can see that because they have take action to exempt the nhs from it that will cost billion of pound because healthcare provider can not just diversify as other section of the economy might be able to they can not raise price general practitioner customer be the state and price be fix by the treasury as result the government know exactly what the impact of this proposal will be on hospice we have already hear that without an exemption they will face an additional million of cost every year as result of these change when the bill be first announce assume that there have be an oversight by the treasury and that it would be address as the bill progress but both last week and this week the lords have move to fix what be originally consider to be perhaps an oversight today decision to seek to reverse lords amendment and in particular demonstrate beyond doubt that it be not an oversight but deliberate decision take by labour to penalise hospice for the care of the dying and to do what with that money we may be in the obscene position in few week time of funding for state assist dying be raise by tax palliative care this be absolute madness if member want any other reason why they should not support the government that be an overwhelming one make one last reference to the emptiness of the government benches there be now two labour members sit there who be not require to take it back there be only one that indicate to that labour members do not want to be associate with the bill they will scurry through the lobby later but they be not brave enough to stand up and defend the decision of their government you do not need any convincing of this madam deputy speaker but be you to the lords amendment demonstrate why we need house of lords they be the one stand up and deliver the amendment that this government be try to wriggle out of this afternoon amendment and which the government be try to derogate from be essential for our care service the financial strain that the government national insurance contribution will put on the care sector be astronomical some prediction be of around billion on social care alone ultimately that will lead to reduction in service and unfortunately closure especially in the hospice sector the minister have repeat what he and other ministers have say on many occasion they be give certain amount of money to the hospice sector but as opposition colleague have state that be capital spending what they desperately need be revenue spending to cover the cost of the rise in national insurance contribution be the hon gentleman concern that the government patently do not understand whole system cost which be key element of fiscal policy when care provider whether hospice in home care provider or social provider fall over as result of these measure as they will those cost will get pick up by the rest of the system and that will have net cost to the treasury the hon gentleman make an excellent point which have be make by opposition members on numerous occasion it do not surprise that labour member do not understand the economy do hope that they would understand the care sector which have be tell they time and again that this national insurance increase will hit it disproportionately and cause it to reduce and indeed close service think of phyllis tuckwell hospice in the centre of farnham in my constituency which be fortunately go through multimillion pound rebuild as we speak but when it reopen it will be hit by these national insurance contribution and will have to make decision about what service it can provide to my constituency and the surround area of surrey and northern hampshire likewise on friday will see shooting star child hospice which be fabulous child hospice that have visit on number of occasion what be gall to be that see photograph of labour members turn up to shooting star and similar hospice put their arm around people and say what wonderful job they be do but later today they will walk through the division lobby to take money away from they what hypocrisy we already know that there be workforce challenge in the care sector and especially in the hospice sector so why on earth be the government target those sector for raise national insurance contribution as opposition members have mention this be not an abstract cost that will hit some sort of nebulous business this be cost that will hit patient and in the hospice sector those who be die because care will be take from they it be tax on community care it be tax on die the labour government should be ashamed that they be bring this in we have rightly concentrate great deal on child hospice and still hope that at the hour the government as socialist government may have some compassion and give some ground but the other area which we have not touch on enough be the independent care provider who be provide service in people home they will not be able to employ the people that they need they can not do so now even if they can get they that inevitably mean that those care for will end up in hospital at still great cost to the health service my right hon friend make an excellent point echo one make by the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan that be correct there will inevitably be net cost to the exchequer because of this policy he be right that home care have not be touch on but will be affect home care company in my constituency will not be able to expand their staff which be vital to meet people need pharmacy which we have not touch on lot be in the same position few week back visit badgerswood pharmacy in headley in my constituency and be tell that the measure will hit it hard and cause real problem in service delivery for my constituent this measure will not only have massive effect on those business gps pharmacy the hospice sector and the home care sector on the economy because there will be net cost and on patient who will not receive the service in the wide nhs family that they deserve but it run entirely contrary to the government state policy of want to bring healthcare close to home and close to the community although they be exempt acute hospital care which take place away from the community they be tax the bit that they say they want to expand it be totally illogical even on the government own policy hope that the government have an hour change of heart either today or at the emergency budget tomorrow because it be vital that we support these sector we see with lords amendment that the proof of the pudding be in the eating as it be if the government be so convinced that their policy be the right just fair and proper one they would allow review to go ahead so that we could see its impact the fact that government members will be walk through the division lobby to hide this policy from the british people tell we all that we need to know they know that this policy do not stand up to scrutiny and they be run from it with the leave of the house will respond briefly to some of the comment make by opposition members although feel that the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for st albans daisy cooper will not support we on the bill none the less recognise that she seem to support the extra funding that we put into public service in term of gps dentist hospice commission by the nhs and so on although she will not agree with the difficult decision that we have take to raise that funding get the impression that she support our spending on those public service turn to the official opposition the shadow minister the hon member for grantham and bourne gareth davies claim that very small business will feel the great impact from the change in the bill can only conclude therefore that he have not read the bill because he would have see that we be double the employment allowance to with the result that the very small business will not pay any national insurance contribution at all when they be employ up to four people earn the national living wage more widely the shadow minister and many of his opposition colleague refuse to take any responsibility whatever for the state of the public finance or the public service after year of the conservative party be in control they also resist the opportunity to acknowledge that the approach we be take in government to compensate the public sector for change in employer national insurance contribution be the same one that the previous government take with the health and social care levy that come up time and again and even when the shadow minister be intervene on he miss the opportunity to acknowledge that our approach be the same one that he and his colleague take in government the amendment from the other place would require information that have already be provide either they do not recognise other policy that the government have in place or most seriously they would undermine the funding that the bill will secure let be clear to support the amendment that create exemption be also to support high borrowing low spending or other tax rise therefore ask the house to support the government position by disagree to lords amendment and question put that this house disagree with lords amendment jack abbott zubir ahmed douglas alexander sadik al hassan tahir ali rosena allin khan callum anderson fleur

consideration of lords amendment must draw the house attention to the fact that financial privilege be engage by lords amendment to and to if any of those lords amendment be agree to will cause the customary entry waive commons financial privilege to be enter in the journal clause application of multiplier beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss lords amendment to and government motion to disagree first be grateful to member of both the commons and the lords who have so diligently scrutinise the bill throughout its passage before address the amendment table by the lords allow to remind the house of why we introduce the bill in the first place this government have commit to transform the business rate system and the bill be first step on that important journey we want to achieve sustainable system that be fit for the current economic landscape and where business growth be support and ratepayer pay their fair share thank the noble lord khan of burnley for take the bill through the other place and for be so thorough in his approach also thank officer of the ministry of housing communities and local government and my private office for all their work on the bill the government oppose all the amendment before we today and will provide further explanation as to why at the budget the government explain that we want to introduce new low multiplier for qualify retail hospitality and leisure property from april to address the uncertainty of the temporary stopgap support provide by the annual rhl relief business rate represent stable source of revenue for local government mean that this permanent tax cut must be sustainably fund that be why the government also announce our intention to introduce high multipli for all property with rateable value at or above this bill make provision to enable the introduction of those new multiplier so this be the first step towards deliver on the government manifesto commitment to transform the business rate system to one that be sustainable protect the high street and be fit for the century on point of detail the minister say the bill be first step so will there be further reform follow these reform to the rest of the business rate system to meet his manifesto commitment to replace the current business rate system completely be not go to pre empt any further decision on this other than to say that this represent an important and significant step forward as constituency mp he like will have hear from many small business retailer hospitality provider or leisure provider who appreciate the support during covid but be very clear that there be cliff edge and that that support be come to an end the previous government do not provide any certainty about what follow so the bill end that uncertainty and hardwire in permanent relief system to ensure those important business that be the foundation of our community and our economy be support through the tax system the minister have already say as he have in previous speech that this be first step but now he say it be permanent measure agree with he that business want certainty so it be important that business understand be this now permanent position that will not be change or first step the answer be that it be both as will go on to explain in more detail it be an important first step and the relief that be provide fund through the high rate property will be hard baked into the system notwithstanding any future support that may well follow which we be not pre empte today lord amendment and would remove qualifying healthcare hereditament from the high multipli and lords amendment and would do the same in relate to anchor store consider the challenging fiscal environment it be vital that this permanent tax cut be fund sustainably the government have be clear that they will do that by apply the high multipli to all property with rateable value at or above that account for less than of all property and be the fair approach the impact on healthcare property be limited as set out in the other place of the property at or above the threshold base on the current rating list and round to only be in the health sub sector of those be nhs hospital and only be doctor surgery or health centre at the autumn budget the chancellor fix the spending envelope for phase of the spending review the government be consider the full range of departmental priority and pressure as part of the spending review and that include any impact of the high multipli on public sector property such as school and hospital urge the house to disagree with those amendment we recognise the importance of anchor store and we be do great deal to support the high street in this bill and elsewhere while the large anchor store may be catch by the high multipli they be often part of large retail chain that will have number of property with rateable value below those business will therefore benefit overall from the low multiplier appreciate the point that the minister be make in fareham and waterlooville we have some fantastic pub include the golden lion in fareham the chairmaker in denmead and the heroes in waterlooville many pub be hub of our community and make valid contribution to the local economy but they have be trade under challenge circumstance and have be ask for cut in business rate what will be the effect of the minister position today the bill provide cash saving for exactly the type of business that the right hon member talk about we all understand the importance of pub to our town village and estate not just as business in the economy but as place for the community to convene to meet and to build relationship and network that be exactly why the measure be be bring in and in permanent way because pub need certainty they know the rise cost of supply carbon dioxide and energy have put significant pressure on pub operation and these measure provide long term stability that bake in the support the government can offer into the system many pub will be free house and they will be independent however number of pub will be part of brewery chain with manager in place the measure take away the cash cap of per business allow for the first time multiple operator to benefit that will benefit pub chain as well as high street store such as home bargains boot and other retailer those business draw in footfall which then support independent retailer as well the proposal be rounded and provide long term stability that be properly fund in responsible way on that basis the government oppose the lords amendment as lay out lord amendment and be concern with bring manufacturing property into scope of the low multipli if we widen the scope of the low multiplier in that way it will dilute the support available to rhl property or jeopardise the ability of the government to sustainably fund the low multiplier we need to be clear that this be not wide range offer but target deliberately at support our community high street and town centre that be why the bill focus on rhl support the government be support the manufacture sector through other mean for those reason urge the house to oppose the amendment lord amendment and require the government to undertake review of how the provision to introduce new multiplier may affect business whose rateable value be close to the threshold for the high multipli the review would need to be put before parliament three month prior to april in order for clause to of this bill to come into effect these amendment probe around the way the multiplier in the business rate system currently operate those hereditament on the standard multipli or in the future on the high multiplier pay rate on that multiplier calculate on all of their rateable value and not just the rateable value above the threshold that of course generate cliff edge in the rate bill for hereditament as they move between threshold and we acknowledge the presence of those cliff edge it be matter of fact at the autumn budget the treasury launch discussion with business on the transforming business rates paper this specifically highlight these cliff edge in the system and consider whether they may act as disincentive to expand so can assure the house that we be already look at the precise issue identify in the amendment reform be be take forward through the transforming business rate work and will be phase in over the course of the parliament therefore we believe lords amendment and be unnecessary lords amendment would require the government to commence review that examine the merit of create within three month of royal assent separate use class and associate multiplier within the non domestic rating for retail service provide by fulfilment warehouse in england that do not have material presence on high street the noble lord thurlow who put forward the amendment make it clear that this use class would apply only to business rate as he explain in the other place the key task be to identify those warehouse as distinct from warehouse use by say high street retailer warehouse that may otherwise look the same the lords amendment would bring together the government and professional body work on business rate to identify those warehouse we be already explore that objective through an exist project the digitalising business rate project will allow we to match property level datum with business level datum from his majesty revenue and customs to improve the way in which we target business rate and to identify property and business in the way that the lords amendment envisage do not intend to intervene but be look through the amendment and see that lot of they focus on exemption from the business rate do the minister agree that the way to look at support business in for example the manufacturing industry be through other mean not through change the business rate we welcome scrutiny through amendment and the insight that the other place can provide just as we welcome scrutiny in the evidence session and committee sitting it add value we need to be honest it be natural for member to want to widen the scope of legislation during its passage and to include more in government we have to deal with the art of the possible which mean balance number of compete interest not least the impact on taxpayer in the round the bill be target at those who need it the most community and local economy and it be fully fund to ensure that it be sustainable we can not draw the legislation so wide that it do not stand the test of time and do not cover its own cost that would not be responsible and certainly would not be sustainable lords amendment would require the government to implement the recommendation of the review give that we do not know what those recommendation would be trust the house will understand that we can not accept an amendment to accept they blindly in advance finally lords amendment and consequential lords amendment to would strike from the bill the clause that remove charitable rate relief from private school that be charity we be unable to accept these lords amendment this government make manifesto commitment to raise school standard for every child break down barrier to opportunity and ensure that every child have the good start in life no matter where they come from or their financial background achieve our ambition involve meet our commitment to remove the vat and business rate charitable relief tax break for private school the approach and design of this policy have be carefully consider in the light of that the measure be necessary in order to raise the revenue to deliver on the government commitment to education and young people and to improve the state sector where let we be of child be educate this government be prepared to take the tough but necessary decision to deliver on those bold commitment so as with all the other amendment bring here from the other place can not accept these lords amendment hope that the rest of the house follow suit call the shadow secretary of state thank the minister for his explanation of the lords amendment we shall not agree and will explain why thank the lords for their careful consideration of the bill in particular thank the noble lord jamieson and the noble baroness scott for their scrutiny and amendment the legislation come at critical time for business the partial withdrawal of retail hospitality and leisure relief policy choice by this government be hit business hard the average pub be more than bad off as result of the minister choice that together with the government trash talk of the economy the billion annual tax rise for business by mean of the rise in employer national insurance and the prospect of the job destroy employment rights bill have lead directly to massive reduction in business confidence accord to the institute of directors business confidence which stand at high of plus in july last year have collapse to covid level low of minus my hon friend be make very good speech what be his advice to the many business in fareham and waterlooville who have tell have lose count of they that they do not know whether they will survive the next few year particularly because of the rise in national insurance contribution from employer the employment rights bill and the anti business rhetoric hire be down price be up and many business in fareham and waterlooville be begin to wonder whether it be all worth it my right hon and learn friend make very good point these be difficult time as she know be in business for year and we go through some difficult time many people think that business be easy but it be not particularly at time like this when confidence include consumer confidence have go so low it mean that people be not come through the door my advice to business be to batten down the hatch and get through this where they can but inevitably the consequence of these choice will be less employment low salary increase and high price in shop public house and other place that be the consequence of the choice that this government have make the real world effect of this historic drop in confidence be year high in business closure over business close their door in the last three month of when consider the lords amendment it be important to remember that the labour party promise to abolish business rate another broken promise the minister for whom have great deal of time talk about the art of the possible what he be say be that promise that he and his colleague make to the electorate in the run up to the election have be break in its manifesto labour promise to replace the business rate system so we can raise the same revenue but in fair way this new system will level the play field between the high street and online giant that be not what the bill do so that be also broken promise the reason challenge the minister couple of time during his remark be that do not understand how the bill can be both first step and permanent change that make no sense and if be one of the business people for whose rude health we be all responsible would like to know exactly what the government have plan beyond these change that be not clear turn first to lords amendment which would require the secretary of state to review the merit of separate use class and associate multiplier for retail service provide by fulfilment warehouse that do not have material presence on local high street in other word online giant it be worth note that the rate regime propose by this bill will mean that only around of business pay the high rate will be the warehouse of online giant in reality shop restaurant cafés pub cinema music venue gym and hotel will all see their business rate rise as result of the high multipli we would support rate regime that would genuinely level the play field between online retailer and the high street but this bill do not deliver that we therefore support amendment requirement that the secretary of state conduct review on introduce high multipli for fulfilment warehouse such multipli would mean that important anchor store for high street would not be punish that bring to lords amendment and we all know from our constituency how important anchor store such as supermarket and department store be for attract footfall and support local economy when people come into the town centre to use an anchor store they might stop for lunch in local café or pop into an independent business key anchor store in the secretary of state constituency will be hit by this bill sainsbury in ashton under lyne have rateable value of million while marks and spencer next door have rateable value of these decision have real world effect on company that be not online giant we have see the impact on our community when anchor store leave town for many anchor store be drag into the high multipli by this bill could be the straw that break the camel back those shop have already be hit by the job tax and will be tie up with even more red tape through the employment rights bill in fact the british retail consortium have warn the government that the sheer scale of new cost and the speed with which they occur create cumulative burden that will make job loss inevitable and high price certainty that contrast with my party proud record of support business include small business on the high street by cut business rate as well as provide billion of pound of support throughout the pandemic while we be talk about high street business can once again push the minister on very important point the retention of small business rate relief many business livelihood depend on that relief so will he say at the dispatch box that it will be continue have not have clarity and clearly will not get clarity today be that relief also on the chop block maybe at the chancellor emergency budget tomorrow let we see what that bring we may get clear answer then tomorrow last gasp attempt to go for growth come after gdp fall by in january that be largely attribute to fall in manufacture output that bring briefly to lords amendment and they would make manufacturing hereditament eligible for the low multiplier when it come to local rating list that come at particularly important time for our manufacturing sector which be crucial part of our economy whether we be talk about automotive manufacturing aerospace manufacturing or precision engineering as we boost capital defence expenditure it be important that we have strong and resilient manufacturing base that can supply our brave armed force urge the government to reflect carefully on the impact of the new rate system on manufacturing and we will listen carefully to the minister response on this issue turn to lords amendment and give that the government be raise taxis to invest in the nhs it seem perverse for they to levy high business rate on the hospital and gp practice that provide the service that so many of our constituent rely on it be just week since the government shamefully vote to impose job tax on hospice pharmacy and gp practice another double whammy labour be give with one hand and take with the other before we get to the real sting in the tail of this bill will speak briefly to lords amendment and like member of the other house we have concern about the cliff edge that the bill will create in the business rate system which the minister refer to business cross the threshold even by could see near increase in rate payable for instance business with hereditament of invest in their property just enough to push they over the threshold would potentially see an increase in rate from around to as result of this bill the legislation will stifle investment and growth even far finally labour education tax the spiteful and ideologically drive decision to remove the charitable rate relief from private school that be charity sit alongside the utterly wrong head policy of charge vat on private school fee regardless of people view on private school it be the view of the opposition that we should never tax education we be already see the gate of independent school be lock indefinitely that push more child into state education increase class size and put more pressure on the public purse and on council try to find placement for student with education health and care plan lord amendment would retain rate relief for private school in england spar they part of cumulative burden that would otherwise send many of they beyond the brink it be not just education that be affect since the introduction of this bill we have learn that the government will also levy business rate on nursery school and sport facility use by the general public if they be on the site of private school that regressive decision will jack up the cost of swimming lesson and the cost for sunday league club and cadet unit during our time in government england become one of the top perform country for education in the western world that be record that this government seem determined to trash year down the line government members will regret have vote for this bill as they walk down the high street pass board up shop school gate lock shut and local that call last order for the final time year ago urge the government to consider and agree to the amendment from the lords to safeguard business school and community across the country from more business damage and job destroy tax hike the bill be necessary to support our high street it strike fair balance between small business and large and be pleased to have contribute during most stage of its progress rise to address some of the amendment put forward by the other place which would reduce the effectiveness of the bill amendment and seek to exempt anchor store from the high multiplier thus reduce the revenue raise by the bill overall by reduce that revenue the amendment reduce the support available to small retail hospitality and leisure business when provide that support be the entire purpose of this legislation also fear that the definition of an anchor store could create problem for our high street and town centre during the debate in the other place it be say that the treasury could decide what constitute an anchor store but it be also admit that it would be difficult term to define it be not uncommon and not untrue to say that several shop in high street can indeed lay claim to that title and foresee difficulty in this regard if the amendment be pass it be also true that anchor store be often the large store in town usually part of big chain supermarket be an obvious example the effect of this amendment would be to exempt those large business from the high multipli again reduce the support available to small business the entire purpose of the bill be to support our small retail leisure and hospitality business pay for by that high multipli on large business unlike the opposition we like to ensure that our number add up what would the hon gentleman say to business that be try to make their number add up in its manifesto and previously the promise the commitment of the labour party be to level the play field between online giant and small business but as the hon gentleman can see that be not what be happen here many different premise include manufacturer and large brick and mortar retailer be be hit by these increase what would the hon gentleman say to those business give that while there be currently no sign of any increase in their rate that be exactly what they will see as result of the bill the bill be design specifically to revive our high street the hon gentleman will remember because his party be in government at the time that our high street be struggle and suffocate and it be incumbent on this new government to revive they that be why it be so important for we to pass the bill today interruption the hon gentleman mention manufacturing and his hon friend the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew chirp from sedentary mean chunter think it important to recognise that the government be support manufacture too there be other mechanism for do that but the bill we be pursue today and pass today be all about support our high street and be very proud to support it queen street be in morley in the centre of my constituency you be welcome to visit it any time madam deputy speaker there be lot on offer almost of all of which come directly from small business the lords amendment to which have refer do not prioritise they nor do they prioritise the small parade of shop in farnley drighlington gildersome and wortley and they do nothing for the shop and business in ardsley tingley robin hood and lofthouse that be why can not support they back the business in morley high street along with all the other small business that represent lord amendment and would in effect reintroduce the tax break for private school we have have this argument about private school at the general election in the house in bill committees and again today but as former math teacher at state school in leeds be more than happy to cover old ground to reinforce my own argument the propose amendment seek to remove an integral part of the bill that generate the revenue that we need to support our plan in government will make no apology for support the of child who attend state school we all and include everyone in the house want child to have the good opportunity in life with the high quality teaching and school to match it should be basic function of the state to provide well fund excellent state school place for all student whether their parent choose to take advantage of that or not on the labour benches as we have prove over recent month we be prepared to take the action necessary to ensure that all child can access through the state the education they deserve the million raise by the measure in the bill alongside the other revenue raise measure we have take in the budget will result and do result in real term increase in per pupil funding for the who attend our state school be very proud to support that we will never make any apology for properly fund state school by end the tax break that be previously enjoy by private institution that be why will not be vote for the amendment to conclude be pleased to support the bill in its current unamended form will support our high street it will give confidence to small business and it will give state school the funding they desperately need call the liberal democrat spokesperson too begin by put on record my thank to the noble lords in the other place for all their work on the bill in particular those on the liberal democrat benches baroness pinnock lord shipley and lord fox business rate reform be long overdue and while we welcome the proposal to permanently reduce business rate for retail hospitality and leisure in the meantime many business across my constituency and indeed the country be reel as they see the impact of the reduction in rate relief in bill land on their doormat have hear from number of business just in the past few day be really concerned about pub restaurant and cafés in my constituency who be wonder how with the national insurance rise and the reduction in rate relief they will continue the liberal democrats would like to see fundamental overhaul of the business rate system not just the stick plaster solution propose in the bill that tinker around the edge as say low business rate for retail hospitality and leisure be step in the right direction but there be countless small business outside those sector that need their tax burden reduce too for example manufacturing business we table amendment on report to improve the bill and to ensure it give consideration to whether there should be provision for manufacturing facility which can be big and build on expensive land but sometimes produce relatively low value good lord amendment seek to do the same whereby manufacturing premise would also pay new low business rate under the bill without that light engineering and printer among other business in our town centre mixed economy could be price out recent report by barclays bank conclude that the word make in britain be worth an additional billion to uk exporter so it be important that something be do to support the manufacturing sector we have learn the hard way in recent year with the pandemic and war that we need to be much more self sufficient as country yet there have be big drop in confidence in the sector since autumn with an increase in manufacturer cost and order in general report to be small in size that come on top of the additional brexit red tape that those business have to contend with to export therefore we support retain this amendment in the bill as have say we want fundamental reform of business rate so we can boost small business and our high street we table an amendment on report to require review of the impact of the bill on business high street and economic growth so we support retain lords amendment which would require the secretary of state to review the impact of the bill on business whose rateable value be close to and so will be catch by the new high business rate turn to our nhs yet again we see the government give with one hand and take with the other as with national insurance contribution so with the business rate change there be unintended but significant consequence for our health service lord amendment seek to exclude hospital and other healthcare setting from pay new high business rate for property with rateable of or more without the amendment local hospital will be catch by the rate an unacceptable new burden when the nhs be already struggle as my noble friend baroness pinnock point out in the other place without the amendment the like of great ormond street hospital for child will have an additional burden of per year on business rate alone the john radcliffe hospital in oxford have potential business rate increase from million to million and the hull royal infirmary could see its bill rise from million to million those be typical figure for hospital across the country do not believe it be the government intention to reduce hospital ability to drive down their waiting list yet that be exactly what the impact of these change and the consequent high charge will be so we support the amendment the bill also levy tax on education by remove the business rate exemption for private school that be charity measure that will be compound by the government move to levy vat on private school fee and the increase to employer national insurance contribution as have say many time since the general election and indeed before the liberal democrats be oppose in principle to the taxation of education as it be public good we strongly support and champion parent right to choose on which both those tax measure be an assault do the hon lady not accept that this government win an election on the basis of promise that we would introduce vat on private school fee so it be incumbent on we to deliver that manifesto pledge be very grateful for that intervention because gently remind the hon gentleman that his party win the election with less than of the vote can not remember what the turnout be but my hon friend tell it be can not do the math quickly enough clearly need to do math to one in five voter one in seven adult there we go basically not many voter vote for labour manifesto will happily let the hon gentleman continue to plough that furrow because have have that argument make to before for instance in the petition debate on vat on private school fee just last week be incredibly grateful to the hon lady for give way again the simple fact be that we have the electoral system we have and it be incumbent on whomever win majority to deliver their manifesto pledge to govern the country she may take issue with the electoral system but it be the one that we have and we must deliver our manifesto pledge respectfully say to the hon gentleman that rise in employer national insurance contribution be not in his party manifesto nor be cut to the winter fuel allowance nor be the farmer tax yet these be all thing labour be implement rise unless the hon gentleman want to make different point from his party manifesto which be not vote for by many people will not give way although will pick up on another point he make early clause which implement the removal of charitable rate relief for private school undermine the principle that refer to we should not be tax education and we should respect parent right to choose the clause will undermine the ability of independent school to undertake the brilliant partnership work that they do in our community and with state school have talk many time in this place of lady eleanor holles and hampton school in my constituency which have do amazing work with underprivileged community in the feltham area such as with reach academy and help to transform the life chance and outcome for young people in that community the measure will also limit those school ability to extend bursary to child from more disadvantaged background the hon lady be absolutely right in what she be say on private school and agree with everything she have say on that point do she agree that as well as the damaging effect on child who go to private school this will affect child in state school in hampshire thousand of young pupil attend independent school but the state school be run at nearly capacity this measure be go to push hundred if not thousand of child into state school which be already full thereby harm and undermine the education of all child be that not unforgivable thank the right hon lady for her intervention be aware from talk to colleague that there be real pressure on school place in different part of the country clearly that be where we will see negative impact in my own constituency and indeed across london we be struggle with secondary school place although roll be fall in primary school which will feed into the secondary sector these pressure of child leave the private sector to go into the state sector be different in different part of the country take together the removal of the business rate exemption for school that be charity and the levying of vat on school will perversely serve only to make independent school more elitist and less accessible to many family up and down the country which seem to be at odd with what this labour government purport to stand for be perplex as to why ministers be so keen to push through these measure just last week they march their labour mps through the no lobby when the liberal democrats seek to impose profit cap on the shameless profiteering of private equity run special school which be bankrupt our local authority many vulnerable child be miss out on the support that they need because of the behaviour of some of these company yet the labour government will not take action on they they be none the less happy to tax parent and take away rate relief from those school operate as charity before come to close let address the point make by the hon member for leeds south west and morley mark sewards he say how all of this money raise from business rate exemption and vat on private school would help fund the state sector may gently point out to he that it be his education secretary who before christmas write to the school teachers review body essentially to say that teacher should be give pay rise that be high than the extra funding that our state school will receive in the come financial year and that have be confirm by datum release by the education department this week as result many state school across the country which be already feel the pinch will have shortfall in fund school in my constituency already run amazon wish list for thing such as glue stick whiteboard marker and tissue box they be rely on parent teacher associations to buy new furniture our state school be already struggle but the money that the hon member say will be raise will not go to they they will not be fund sufficiently therefore this nirvana of state school that he claim we will have simply do not exist the hon member have be very generous with her time on the point that she make about fund for state school and about the other difficult decision that this government have have to make do she not accept that when we come to power we find an economy that have be absolutely ruin by the conservative party we find every department in reserve and billion black hole that have to be fill because we be the party of economic responsibility thank the hon member for his intervention where we can make common cause be over the absolute mess in which the conservatives leave both our public service and our economy have no quibble in agree with he on that point we liberal democrats set out whole series of tax measure actually we be the only party that be not afraid to put forward revenue raise measure but his government be choose not to accept any of they they include tax our big tech giant that be ruin the mental health of our child and young yes in fact they be plan to slash that tax altogether we also suggest reverse the tax cut that the conservatives give to the big bank so that we can continue put free school meal on the table for child which again his government be think of cut then we suggest reform capital gain tax order remind the hon lady that we be in fact debate lords amendment and the government motion to disagree apologise madam deputy speaker be simply seek to address the hon member point be come in to land now time and again we see government policy at odd with their state objective they want to tackle nhs waiting list but then slap business rate on to large hospital and put national insurance rise on to our gps hospice and social care provider they claim to drive growth but then slap business rate on to much need manufacturing and put cliff edge on small business in our town centre they want to extend opportunity to all but then go after charitable independent school that be serve their wide community not to mention punish parent who dare to make that choice for their child amid some good intention the government have lose their way in part of the bill implore minister to genuinely consider the amendment before they in order to support our hospital and allow business up and down our country to grow and flourish question put that this house disagree with lords amendment jack abbott zubir ahmed sadik al hassan tahir ali rosena

previously conclude be bring to conclusion one hour after their wakeford question agree to great british energy bill consideration of lords amendment must draw the house attention to the fact that financial privilege be engage by lords amendment and if either of lords amendment or be agree to will cause the customary entry waive commons financial privilege to be enter in the journal clause object beg to move that this house agree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss lord amendment amendment and and government motion to disagree lord amendment to be pleased that the great british energy bill have return to this house would like to thank all member of both houses for their scrutiny of this important legislation extend my thank in particular to the minister for energy security and net zero lord hunt of kings heath for his invaluable support and collaborative approach in guide the bill through the other place twelve amendment be make there which will seek to address today before turn to they remind the house that the government be elect on manifesto commitment to set up great british energy and that be exactly what the bill do since the bill be last in this house we have appoint five start up non executive director and announce dan mcgrail as interim ceo base in aberdeen so that great british energy can quickly get the expertise need to help the company develop be delighted to convene the first meeting of great british energy board of director last week in aberdeen we be determined to get great british energy deliver for the british people as soon as possible it have already make some incredibly exciting announcement on initial project include partnership with the crown estate and most recently announcement on solar for school and hospital across england with funding also for scotland wales and northern ireland we look forward to gbe make further investment decision on project this year drive forward our clean power mission and create thousand of job across the country in the process lord amendment would prevent the secretary of state from provide financial assistance to great british energy if credible evidence of modern slavery be find in its supply chain there have understandably be significant interest in this amendment from member in the other place and on both side of this house we recognise that concern have be raise widely on this issue and be seek to approach it in collaborative and open way with hon member will also address amendment to lords amendment as our approach to this amendment be similar first of all thank my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion for amendment have be grateful for her engagement with ahead of the bill return to this house also pay tribute to her tireless work over many year on this important issue her amendment would amend lords amendment make in the other place by create cross ministerial taskforce to which great british energy would need to prove that its supply chain be free of force labour want the house to be in no doubt that this government be absolutely committed to confront and tackle modern slavery in energy supply chain as set out by my colleague lord hunt in the other place great british energy have range of tool to tackle modern slavery in its supply chain gbe will prepare slavery and human trafficking statement when it meet the threshold set out under section of the modern slavery act that will outline the step it be take to ensure that slavery and human trafficking be not present in its supply chain or any part of its business under the procurement act gbe can reject bid and terminate contract with supplier that be know to use force labour themselves or that have it anywhere in their supply chain commit here that gbe will utilise the debarment list to ensure that supplier with unethical supply chain can not participate in procurement or be award contract by gbe that be not altogether correct the minister will know full well that the procurement act can only be enact once supplier have have conviction under section of the modern slavery act to do that proceeding have to be able to be take against the company that be involve in the slavery british company involve in agency be not involve in the slavery it would have to get the chinese government to prosecute the chinese company to make sure that they get prosecution here that be never go to happen thank the right hon gentleman for his contribution and his many year of work on this issue will come to some of the detail in addition to this measure but it be important to say that the debarment list which be part of the act pass by the conservative government have be in force since february and will be populate in due course we will use that list as the basis of challenge the decision that great british energy can make not to take contract with those on that list will look in more detail at the specific point that he raise and will come to some of that later in my speech in addition gbe will use the modern slavery assessment tool to assess its supply base for modern slavery risk we expect great british energy to take leading role in ensure that any company in which it invest can demonstrate their own assessment of their supply chain for exposure to force labour assure the house that with these tool gbe will tackle modern slavery head on where there be credible evidence of involvement anywhere in supply chain gbe will ensure that it do everything in its power to combat the scourge of modern slavery and to pull up the standard expect of the wide uk energy sector in the process my constituent dorit oliver wolff be holocaust survivor she know what slave labour look like and she have write to the prime minister to urge that our energy transition do not repeat so many of the atrocity that she have see she be await reply from the prime minister will the minister nudge no to ensure that she get the response that she need and deserve on her own behalf and that of victim of modern slavery across the world thank the hon gentleman for raise that point see that powerful letter which be widely report in the press be not sure that nudge no be quite within my gift but will certainly raise the issue for response the wide point raise be absolutely right recognise the need not just in the energy sector but across our economy to ensure that we remove any risk of force labour in supply chain we all share that commitment across the house we need number of different measure to make that happen be determined that great british energy will leader in the sector on do that particularly within the energy space return to the focus that great british energy will have at the high level of its work can commit today that it will appoint senior individual in the organisation to lead on ethical supply chain and modern slavery far the statement of strategic priority outline in the bill which the secretary of state will issue to gbe once it receive royal assent will include an overarching expectation that gbe proactively work to deliver on these commitment and in do so become sector leader in this space as we would expect from any company own by the british public to far demonstrate our commitment across government we will write to all ftse company outline our expectation on responsible business to ensure that these issue especially force labour and supply chain be be effectively identify and address give the importance of tackle modern slavery it be crucial that business play their part to tackle that abhorrent crime we can not do this without their support so it be an important step across government the minister be explain what the government be do but they be not do what member of this house and of the other place want not just ask people to do stuff but lead that be what this amendment do it would allow the uk to really show its leadership on behalf of the british public this will be huge public company why will the minister not just commit to that further step today let come to that point because the specific reason that we disagree with their lordship on this amendment be that it would not actually do what the hon gentleman say it would force the government to cease all gbe activity rather than give it the scope to address any of the issue that we be raise today directly within the framework that we have outline as say we as government be wholly commit to do this great british energy will be commit to ensure that the high standard be maintain the amendment would cease the funding immediately which would not give gb energy the scope to actually invest in the appropriate supply chain and to tackle those issue directly will the minister accept that many people listen to this will see it as evade rather than address the issue we can have the procurement act the taskforce and the letter to all the major company but the fact remain that most company will seek financial assistance for the kind of project that they wish to do if credible evidence be discover that supply chain have be contaminate by slavery the easy way of stop purchase from supplier who act in that way will be to say you not get any support do not disagree with that at all and that be possible nothing force great british energy or any other company to take investment from any individual or company they can choose not to do so for whole variety of reason and if one of those reason be credible evidence of modern slavery in the supply chain would fully expect they not to invest in those company that be exactly what we be talk about today the point be that that conversation must be broad than one just about great british energy it be about wide supply chain and company right across the economy and that be what we be hop to tackle in parallel although the energy sector be particularly important to want to work across government to outline comprehensive plan to tackle modern slavery which be question right across the economy rather than deal with the problem on company by company basis we must look to do so more broadly to drive forward that work confirm that in the come week will convene cross departmental ministerial meeting involve the department for business and trade the home office the foreign commonwealth and development office and my department to discuss how we can accelerate work across government on this really important issue be grateful to the minister for his speech and the consideration that he be give to this issue will he look at reverse burden of proof so that instead of prove an exclusion it be switch to show no association with modern slavery my hon friend make good point will come to that briefly in moment all of this work build on the implementation of the new procurement regime which focus on ensure fair and open competition and treat supplier equally as well as the work that we be do on the relaunche solar taskforce it start under the previous government and have continue under this government to develop resilient sustainable and innovative solar supply chain that be free from forced labour we recognise that the landscape have shift since the modern slavery act come into effect which be why yesterday the home office publish update statutory guidance on transparency in supply chain that provide comprehensive and practical advice for business on how to tackle force labour in their supply chain great british energy will of course follow any new measure on modern slavery to which it be subject just as any responsible public or private body should hope that the new step have outline will reassure the house that departments across government will continue to work intensively on this issue before move on will reflect briefly on amendment to lords amendment table by my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel which would require the independent anti slavery commissioner to define credible evidence in lords amendment while thank he for the amendment we have to resist it as the independent anti slavery commissioner role be establish to encourage good practice rather than to look specifically into supply chain of individual company the amendment would place significant lawmaking function on the commissioner which the role be not design for and be currently not within the commissioner power the amendment would also have wide implication for how evidence of modern slavery be assess and could create unnecessary legal uncertainty and precedent turn to the remain amendment the government be pleased to table lords amendment and lords amendment to follow positive discussion with peer in the other place lord amendment put community energy on the face of the bill the government have manifesto commitment to deliver step change in community energy across the uk we set up gbe to deliver our local power plan it be at the heart of our plan for gbe however we recognise that during the bill passage it be highlight that the role of community energy should be make explicit in the bill as my colleague in the other place say the government have accept that and it be right that that be now in the bill very much welcome the amendment do the minister agree that community energy be important not just for job and investment but for engage community with the transition to new energy system do he recognise the need for the government to support those initiative with funding go forward agree with my hon friend on both point community energy be incredibly important to give community stake in their energy future and to deliver the social and economic benefit that go with it just last week we announce significant amount of funding through gbe for community energy project across england and fund for scotland wales and northern ireland to spend on similar project include community energy project in their own area will the minister give way will give way briefly but then will have to make bit of progress can the minister advise the house on the level of recurrence to that funding will it be year on year funding will he also give we an indication maybe not precisely but broadly what that funding stream will be year on year under gb energy it will not be recur in the same methodology gbe do not yet exist so we carry out the initial set of investment in particular way go forward those project will be on the basis of the individual investment proposition put forward individual project in scotland or in other part of the uk will therefore apply for funding they will be consider alongside other investment and those investment will be make however we will not deliver funding on population share on that basis go forward of course funding be already go to the scottish government with significant increase in the budget this year to fund for example the community and renewable energy scheme and the community energy work which be go on in scotland already briefly lords amendment come in recognition of concern raise about the length of time gbe could operate without strategic priority we have agree to an amendment that would prepare set of strategic priority within six month although will say to the house as do in committee that we intend to move far fast than that lord amendment to be bring about follow positive engagement with the devolve government and we be commit to collaboration on uk wide basis the amendment which relate to clause move from consult with devolve government to consent in relation to devolve competency be grateful to my ministerial colleague in scotland wales and northern ireland for engage so productively and for the parliaments legislative consent motion on the bill lord amendment introduce an independent review of great british energy effectiveness finally lords amendment ensure that great british energy will keep the impact of its activity on sustainable development under review know that be concern raise by number of member in relation to how we conserve nature and biodiversity while advance clean power therefore hope the house will join in welcome that addition look forward to this debate albeit short and urge the house to support the government position on the amendment this be sad and quite incredible day in this house we have debate this government energy policy on many occasion in the past few month we have frequently debate the merit or lack thereof of great british energy an organisation about which we still know very little what it be for and what it will do we be tell by the labour party that it would bring down bill by but bill have go up we be tell by the labour party that it would create job but nobody can tell we how many or by when we be tell by the labour party that it would be base in aberdeen but the interim chairman be base in manchester and it look unlikely that we will see little more than brass plaque in the granite city we be tell that it would employ thousand of people but that then turn to hundred we be tell it would generate energy but it will not it do not have licence to do that we be tell that it would guarantee positive return on every investment but that be impossible therefore ask the minister again what will the entity actually do do they know will it be seek an electricity generation licence how will it bring down energy cost in this country turn to today proceeding far from the secretary of state and the minister insistence that great british energy will free we from reliance on foreign dictatorship this headlong rush to clean power by will in fact make we more reliant than ever on the people republic of china he and his ministers be quick to note the reluctance to rely on petrostate dictator wonder how he would characterise the people republic of china where political opposition be illegal where citizen have more limited political right than in the russian federation where dissent be invariably punish and where the use of forced labour be prove in we block china general nuclear from involvement in sizewell in we prevent chinese influence on our communication network under the guise of huawei yet despite serious concern about the national security implication the ethical implication and the high climate emission the secretary of state and ministers be open the gate to chinese technology in our north sea wind farm to solar panel make with slave labour and to use coal power it be in the context of our increase reliance on foreign state that wish to speak to the lords amendment and particularly lords amendment table by lord alton of liverpool be grateful to he and we all recognise his long stand dedication to this serious matter say that this be sad day and feel for those labour mp for many of whom have great deal of respect who come into this house into politic and specifically into their party because they believe in social justice and decency and for whom this be not just job but vocation they come here in july believe that they would be part of project to create well world in the spirit of bevan attlee hardie and wilson wonder what those titan of that proud labour movement would make of this today because it be on this day in that the abolition of the slave trade act receive royal assent and year on labour mp be go to be whip to allow the state to directly fund import of good build by slave labour in china interruption they complain but it be true what will those mp say to their constituent to their voter how will they explain this vote in the week that we mark year since the modern slavery act indeed how will they explain it to themselves we be proud to have introduce that act year ago it be landmark piece of legislation however it be right that we recognise now that the protection against the use of public money in supply chain with exposure to the use of modern slave labour need to be more robust they be vote against this incredibly sensible amendment that seek to protect some of the most oppressed people in the world and to ensure that our net zero objective whatever one view of they will not be build on the back of slave labour or on the back of the uyghur muslims of xinjiang and elsewhere the vast majority of solar panel be expose to xinjiang silicon where manufacturer have be find to have link to uyghur force labour therefore what we be see today be not simply the offshoring of our emission although we be and it be not just about the offshoring of our energy security although that be also true today we be see the offshoring of the labour party moral compass and we all know why because clean power by demand it the fact be that the government will not achieve that target that they sign up to without the help of china and without import this green revolution from coal power factory thousand of mile away they be pursue make in china energy transition build on the back of slave labour and power by chinese coal it be quite ironic that the minister be willing to stomach the high carbon emission associate with import liquefy natural gas from abroad the emission be four time high than those from drill at home the government want to import solar panel manufacture use coal power and taint by human right abuse rather than give our domestic supply chain the time to grow it be an irony that be not lose on we and neither will it be lose on the country this be be afraid the pyrrhic victory of ideology over sense and of zealotry over the national interest it be bad for britain it be bad for bill payer and it really be quite bad for the climate do my hon friend agree that build more of that infrastructure here in the united kingdom would be good for british job and for our energy security just as issue new oil and gas licence in scotland would be as that would allow we to produce more of our energy here at home and make we safe from volatile energy market abroad my hon friend will not be at all surprised to learn that agree with he entirely it be purely the imposition on this country of arbitrary needless target such as clean power by to generate headline and get the secretary of state name up in light that be require we to become more reliant on the people republic of china for the good technology and equipment to develop the solar farm nearly all of which will be taint by slave labour in some way give the reliance on slave labour in part of that country for that infrastructure and technology so of course agree with he and of course it would be much well if we be issue new licence and continue to support our own domestic oil and gas industry that be something that we have debate time and again and be sure we will come back to this house to debate it again in the future great british energy be not great it be not british and it will not generate any energy public fund should not be must not be funding import taint by modern slavery and slave labour british taxpayer deserve well domestic supply chain that create job at home rather than funding abuse abroad that be why we support lords amendment and urge labour members to do the right thing today and vote for it as well rise to speak to my amendment to lords amendment which hope might act as bridge between our two houses although welcome this bill from the moment it start its journey through parliament have be issue warning without proper safeguard in place our transition to net zero will be carry through on the back of those in slavery renewable energy be vital for our transition to low carbon economy but we know that human right abuse be inherent in our green technology there be evidence of child labour in cobalt mining in the democratic republic of the congo and of labour exploitation in nickel processing in indonesia force labour be commit at scale in xinjiang in china with the abuse of uyghurs in steel production material that make up nearly of our wind turbine and of course there be well document abuse in the production of solar panel on report be hugely grateful for the energy secretary commitment to we have be clear that no company in the uk should have force labour in its supply chain and we will be work with colleague across government to tackle the issue of the uyghur force labour in supply report october vol but too often we have accept warm word at the dispatch box that have fail to materialise the bill be serious piece of legislation not least as the government have commit to capitalise gb energy with over billion if company want to benefit from taxpayer money they must be able to prove that their supply chain be free of force labour have table amendment to that effect as it would place the burden of proof on business cross government work be the only way to end the stagnation in our response to modern slavery once slavery be find we must take action include by place rogue company on the procurement act debarment list to ban they from win other public contract the public deserve guarantee that their money will not be use to fund human right abuse to quote business and trade minister no company should have abuse in their supply chain so admire ministers resolve to give genuine commitment to root out slavery in their area of responsibility when it come to gbe my amendment offer simple cost effective method to achieve that be glad that the minister agree but for clarity let repeat what believe he have commit to and push he little far primarily will the minister confirm that there will be clarity within gb energy strategic objective and framework document that designate company must not use force labour in any part of their supply chain and that that need to be map down to raw material be glad that there will be cross ministerial working group to work across department to tackle slavery in supply chain that be exactly what need to happen and commitment to leverage the procurement act debarment list where there be evidence of bidder or supplier with unethical supply chain let we remember that the act include discretionary ground that do not require conviction of course all of that require designate leader within gbe to take accountability finally have one more ask will the minister prioritise buying british to boost our economy and avoid the risk of reliance on slave make renewable from international source of course the issue of modern slavery be big than renewable but we must start somewhere with clear path and strong commitment gb energy can lead from the front and stop the uk become dumping ground for slave make good base on the minister word and have seek those clarification will not press my amendment hope it also satisfy the other place that the minister have listen and act to stamp out modern slavery in gb energy future procurement and thank the minister for that call the liberal democrat spokesperson alongside community group across the country include power for people and community energy england be pleased to welcome the inclusion of community energy and benefit in the bill through lords amendment it be possible after all and congratulate the government on take this step we liberal democrats have push hard for that in this house and the other place but there have be lot of cross party work to achieve it and be delighted that its inclusion be now enshrine in law this be victory for community voice give they real stake in the energy transition through full or partial ownership of local power community like mine in south cambridgeshire where many be off grid and struggle with volatile oil price want to generate and sell their own green energy locally it be absurd that that be not possible there be five community energy scheme in my constituency and they all contribute to local energy supply an increase in community energy project would boost the local economy as my hon friend say create job and reduce energy cost especially in rural area do she agree that we must go far and create long term plan to support this type of initiative completely agree the great british energy bill give statutory steer that help we have those long term plan the clean energy transition have to be do with community not to community commend the government for commit an additional million to the community energy fund bring certainty at least to its short term future lord amendment also address community benefit which be critical for take people with we on this pathway to the energy transition if community be to host energy infrastructure whether for onshore wind or large scale solar farm those benefit have to go beyond token gesture such as roof for scout hut or some apprenticeship in scotland for example community benefit be worth per instal megawatt per year this mean that controversial large scale solar project in my constituency such as the kingsway solar farm could provide million annually to the local community that be the scale we should be talk about and it have to be the community that determine how and where that money be spend lords amendment be also vital addition to the bill require gb energy to keep its impact on sustainable development under review credit be due to baroness hayman who fight tirelessly in the other house to ensure that sustainability be embed in our energy transition through that amendment we welcome the assurance we have receive that in the update framework agreement not only will the local economy of coastal community be take into consideration but there will be an explicit climate and nature duty for gb energy gb energy have to consider economic environmental and social need ensure that future generation can meet their need would have like to discuss amendment in the name of the hon member for rotherham sarah champion and amendment in the name of the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel both to lords amendment modern slavery be barbaric practice that should have be eradicate long ago we look to the promise of our green energy transformation but it can not take place at the cost of human right abuse across the world research from sheffield hallam university have directly link china labour transfer programme to the global solar panel supply chain china produce of the world polysilicon and of its solar panel and right now million uyghurs be subject to state detention and force labour it be incomprehensible that the government be seek to vote down an amendment that would withdraw gb energy investment from supply chain taint by force labour gb energy have to set the standard not muddle along there be nothing sufficiently robust in the bill to ensure that there be no forced labour in this supply chain the solar taskforce do not have the mandate to ensure that as we have hear the procurement act can not address the issue this should be an issue not just for the energy sector the health sector have show leadership by address the matter in the health and care act the great british energy bill be key piece of legislation and measure on forced labour should be part of it this be not just about the practicality of the need to include these measure be it not essential that we show the public that the measure we be promote to achieve net zero cause for which there be overwhelming public support notwithstanding some party attitude to our need to get there and when be not taint by human right abuse completely agree that be why the liberal democrats will continue to call for restriction on trade with region where abuse take place include xinjiang and advocate for magnitsky style sanction against individual and entity involve in uyghur persecution this be about more than britain it be about play our part conscientiously in global movement to see all human right abuse stop rise to speak in support of my amendment to lords amendment in my capacity as member of the joint committee on human rights which be undertake an inquiry on force labour in uk supply chain lord amendment table in the lords by our chair lord alton of liverpool and pass there seek to prevent the secretary of state from provide financial assistance to any company designate great british energy when there be credible evidence of modern slavery in its supply chain my amendment take into account some of the argument make by the government in the lords and seek to refine the lords amendment by provide mechanism for determine credible evidence my amendment empower the independent anti slavery commissioner to define what constitute credible evidence of supply chain slavery it be craft so as to allow the bill to be as business friendly as possible while ensure that it still have tooth the commissioner be back this initiative welcome the bill support the creation of great british energy and the government commitment to achieve our net zero ambition and clean power by but we must have the high ethical standard for our solar industry the british public do not want our net zero future to be build on slave labour in its report source solar energy without uyghur force labour unison state that all polysilicon manufacturer in the uyghur region have participate in force labour transfer programme be supply by raw material manufacturer that have do so multiple uk public sector body have be find to procure solar material from company source polysilicon from the region as the uk solar capacity be set to double concern be mount that council and other public service body will get lock into long term contract with unethical supplier we must ensure that our solar supply chain be free from uyghur slave labour report by the china strategic risks institute estimate that if beijing be to restrict solar export it would cost the uk economy billion raise household energy bill by and stall our path to net zero it would leave our ability to meet climate goal and protect british consumer at the mercy of decision make in china we need only look at the raising of tariff around the world include on china to understand the risk of rely solely on china for polysilicon and solar panel if gb energy become reliant solely on solar panel from china we will not just be complicit in human right abuse but will create an enormous point of strategic vulnerability in our energy system that would give the chinese state lever of influence over our critical infrastructure and undermine our sovereignty professor laura murphy who until january this year be senior policy adviser to the united states department of homeland security on the uyghur forced labor prevention act and be perhaps the world lead expert on xinjiang supply chain state from human right and climate perspective the alternative of base our green energy future on xinjiang coal high carbon emission and on the forced labour of oppressed community be high and long term price to pay if we allow gb energy to contract with company that profit from modern slavery we directly undermine fair competition no british worker can compete with system that rely on forced labour in our manifesto we pledge secure well pay green job my amendment seek to ensure that british worker be not undercut by chinese renewable company that profit from modern slavery and that gb energy promote not only the development of the uk renewable sector but improve human right condition for all worker at each point in the supply chain it be true that the united states legislation have nudge company to diversify their supply chain and there be gradual move away from supplier use force labour in the united states number of company have be sanction under the uyghur forced labour prevention act for use force labour the solar taskforce while welcome step be not empower to assess modern slavery risk in procurement and neither be it equip with the anti slavery expertise necessary to mitigate those risk the taskforce work be come to conclusion so will the minister outline the step that will follow that work to ensure solid mechanism that exclude force labour product from the solar supply chain as my hon friend the minister have state no uk company should have force labour in its supply chain and the secretary of state for energy security and net zero reaffirm that position the secretary of state for business and trade give an absolute assurance that no modern slavery would be permit in supply chain affect uk good the amendment simply ensure that those commitment be enforce sadly the current statutory position have not be sufficient to prevent slave make renewable from enter the uk more must be do and the amendment be modest and business friendly way to incentivise clean supply chain the bill present an opportunity to use the government purchase power to nudge business in the right direction this week mark year since the modern slavery act become law once leader in the fight against modern slavery we be now in danger of fall behind the us as have outline and the eu the amendment present credible mechanism for ensure clean energy future as the minister outline this be just one way of ensure that we remove force labour from our supply chain he raise the prospect of use the procurement act and welcome what he say but the act require supplier to be convict under the modern slavery act or of an offence in their country relate to force labour the nature of force labour in china mean that it be disguised so those condition would not be meet will the welcome cross departmental working group which the minister announce in his opening statement look at the procurement act and ensure that it be fit for purpose will the group look at the way that the united states have use rebuttal presumption for good from xinjiang or at another similar mechanism as matter of urgency will the minister and his group ensure that we have the power and expertise to prevent force labour in our solar panel supply chain will he work with trade union non governmental organisation and the independent anti slavery commission on this will the minister meet and professor laura murphy who work on this issue at sheffield hallam university as matter of urgency to explore the detail of how we can ensure robust system like the one that she help to implement in the united states robust system not just for gb energy but for the whole solar industry agree with the minister that this be not just an issue for gb energy but for the whole industry will the minister work with to get workable debarment list so that we can ensure that gb energy be act on modern slavery will he give commitment that gb energy operate framework be commit to tackle force labour if get these assurance from the minister be happy to withdraw my amendment and work with the government cross departmental working group and other to ensure that we can take the scandal of force labour out of our solar supply chain be grateful to be call at this point madam deputy speaker other will want to speak so will be as brief as possibly can as say early the minister be incorrect in believe that the procurement act give any protection at all against modern slavery in the supply chain that be fact of life that we have know for age be one of those who bring the modern slavery act into be year ago but at that time we do not understand how bad the situation be in china over of polysilicon be make in china and we know for fact that of all the solar array be sell here contain polysilicon from xinjiang which will have be make by slave labour there be no dispute at all about that the question face the government be would be grateful if the minister could listen the question face the government be not whether they think that modern slavery be good do not for one moment accuse they of think that what have go missing and what lord alton amendment focus on be recognition that there be no requirement on the government to deal with slavery in the supply chain and no way for they to do that as have be say america have turn the burden of proof upside down and say we assume you have slave labour in your product you must prove to we that you do not that be the only way to deal with this the americans then sanction offend company but under our legislation the government do not have such measure available to they the procurement act do not even do whisper of that because it need prosecution to have be mount under the modern slavery act and that can not happen because company that be an agent for chinese make solar array will not be prosecute under the present law only the chinese company that make the solar array can be prosecute that mean that no prosecution will take place no company in china will be prosecute by the chinese government because the chinese government be the one who set up this ghastly process why because it make their array cheap than anybody else in the world that be how they have pretty much wipe out all other array production in the world let we ask ourselves where will we get our array from the answer be that we can not get they anywhere else but if we have to we would have to pay lot of money understand that there be probably debate go on in government about whether we go down that road which would make array awfully expensive in conclusion the government know the fact support amendment to lords amendment support the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel who bring it forward for the right reason and support the way in which the hon member for rotherham sarah champion bring forward her amendment to lords amendment the government must act if we do not act make force labour illegal and punish the company involve in it directly or as agent then we will be guilty of increase slavery in china that be what tonight debate be about be sorry that the government will get rid of this lords amendment they could have do deal to enhance it or whatever but now they will have to commit to come forward with legislation to increase and improve the act that they already have which will take another debate say to the government for goodness sake by the way have this issue with my own party when we be in government and vote against it vote with the labour party to put this provision in the health and care act we do that together hope nobody think that be be party political because be not be sanction by the chinese government because we raise this issue originally say to they that and many in this house will not stop until the government face up to one thing and one thing only not one life through modern slavery be worth low cost on solar array that should be the epitaph of the ridiculous position that the government be in as an energy industry professional before enter this place be very pleased to see that great british energy be make impressive stride it have secure landmark partnership with the crown estate and we have see it commit to more and more solar power which be much welcome by my constituent we have also see investment in carbon capture and storage cluster in teesside and merseyside bring thousand of job to those area more broadly welcome the government move to lift the ban on onshore wind in england and to promote funding in new emerge industry include hydrogen and fusion energy also look forward to the government announce the winner of the small modular reactor contract at some point over the come week when hope that the government will also place sizeable order as we advance towards future of clean secure home grow energy we must ensure that that future be build on principle of justice and respect for human right will therefore speak to lords amendment since be elect last year as the member of parliament for rushcliffe have be contact by constituent voice their concern about what be happen in the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china in sir geoffrey nice kc deliver the uyghur tribunal judgment here in london deeming that the chinese government policy amount to deliberate systematic and concerted policy to bring about long term reduction of uyghur and other ethnic minority population be afraid that forced labour be be use as key instrument in this campaign of oppression more than million uyghurs have be detain in re education camp and many be transfer to work in factory mine and field under barbaric condition as have be mention some of those factory produce polysilicon which be critical component in of the world solar panel on that basis it be estimate that around of the uk solar industry may be at risk of source material taint by this state sponsor forced labour that be why believe this house have responsibility to ask hard question as these lords amendment have do if we be to stand as country that champion both human right and climate action we must ensure that our clean energy future be not build on the back of exploit people the choice we make on legislation such as this on who receive british taxpayer money and what standard we demand in procurement be not abstract they be ultimately measure of whether we be willing to trade convenience for complicity it be therefore right that we always examine how supply chain operate it be right that we consider how credible evidence of forced labour should be define and who be well place to determine that it be right that we reflect on whether our current legal framework be sufficient as have be mention the modern slavery act be groundbreake at the time but it lack the tooth to tackle the forced labour take place in xinjiang in that context we should note the step take across the atlantic in june it will be three year since the uyghur forced labor prevention act take effect in the united states and believe similar resolve be need here in the united kingdom we should expedite update and strengthen our modern slavery legislation in the light of great british energy ambitious plan the uyghur people and other face slavery around the world deserve to know that britain will not turn blind eye we can not end all injustice but we can ensure that our law procurement policy and public financing do not sustain atrocity therefore implore the government to listen to member on the labour and opposition benches today thank the minister for the significant step he have already outline and ask he to reassure we once more that the relevant step will be take to prevent great british energy from in any way contribute to promote or sustain known atrocity appreciate that number of member still want to speak so will keep my comment short the government refusal to support lords amendment show the absolutism of their net zero and energy policy the amendment be not only sensible but morally correct and in vote against it the government be signal that their ambition to reach net zero trump everything else can that really be correct if we can not support those who be suffer from modern slavery what be we do be the rush to net zero really worth that net zero be intend to prevent people on this planet from go down route towards planet that be not inhabitable that be what we have be sell what be we save the planet for if not to enable people to work in safe secure way we can not sacrifice that we can not condone force labour by sell our moral to china in order to rush towards net zero the uyghur muslims in china do not have safe secure place to work they be oppress and by not support lords amendment the government be support that oppression we have rightly condemn slavery in the past the government have rightly condemn past slavery but they be now happy to condone force labour in china it be an unbelievable situation that we find ourselves in but we be get use to this sort of behaviour from the government we have see the heartless policy that they have implement since they come to power whether that be the family farm tax the tax on job that be put people out of work or tax child hospice which the government have vote for this afternoon by not support lords amendment the government be effectively say that they be happy to turn blind eye to modern slavery across the world that be something that conservative members can not possibly support until july last year those in the labour party be happy to promote their moral but it seem that those moral be leave in front of the last door they knock on in july rise with the leave of the house call the minister with the leave of the house will sum up the debate thank all right hon and hon member for their contribution to this debate although it have be short on number of the amendment but perhaps most importantly on forced labour and modern slavery in our economy want to reflect on some of the contribution from member on both side of the house but let start by say that hear the very strong view that have be express on this issue it be right that government of whatever party constantly challenge themselves to go far in tackle these issue because as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith put it even one person be affect by force labour be an absolute disgrace we should collectively tackle that issue use whatever mean we can as such want to reiterate clearly that contrary to some of the contribution we have hear from conservative members lords amendment be about amend the great british energy bill not about the government wide commitment to tackle modern slavery it can be repeat as often as conservative member like but it be simply disingenuous to come to this place and suggest that the labour party have suddenly decide not to care about this issue really do take issue with that will the minister give way the right hon gentleman be not in the chamber for lot of the debate but will give way to he think the minister would accept that lords amendment be very modest proposal that could make significant difference to people life and outcome in china there be talk of labour buy off its back benchers by say that further legislation be come down the line be that in six month time year time or two year time when be it go to come first the right hon gentleman care so much about the issue that he have only just turn up to the debate secondly he be senior member of the government for year if this be an issue that he care about so much why be we here debate it now the truth be that the previous government could have tackle this issue in much clear way will not follow he on that point as say clearly in open the debate which do not think the right hon gentleman be here for there should no modern slavery anywhere in our economy or our supply chain to deliver we must work across government and across the economy because it be not just about the investment that great british energy make rise will give way briefly to my hon friend the member for st helens south and whiston ms rimmer and then need to finish the modern slavery act and the procurement act do not work in this area to do anything two criterion must be meet and they be only advisory in the world health organisation we have to prove that organ harvesting be not an ethical organ transplant system and we can not get to the supply chain which be state invent state impose and disguised urge the minister to give commitment that he will listen to the argument in these two amendment understand the argument that my hon friend be make but the issue she rightly highlight as other member have go much wide than great british energy which the bill set up as publicly own energy company those issue be about the wide economy and investment across our supply chain will the minister give way need to close be sorry in part we be set up great british energy because we want to deliver home grow supply chain and an industrial strategy in spite of the conservative party have completely fail to deliver that for year in fact it have complete ignorance of how to build supply chain have it deliver on some of the supply chain in this country we might not have to import so much interruption opposition member can shout all they want they know that they fail on this matter and we be pick up the piece for those member who be in the debate want to respond to the point raise in particular in the powerful speech make by my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion on her point about how widespread the problem of forced labour be that underline why piecemeal approach legislate on individual company here and there be not the right one we need to work across government to tackle the problem throughout the economy she ask for clarity on some of the point make she be right to reiterate the point that intend to pull together ministers from across government include the foreign office the home office the department for business and trade and my department to look at how we can collectively tackle the issue there will be designate leader within great british energy to drive this work forward we will utilise the debarment list more broadly we fully expect great british energy to do everything in its power under the relevant guidance and legislation to remove any instance of force labour from supply chain gbe must not approve the use of product from company that may be link to force labour this be an important debate on bill that be in our manifesto it deliver the first new national publicly own energy generation company in year it be back by the british public and it will deliver job and investment all over the country it will deliver the deployment of clean power we will tackle the supply chain to ensure that job come to this country and that we tackle the scourge of modern slavery not just through gbe but across the economy that be our commitment urge member to support the government position in the second have leave reiterate the point make early be willing to work with member across the house to tackle this fundamental issue which be of extreme importance across the government one hour have elapse since the commencement of proceeding on the lords amendment the proceeding be interrupt programme order this day the deputy speaker put forthwith the questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be conclude at that time standing order no lords amendment agree to clause financial assistance motion make and question put that this house disagree with lords amendment shanks

spirit of support co operation and openness in which we suggest small amendment to the bill and believe amendment be table in the other place in that same spirit we particularly welcome the change from invitation to ticket and the clarity that provide on private event be out of scope of this legislation we be sorry not to see more of those amendment in this place for debate urge the minister

community institution we continue to have concern that in its current form the legislation risk add to the already enormous burden of regulation and paperwork that small hospitality and community

minimum wage amendment regulations which be lay before this house on february be approve the purpose of the regulation be to increase the national living wage rate and the national minimum wage rate on april the regulation be lay in draft before parliament on february and approve by the other place on march the government be commit to make work pay the plan to make work pay will tackle the low pay poor working condition and poor job security that have be hold our economy back for far too long early this month the house approve passage of the landmark employment rights bill which will benefit more than million worker in every corner of the country and deliver the big upgrade to worker right in generation some aspect of the bill and accompany legislation and guidance will not come into effect for some time as the government continue to engage with stakeholder business and trade union on its implementation when we take office last year however we commit to take immediate action where we could and on the minimum wage we have do so one of the proud achievement of the last labour government be the creation of the national minimum wage which eliminate the extreme low pay that be blight our country we be proud to say that one of the first action take by this labour government within month of last year general election be to overhaul the remit to the low pay commission for the first time the remit now explicitly include the cost of live as one of the key factor to be consider when make national living wage recommendation we have begin the journey towards create genuine living wage as well as extend that to all worker age over by move towards single adult rate before turn to the precise detail of the regulation want to extend my thank to the low pay commission the commissioner and their official have work diligently and efficiently particularly after the update to the remit be make and we be pleased to accept all their recommendation that be testament to their social partnership model and expert analysis and engagement which ensure that the government can deliver on their ambitious agenda but without adversely impacting on business the labour market or the wide economy turn to the detail of the regulation which after parliamentary approval will take effect on april the national living wage rate which currently apply to worker age and over will increase from to that represent rise of or which be well above all measure and projection of inflation therefore deliver real term pay increase to an estimate million worker we will also be deliver large increase to the other national minimum wage rate the to year old rate will increase by from an hour to an hour that be record increase for that age group it mean that full time worker on the minimum wage rate will see their gross annual earning increase by around year well earn pay rise and significant step towards parity with the headline rate the national minimum wage rate for to year old will be equal to of the national living wage in compare with in the minimum wage rate for worker above school leaving age but under year old will increase from to an hour large rise of or the same rise will apply to the apprenticeship minimum wage rate which apply to apprentice age under or in the first year of their apprenticeship finally the accommodation offset rate which be the maximum daily amount that an employer can charge worker for accommodation without it affect their pay for minimum wage purpose will increase by or to draw member attention to the comprehensive impact assessment which the department publish alongside this legislation as they may have note the impact assessment which include an equality assessment have receive green fit for purpose rating from the independent regulatory policy committee as have touch on we estimate that the increase to the minimum wage rate will deliver direct pay increase for over million worker while an additional million could benefit from the positive spill over effect the minimum wage have greatly reduce pay inequality in the uk with the share of low pay job in hourly term estimate at in that be record low and down from in but the work do not stop there as we continue to build towards genuine living wage and the extension of eligibility to worker age between and by end the discriminatory age band to that end we will publish in due course fresh remit to the low pay commission ask it to recommend minimum wage rate to apply from next april as part of this the low pay commission will consult about the appropriate trajectory towards the single adult rate as we ensure that this be deliver without adverse impact on youth employment as well as participation in training and education like the previous labour government with their creation of the minimum wage over quarter of century ago this labour government will be proud to leave profound legacy for worker right because we be make work pay and we be proud to make more progress on this by support this instrument today commend the regulation to the house call the shadow minister rise to say that we will not oppose the increase to the national minimum wage or the national living wage the national living wage be something that my party introduce to make work pay we celebrate the fact that progress be make in end low pay and the minister cite that from the dispatch box this evening but it be also our duty as his majesty official opposition to scrutinise the government on all matter so have several question for the minister this evening in particular want to highlight the fact that the work that the low pay commission have do for which also thank it be do before the budget of broken promise last october after the increase to the national living and minimum wage in the budget but also measure such as the increase to national insurance the unison assistant general secretary jon richards welcome the increase to the pay measure but say that as it stand the new legal minimum be more than the current low hourly rate in the nhs university and some other public service this will give employer multiple headache so my first question be what will the government do to address the pay implication of this rise on those work in the public sector in such important role the second question relate to the national minimum wage for worker above school leaving age but not yet go up by nearly on april this year the national insurance threshold for employer drop to per year this mean that an employer will have to start pay national insurance on any young person if they work for or more hour week because of this business have warn that they be cut back on hire young worker or reduce the hour that they give to they that risk of course be face not solely by those in work but by those seek to get into work what assessment have the minister make since the budget of the impact of the increase on young people ability to access job what will the government do to ensure that young people or those look for job will not be penalise by this increase the increase will significantly affect small and medium sized enterprise as usual it look like they will bear the brunt of the increase labour cost it look that way not just to we accord to the government own impact assessment sme will face of the cost of the increase despite represent only of the share of employment that be another cost increase on small business which already have to pay for this government national insurance job tax for the hike in business rate and for the impact of the measure from the employment rights bill in particular business in the retail hospitality and leisure sector be most likely to pay the minimum wage remind the house that the government own impact assessment state that they expect the policy cover within the bill to impose direct cost on business of up to billion year it also note that on average those cost will be great for those small business and microbusinesse will the minister provide the house with figure for the total cost increase of employ someone full time on the previous national living wage because of the other change introduce by his government the government have create challenging business environment they recognise that themselves when they state in their impact assessment that there be some evidence of challenge business condition for sme around and of microbusinesse and small business respectively report have less than three month of cash reserve in september we support the principle of fair pay for worker and make work pay however have listen to business we be concerned that the rise could impact worker and business in industry already face financial challenge through range of unintended consequence it be easy for those in whitehall to squiggle their pen but all those measure combine have real life consequence for business across the country the national insurance job tax and the employment rights bill be pile additional cost on to business and hammer the private sector which we rely on to grow the economy in summary have the government consider the full impact of all these increase on business that be happen at the same time fear that tomorrow emergency budget will be another wakeup call we have hear how the rise in the national minimum wage will deliver direct pay increase for over million worker for the first time in history the minimum wage in this country be be link to the true cost of living begin the journey of make it genuine living wage we can take from history wealth of economic evidence on the positive impact of minimum wage which show they lead to overall rise in pay with no significant impact on employment although take on board the question of the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin and appreciate her contribution as fellow treasury committee member study have show time and again that while similar concern echo throughout the and the overall outcome of increase the minimum wage be simply that an increase in pay with no significant impact on employment do my hon friend agree that many of the concern share by the conservatives be the same as those raise at the time of the introduction of the minimum wage yes that be the case we have hear such concern raise throughout history yet when we look at econometric evidence that look in hindsight at the actual impact on the economy we see that there be no discernible impact will whizz through few different study in the united states there be david card and alan krueger study base on the increase in new jersey minimum wage the rise in california minimum wage and the federal minimum wage increase the follow year in the european union there be tomas kucera study from country in the uk there be christian van stolk study we can go on and on about the evidence but we can see from the trend that although these concern have be raise over time the outcome be increase in the minimum wage which be what we be seek to ensure do my hon friend agree that these uplift be huge boost for equality because they benefit woman young and old worker worker with disability and those from minority ethnic background more than other absolutely agree as the women budget group have show the measure on the minimum wage in the employment rights bill will disproportionately benefit female worker who be likely to be pay less than man these study on the minimum wage use econometric method to confirm what many of we can see in our community at first hand that too many people have too long be due pay rise and when we make the low pay well off that spending go back into our high street and local economy would like to see even more study do produce well datum that must start with improvement to the labour force survey which the hon member for west worcestershire and have discuss on the treasury committee as many organisation have flag that datum as an area of concern today want to focus on one particular group of low pay worker who be very significant for and my constituency of earley and woodley young people there be around undergraduate at the university of reading which sit in my constituency who will be well off because of this new law that raise the minimum wage for to year old to an hour it will mean record wage boost for that age group who will see their gross annual earning rise by and for apprentice too who be the skilled worker of tomorrow support the government youth guarantee to ensure that all young people be in education employment or training the king trust have find that one in young people outside of education employment or training have turn down job because they could not afford the cost associate with it for example travel clothing or childcare for many young people barrier to employment be that it do not pay well enough for they my hon friend be make an excellent speech be concern by what think hear the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin say about the rate at which the living wage be pay to young people almost advocate for reduction in that rate because of the impact it would have on business do my hon friend agree that be rather regressive view give that what young people need be the ability to pay their bill live life they enjoy and build home for themselves in the future very much agree with that sentiment young people be the future and to ensure they get off to the good possible start in life they need work that pay and enable they to live in stability not concerned about pay the bill from day to day or month to month most young people nowadays have to do mixture of work and education or training to make end meet more than half of full time student be work long hour in pay job in which be significant rise from during the pandemic when two third have no term time employment that have be drive by the escalate cost of live for young people and especially rise in rent want to quote constituent of mine call poppy who be year old and study at the university of reading she say work part time be never optional but rather necessity with my wage be so low find myself work hour week lead to miss some lecture and seminar throughout the month want to ensure that young people such as poppy be able to study without worry about how they be go to pay their bill we also know that young people be less unionised which mean they have less bargaining power and less ability to fight against unfair term or ask for pay rise so it be even more important that we support they by raise the minimum wage in conclusion it be essential that we make work pay for the sake of our high street our living standard and our future our young people poppy say personally can not wait for the new minimum wage increase in april as it mean should be able to reduce my hour at work give more time to focus on my study for people like poppy in my constituency and across the uk the new deal for work people be transformational and be very glad to support today motion call the liberal democrat spokesperson let begin by thank the government for lay this important statutory instrument the liberal democrats welcome this uplift in the minimum wage we all have constituent who we know be struggle to make end meet nobody should be in position where they can not pay their bill despite be in employment be particularly pleased that apprentice and those under will benefit from increase pay under this instrument in few week time will join wilshire college student and business across my constituency at career fair and this will be an important piece of legislation to share with they my constituency be rural and many of the people represent be elderly and depend on the social care system to stay independent unfortunately they be struggle to get the care they need and deserve in part because care worker be not be pay properly if we pay care staff more we might encourage more people into that hugely understaffed sector in south west england alone there be vacant job and in rural constituency such as mine where public transport be expensive and unreliable care staff be not compensate for their travel time and they often end up bring home less than the minimum wage while share the official opposition concern about small business of which my constituency have huge number it be important that low pay worker earn enough to live especially our young people and woman if the government be to adopt the liberal democrat proposal for carer minimum wage which would see carer receive more per hour than the current minimum wage staggering care worker across the uk would benefit from that increase in pay and over of they would be woman we understand that the carer minimum wage be not silver bullet but it be serious proposal that could make big difference to patient and family across the country although the liberal democrats support increase the minimum wage it be shame that this statutory instrument do not go far and give weight to that proposal draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests be member of the unison trade union when the national minimum wage come into force on april be work as trade union official in unison northern region represent many low pay member of staff who be work in social care and other sector in the north east and with colleague in the tuc who in many case be on even low wage that fantastic achievement come after year of fighting in the face of huge opposition at the time from the conservative party but after year of the national minimum wage think we can say that the argument have be definitively win so much so that there be member of this house who have never know time without statutory minimum wage on april be proud to don high vis vest and join my trade union colleague and member on march across the tyne bridge from gateshead to newcastle that be part of the campaign for living wage to celebrate the introduction of the national minimum wage and to argue for it to be improve we be lead by the then general secretary of unison rodney bickerstaffe and well remember photograph in our local newspaper as we prepare for the march with an aa sign direct traffic that say campaign for living wage long delay expect well we have continue to campaign for living wage since that time be so glad to speak here today with labour government again in power make real progress towards real living wage the change we be make with this legislation will mean direct real term pay increase for over million worker that include step towards single adult rate with record increase in the minimum wage for to year old amount to per year as well as direction to the low pay commission to look at the cost of live in its future decision back in when the national minimum wage be first introduce it make such difference to so many people in the north east similarly know that the legislation we be pass today will make huge difference to my constituent let be clear that my ambition be for good well pay job for people in the north east my constituent and people in our region deserve decent pay and secure work and will continue to work towards that meanwhile for those on minimum wage this legislation will mean more money in their pay packet which be real labour achievement take with our employment rights bill that mean there will be real shift for work people across the country and in my region increase to the national living wage and national minimum wage will always be support by scottish national party member indeed we have be push for the uk government to adopt the real living wage for those of all age since disappointingly we have to continue to do so as the labour party have fail to take the opportunity to do that now that it be in government while we support the change that be be introduce today the snp position be clear we want the real living wage for all worker not just politically convenient definition of the living wage that fall short of meet the actual cost of living and not just for those who be and over the resolution foundation have the real living wage set at whereas this regulation increase the national living wage for worker age or over from to per hour it be evidently still short of where it need to be furthermore for those age between and the national living wage be low at per hour give that the minister today say that there would be consultation look at the cost of living can he tell if rent be low for those under do year old get special rate on their electricity bill or on petrol for their car do supermarket give they an discount on that point will the hon member give way will not as would like to make this point very clear because it be important the answer to my question be obviously no while welcome the minister comment that the national living wage may be look at next year and may be increase so that there be parity for everybody we be not there yet would like the government to go far and look forward to hear more about how they will consult on do so next year it be worth note that in scotland the snp government have take proactive step to ensure that the real living wage be implement wherever we have control particularly in our public sector the scottish government have pay all staff within their pay scheme include nhs staff the real living wage since that is year ago scotland have the high proportion of employee pay the living wage of any nation in the uk with of accredited real living wage employer in the uk base there the scottish government be also provide funding to enable adult social care worker to be pay the living wage benefit up to care worker and they be work to ensure that all staff in private nursery deliver our childcare pledge be pay the real living wage too the labour government should demonstrate similar willingness to tackle the scourge of low pay in their manifesto they pledge to make change in line with the real living wage and to take into account the cost of living but they have fail at least today to do so they be vote in with mantra of change and it be in their power to legislate for the introduction of the real living wage for all but so far they have choose not to they must go far and adopt the living wage for people irrespective of their age as the snp have call on successive government to do for the past year draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and to my trade union membership welcome today move by the government to bring record pay boost of around to over million worker the measure will also mean record wage boost for to year old who will see their gross annual full time earning rise by for apprentice the skilled worker of tomorrow there will be boost of so that they can learn their trade with well financial security why be all of that important because when visit food bank in my constituency in doncaster have be sadden to learn that some of the people access those service be in work yet still can not make end meet for too long in this country work have not pay but with this legislation that will change we hear lot about the tough choice that this government have have to make after the year of conservative government whether because of the conservatives disastrous mini budget which leave mortgage soar the neglect of our prison which be allow to fill up to the point of collapse or the lack of investment in our nhs this labour government have take number of very difficult decision to get our country back on track but can tell hon member that it have not be tough choice to give million of worker pay rise it have not be tough choice to ensure that our apprentice have well financial security in fact it be choice that be proud to make it show that this government value worker across the country and value the work contribution of young adult from the age of this measure along with our landmark employment rights bill will mean that it will once again pay to work in this country and secure employment will be the foundation of the british economy which will be strong go forward the increase in the national minimum wage in the next fortnight be very welcome nobody in work in this wealthy country of our should be struggle to make end meet while that uplift be step in the right direction it do not address the challenge that we face in social care both nationally and in devon the area that know well devon have fill social care position but position remain unfilled and be very concerned about that shortage in the workforce it partly explain why people be go without care and why our hospital be struggle to discharge patient take the hon member point about the social care sector do he therefore welcome labour employment rights bill which include negotiating framework for our social care staff to ensure that they be properly pay and can progress in their job think negotiating framework might be helpful but lot will depend on the negotiation it would be far well if the government look at the minimum wage sector by sector and identify social care as special case the turnover rate for social care staff in devon be that be not only high than the national average but roughly double the figure for other sector that be why want separate high minimum wage for social care strike of social care worker cite low pay as the primary reason why they leave the job many of they be simply not pay enough for the skilled difficult and vital work they do and many be earn more by move into job such as stack supermarket shelf important though that be than by do the vital work of social care in rural county such as devon people have to travel long distance between the people for whom they care which sometimes mean that their real income be less than the national minimum wage we in devon be look at shortage of social care bed devon county council project that by devon will face shortfall of care home bed for old people with complex need look far ahead the situation get bad by in honiton the unmet need will be care bed in cullompton the need will be care bed in seaton and ottery st mary an additional care bed will be require by then the shortage of facility in mid and east devon make it plain that even more care worker will be require to meet the grow demand for social care that be why the liberal democrats be call for the introduction of carer minimum wage per hour more than the minimum wage of course that funding can not come from thin air accord to skills for care increase pay by between and per hour above the national minimum wage for care worker could save up to million from reduced hospital admission but there would need to be some funding up front to make that happen suggest that the remain funding come from an additional tax on the gambling industry which accord to public health england cost the uk economy about billion annually due to the financial physical and mental impact of problem gambling and the result crime and loss of productivity accord to the gambling commission adult and child in the uk suffer from problem gambling it be not an industry that we should be incentivise through low taxation double the remote gaming duty be recommend by the social market foundation that would not only address the harm of problem gambling but be fair way of funding that per hour increase above the national minimum wage for social care worker it be time that the government act to ensure that those who profit from gambling contribute more to the public good increase pay for the lowest pay social care worker be simple effective step to attract and retain staff and ensure that people in our community receive the care that they require support the national minimum wage increase but we must go far and pay our social care staff more recognise their vital role in look after the elderly and vulnerable strongly welcome the propose increase to minimum wage rate which will help people of all age across all community in our country there be particularly welcome boost for apprentice who be the future of our economy those increase will make real difference to people in my constituency and across our great nation for three reason first as colleague have say we must make work pay that be vital for the health of our economy it be crucial that we ensure that those who contribute to our economic growth deliver service in our community and manufacture the good that we need be fairly reward but for too long that have not be the case in my constituency or in other area between and salary growth in county durham be among the low in the united kingdom increase at less than half the rate of the growth in region such as london to tackle these issue we need to drive economic growth in region like mine but we also need clear action to ensure that those on the low wage see the growth in their pay that they deserve secondly it be crucial that we tackle the cost of living crisis in the two and half year spend campaign as labour candidate before be elect to this house the cost of living crisis be raise with time and again family after family have be hit by rise bill but flatline pay that issue affect my local resident particularly acutely because median weekly pay for those in full time work in my constituency be less week than the uk average that be month less to pay the bill and make end meet that be why it be so vital that this time the government have take the cost of live into account when set minimum wage level thirdly we must support growth if we be to grow our economy route into work include apprenticeship entry level job and other route into start career must be attractive key part of that be have pay level that reward those go into work and incentivise participation in the labour market for young people in my constituency get job with decent pay have too often mean move away from the town they grow up in that be another reason why this direct action to tackle low pay be so important as the representative of constituency with significant history of manufacturing include modern manufacturing such as in the fantastic hitachi train factory particularly welcome the wage increase for to year old and for those on apprenticeship it will ensure that young people go into work who be the future of our country manufacturing sector be pay properly and that secure future be possible locally come into politic to make genuine difference to the people of my home town of newton aycliffe the wide constituency and our country increase the minimum wage be one way to do that put more money into the pocket of million of our citizen that be the difference labour government make this government have make solid commitment to make work pay and put more money into work people pocket in my constituency we have large number of distribution job and as result of this government action people in kettering on the minimum wage will have more money in their pocket to last they through to the end of the month have spend my career in business know how important it be for business to have productive motivated workforce with minimal turnover that benefit not only business but worker in kettering it mean that people earn decent wage will spend their money support our local economy it be shameful that the conservative party let this country get to place where people who work full time be queue at food bank to feed their family the uplift in the national minimum wage be huge part of the national renewal that labour have promise this country and will mean pay increase for million people in kettering and across the uk young people in my constituency deserve minimum wage that reflect the work they do speak to many to year old in kettering who face the same financial pressure as adult old than they one of the good thing about my job be visit many school and college across my constituency where young people talk to about their plan for their future this uplift will mean wage boost of for apprenticeship in kettering so that we can incentivise young people to see apprenticeship as financially viable option and start to fill the skill gap that business across the uk face after difficult year under the conservatives the last labour government bring in the national minimum wage and it be this labour government who will secure britain future and make work pay start by declare an interest as proud member of the gmb and unison union this be debate about four number million and million three million be the number of people who will benefit from the fantastic measure be announce today be how much they will benefit real life change amount while be how much someone age to year old will benefit from these change and million be the number of people whose life will see transformative impact from our employment rights bill all of that be be achieve by labour government with our plan for change deliver security for work people but so much of it be oppose by the conservatives on day when we be debate give pay rise to million people it be strike and speak volume that the opposition benches be completely empty that be the difference between the government and the conservatives that pay rise be the difference that labour government make the opposition spokesperson the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin just try slightly to rewrite history but be old enough to remember the pre minimum wage era and who bring it to an end labour government the introduction of the national minimum wage be radical and transformative step and it be oppose every step of the way by the conservatives when labour include policy for minimum wage in our manifesto michael howard claim that it would destroy up to million job when we bring it to this place as legislation in the conservatives fight it tooth and nail every single step of the way the conservatives concern turn out to be totally unfounded it be pointless opposition to measure that increase the wage of more than million worker immediately in the uk as the evidence from my hon friend the member for earley and woodley yuan yang point out indeed the shadow chancellor at the time now well know for his railway journey eventually end tory opposition to the minimum wage say the minimum wage have cause less damage to employment than we fear how different the picture look today we have leader of the opposition who recently say that the minimum wage be overburden business and that maternity pay be excessive in an article for conservativehome the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon mel stride say that our measure to boost employment right and make work pay would have negative effect on business especially in low wage sector like hospitality and retail perhaps the shadow chancellor do not realise that the entire point of these measure be to bring these worker in particular young worker out of low pay to improve retention to keep people in work and to boost our economy the low wage low growth economy that the conservatives preside over for year bring with it stagnation and grow number of people who either leave employment or never enter it in the first place give that we all know where we stand will wrap up by say that this measure represent choice our choice be to increase the minimum wage and put money back in the pocket of work people it be choice to put people first it will help thousand of people in hendon and million of people across this country and it be choice be proud to support may begin by declare an interest as member and former employee of unison know that its young member will welcome the unprecedented rise in the minimum wage for to year old as we have already hear it will add year to their gross salary this be record change and it will make huge difference for young constituent of mine moreover the labour government have make it clear that this be only the start of journey we be work towards increase the youth rate so that we eventually have single adult rate equal pay for equal work have long be belief of the labour party and it be right that that also extend to young people but be delighted that this labour government will also deliver for disabled and black asian and minority ethnic worker and that we have embark on consultation on the introduction of mandatory pay gap reporting in respect of those worker the change in the youth rate in particular go hand in hand with our youth guarantee and our plan to create pathway to good quality employment for those under with health condition whom the last government leave on the scrapheap with no help at all labour will ensure not only that those young people be help to find job but that those job be decently pay we will make work well choice than benefit for young people as say early the decision that we be make today be the beginning of journey the shadow minister the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin say that the conservatives would not vote against the motion although must say that in her speech she give very good impression of someone who be against it in my view if the conservatives do not agree with it they should vote against it and should tell we how much they think young people be worth they should tell we whether we should pay they an hour they should tell we whether be the minimum wage that they would pay they should let we know by how much they would cut people wage in contrast the labour government be proud to be put money back into million work people pocket money that they will spend with local business and in local high street after year of failure from the conservatives labour be make work pay with the leave of the house madam deputy speaker will begin by address the many contribution that be make to what think be overall very positive debate welcome the support of the liberal democrats and also welcome the hon member for chippenham sarah gibson to the chamber it be good to see she back in her place she make some important point about the social care sector we know that the abuse of travel time reimbursement be huge issue the low pay commission be keen to look into it and be sure that once the fair work agency be up and run it will focus on it as well the hon lady colleague the hon member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord also talk about the importance of that sector our impact assessment have establish that about one in five social care worker will receive direct pay rise as result of the increase announce today as would be expect before make its recommendation the low commission have consult widely with among other representative of social care worker we believe that they have be undervalue for far too long which be why we be introduce the first ever fair pay agreement in the adult social care sector so that care professional be recognise and reward for the important work that they do while appreciate the hon member wish for separate rate for care worker we think we be take the right measure to recognise and value they the operation of different rate bring range of challenge relate to enforcement and to clarity for employer which we think be important there be have to say number of excellent speech from the labour benches my hon friend the member for earley and woodley yuan yang make the positive economic case and refer to the wealth of evidence in support of increase in the minimum wage on the labour benches we passionately believe that increase protection at work and increase in the minimum wage be good not just for individual but for the wide economy she mention the many young people in her constituency who will benefit from the move to parity for the to age band with the adult rate my hon friend the member for ealing southall deirdre costigan have great knowledge and experience in this area she say that this be the beginning of the journey that be right we recognise that it will take time to achieve our ambition for the low pay commission for the people in this country but it be journey we be determined to finish my hon friend the member for blaydon and consett liz twist take we back into the depth of history must declare that be one of those who can remember what it be like before the minimum wage when tell my child how much use to earn in my first job they can not believe it but it be true that be what the world be like before the minimum wage she also remind we of the doom laden warning we get from the conservative opposition at the time we hear small echo of that tonight but think history have prove that those warning be wrong my hon friend the member for doncaster central sally jameson speak passionately about the issue with in work poverty which be one of the key thing that we must change in this country for too long people have not have work pay for they earning have not keep up with the cost of live and that be one of the reason why the low pay commission remit have change be very grateful to the minister for give way the low pay commission previously say that about people be not be pay the minimum wage despite be on it they be be underpaid will he update the house on the government progress to ensure that all people on the minimum wage be pay the minimum wage my hon friend make very important point that those right be only as good as the ability of the government to enforce they as we know his majesty revenue and customs have very effective system to deliver on the minimum wage and we will shortly be release our late round of name and sham of those employer who have not do the right thing we hope that the fair work agency when it be establish will be even more effective at deliver fairness across the country and ensure that everyone get the minimum wage they deserve we know there be particular sector where there be acute challenge turn to the point make by the scottish national party spokesperson the hon member for dundee central chris law about the bill and cost of an year old be the same as those for an adult that be something absolutely understand it be why we change the low pay commission remit to ensure that we eventually get parity for that age group on the full adult rate it be also why we have change the remit of the low pay commission to move towards real living wage for all adult we understand that that be such an important thing for we to deliver on he may feel that we be not quite there yet and we must ensure we take evidence as we go along from business on how it impact on particular sector and particular part of society but to year old be get pay rise this year as result of the regulation that be something be sure he will welcome my hon friend the member for newton aycliffe and spennymoor alan strickland raise very well the regional impact of the wage increase in his part of the world it be the case that the regulation will mean worker in the north east or of the total workforce in that region will benefit from the increase we should all be absolutely delighted about that my hon friend the member for kettering rosie wrighting also raise in work poverty that be why the remit be be change we want to ensure that in work poverty be consign to the history book my hon friend the member for hendon david pinto duschinsky set out in stark term the figure associate with the regulation may mention they again at some point before finish they be the bold number that will go directly into people pocket and that we can show as tangible proof of labour government deliver for work people my hon friend also raise the matter of the empty opposition benches do not want to equate that with meaning that the conservatives do not support these increase as think the shadow minister the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin say that they do do put she on notice though that her party leader have be less than full in her support for the minimum wage so hope that the shadow minister support for today measure have not damage her career prospect it may well be that there be another leader in few month anyway and that thing will be look up we do hope that the conservatives continue to support the minimum wage as we move forward and that they do not change tack now that they have enter opposition however the shadow minister do raise number of important question which will now try to address she raise the impact on public sector worker of course pay for most frontline worker be set through pay review body process which do take account of national living wage increase as part of their process we do not believe that many public sector worker will be directly affect by this change but it be something the departments will take into account when they set their budget the shadow minister also ask about the cumulative impact of the change the impact assessment do show that this year uprating will represent increase in the uk wide wage bill which think be incredibly good value for what we be deliver into people pocket of course the total impact of the employment rights bill be at most of the total wage bill the hon lady raise question about burden on sme the low pay commission do take into account the impact on business as part of its operation it look at the competitiveness of individual business the labour market and the wide economy draw on extensive labour market pay analysis and stakeholder evidence when recommend rate and we would expect the commission to do exactly the same next year small business have of course have support from this government we have increase the employment allowance from to mean that employer will pay no national insurance contribution at all and more than half of employer will gain or see no change from this measure we have also extend business rate relief for the retail hospitality and leisure sector the hon lady raise concern about the impact of the measure on young people the youth guarantee will ensure that every young person have access to education or training to help they to find job and we be transform the apprenticeship levy to ensure that young people get the opportunity they deserve the shadow minister raise concern about the overall labour market would just make the point that payroll employment be actually high now than it be this time last year and the late labour force survey last week show record number of people in work perhaps the negative headline that we have be see be not actually the reality of the situation like to deal with fact madam deputy speaker and the fact be that these regulation will put more money into the pocket of worker around the country around worker in scotland worker in northern ireland and worker in wales this will make real difference to people for full time worker and for someone on the rate this be truly worthwhile exercise and we thank the low pay commission for its work as well as hmrc which enforce on behalf of the department and acas which offer impartial advice and expertise to ensure that workplace dispute can be resolve and worker right can be uphold this be meaningful change be deliver by this government that deliver powerful message this government and indeed this parliament be commit to make work pay these real term increase to the minimum wage will end insecurity at work commend these regulation to

veterinary products in waterways motion make and question propose that this house do now kitchen be delighted to secure my first adjournment debate and for it to be about veterinary product in waterway specifically neonicotinoids such as fipronil and imidacloprid from now on for your sake and mine madam deputy speaker shall be refer to these neonicotinoid as neonics have be extremely keen to secure debate on this matter for some time now have have it raise with before the general election by constituent ueli zellweger who be vet it be high time that we give this topic the scrutiny that it so desperately need we be nation of pet lover it be estimate that there be around million cat and dog in the uk speak as doting dog and cat owner myself and know that our furry friend be an integral part of million of british family and so when flea and tick come bite bring discomfort and annoyance to our beloved pet we of course want to act swiftly and efficiently to alleviate their suffering flea treatment product contain fipronil and imidacloprid be see as highly convenient and effective way of deal with the problem cause by flea and tick in the uk imperial college london claim that fipronil be an ingredient in different pet anti flea and tick treatment with imidacloprid authorise in some veterinary product however this convenience come at cost to our waterway and associated ecosystem popular though these product be safe they be not these two ingredient be extremely toxic they be very powerful killer indeed and the picture be not pretty in fact so powerful be these chemical that just one drop of fipronil have the potency to wipe out bee as well as cause serious neurological damage and hamper the mobility of thousand upon thousand more as well as this accord to extensive research conduct by imperial college london one monthly flea treatment for large dog contain enough imidacloprid to kill staggering million bee the decline in pollinator population which in part can be attribute to the use of imidacloprid threaten agricultural productivity and have very serious long term implication for our national food security this be not simply mere triviality to be neglect authority have recognise the toxicity level and the hideous harm that these chemical can cause on the natural world since fipronil have be ban in agricultural use and imidacloprid have be ban since but give the unregulated nature of these chemical in relation to flea product we be allow these product into our environment through the back door and our aquatic and nearby ecosystem be pay the price there be not just one route for these neonic to enter our british waterway it be important to be aware of all the various pathway towards this pollution the most obvious and most direct be simply the contact of pet with water body themselves if dog go swim in river after receive their course of treatment the product be then introduce into the waterway allow it to enter our river lake and stream and go wherever the water take it wreak havoc as it travel dissemination can also occur because of rainwater run off with residual product wash off from treat animal into drainage system and end up in our waterway equally the washing of pet bed and even pet owner hand be think to be common way in which these dangerous product enter our waterway there be some less direct pathway that still pose problem and at this point must apologise to those currently eat their supper these product be generally harmless to our dog and cat but they can be absorb by our four legged friend once absorb the product can be excrete and even when responsible owner clean up after their pet something that be not universal unfortunately the trace of fipronil and imidacloprid leave behind can still prove incredibly damaging once wash into our waterway study have reveal that imidacloprid be one of the most frequently detect pesticide in dog urine but the level be still comparatively low with the national office of animal health finding that only around of topically apply fipronil be systematically absorb the shedding of treat hair or skin can also lead to pathway be create once these product be in our waterway not only be they utterly deadly for the thousand of native aquatic organism in the uk but they be highly toxic to sea and freshwater fish even at low concentration fipronil can be disruptive to aquatic life cycle river sample datum gather by the uk environment agency over the course of two year period between and from different waterway in england discover fipronil residue in of freshwater sample and trace of imidacloprid in of all sample beyond the effect on our waterway other study have find fipronil to be incredibly toxic to bird it bring no joy to report that this be not just an aquatic problem indeed through process of collect different bird nest researcher find that every single one without exception contain fipronil and an overwhelming majority have significant remnant of imidacloprid the truth be that the decline in aquatic insect that emanate from the flowing of these product in our waterway affect fish population who rely on these insect as primary food source this in turn impact bird specie that prey on fish produce dangerous snowball effect that reverberate throughout the ecosystem this deterioration of biodiversity greatly diminish the overall resilience of our ecosystem expose vulnerability to factor of climate change and invasive specie one of the most troubling aspect of the like of fipronil and imidacloprid be their persistence in the environment the chemical disintegrate slowly and can remain in soil and waterway for extensive period of time in the case of imidacloprid scientist say that the residual effect last in soil for month sometimes even year and the breakdown product of these chemical be understand to be even more toxic than the parent compound do the hon member agree that some pet owner may not be aware of how bad this issue be and so packaging usage guidance and point of sale advice for pet treatment should give some warning of the danger that the product could affect aquatic life if it ever enter watercourse be come on to that later but the hon member be absolutely right it be also important to note that the economic cost of mitigate the environmental and health impact of these chemical be substantial would the hon lady give way with pleasure and happy birthday commend the hon lady on bring this issue forward she be right to outline the problem with fipronil and what it can do to our water but there be many other thing that can affect water northern ireland water go around all the farm provide free service collect herbicide weed killer sheep dip insecticide spray rodenticide fungicide spray veterinary medicine and empty container take all those thing out of the country and away from the waterway and we can make our water clean this issue be not just about the specific chemical that the hon lady mention there be many other thing that need to be remove as well do she agree with that thank the hon member for his interesting intervention agree and will talk about farmer in particular in moment it be also important to note that the economic cost of mitigate the environmental and health impact of these chemical be substantial water bill be set to rise precipitously this year cause pain to the average consumer in tiverton and minehead rise of and have be announce by the two water company that supply we purifying contaminate waterway and restore the ecosystem blight by those chemical require significant financial resource place burden on community and strain local government purse how much of that financial impact be reflect in these bill rise be consumer face price rise in their water bill because we be not effectively regulate problem product such as neonic we know that there be an issue with our water quality the issue at dunster beach and blue anchor in my constituency spring to mind that be why the government pass the water special measures act and why my party leader fall into windermere several time during the general election campaign to raise awareness when will we clean up our act and put in place the firm restriction on these pollute water company when will we look at what we can do to stop other pollutant from get anywhere near our waterway in the first place will be interested to hear from the minister whether this cost have be factor into the government think on this issue and whether there could be some answer to the question have pose on broad note will touch on how we can help our farmer and those in our rural community with these environmental challenge our waterway make up key part of our natural biodiversity but each part rely on the other that make the recent decision to axe the sustainable farming incentive scheme all the more worrying and damaging to our rural community if there be not the money for sustainable farming agricultural practice will naturally follow economic sense if not the careful environmental custodianship on which our farmer pride themselves farmer be suffer at the hand of this government and with they so suffer our environment will the minister take this opportunity to reassure the house that her colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs be do everything they can to support our farmer as they balance the agricultural and environmental need of the land will she also ensure that due consideration be give to the restoration of the sfi scheme so that we can keep make progress on our environmental goal hand in hand with farmer and not be distract from the harm of damage product such as the neonic that have be talk about by lose our much need local and rural ally be aware that this speech have be slightly doom and gloom but will now turn to what we can do as an alternative research have show that the like of coconut oil citronella oil good old lavender and eucalyptus provide good natural and most importantly non toxic alternative for flea and tick repellent the market be awash with collar for cat and dog infuse with these essential oil which be both practical and natural there have be very little emphasis on these solution we should be do much more to promote the benefit of these chemical free remedy as see in recent development in switzerland where the government be carry out water testing there be clear need for environmental impact assessment of the use of fipronil and imidacloprid these should be launch as matter of urgency and would welcome the minister reflection on this point we liberal democrats have call for any emergency authorisation of neonic to be revoke and for the introduction of tight restriction on their use invite the minister to comment on the state of play and whether there be serious appetite in the government to address this issue it be clear that we have serious challenge on our hand as the hon member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham say these product be advertise widely and sell ubiquitously be not blind to the fact that these product have bring undeniable benefit in pest control but their unintended consequence serve as stark reminder of the need for sustainable and nature friendly practice genuinely believe that there be desire to do more to regulate these highly toxic chemical lawmaker be right to impose blanket ban on fipronil and imidacloprid in agricultural setting in and the will should be there to ensure that these product can not be allow to continue damage our freshwater ecosystem further regulation be the only way forward to remove harmful contaminant and arrest the degradation of aquatic fauna in this country waterway the government also need to go far and fast in regulate our waterway and the water company damage they overall the water special measures act be good first step but the government can and must do more ofwat be fail in its duty the time have come for new clean water authority to replace it as we up our game in protect our precious waterway see no reason why reform design to keep neonic out of our waterway can not come hand in hand with our push to keep sewage and other contaminant and pollutant out of our waterway in the short term for neonic restriction should be place on the trade of fipronil and imidacloprid with the only exception to their continue use come under strict condition of prescription only by veterinary medical professional and for limited time period we know that amazon and the over the counter market in pet store can lead to the propagation of those product in our natural environment so restriction would make some sense when the time allow ban for all other usage should certainly be in the government scope it be clear that decisive action must be take on this matter could the minister shed some light on whether the government would be willing to assess the potential merit of move in that direction from all that have see that appear the prudent and perhaps only direction to take it be as always pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker congratulate the hon member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour on secure the debate and especially congratulate she on her first adjournment debate in the house be sure that it will be the first of many and probably the first of many regard water so we might get use to see each other on such evening obviously we can not miss the opportunity to congratulate the hon member for strangford jim shannon on his birthday be sure that speak for the entire house when say that hope he have have wonderful day an adjournment debate would not be the same without he so thank he for join we even on his birthday know that the government have carry out monitoring in the tiverton and minehead area to deliver programme such as update the water framework directive status natural capital ecosystem assessment and catchment sensitive farming as hon member know the quality of our river lake and sea be essential for support our ecosystem provide clean water and produce our food our beautiful river lake sea and beach be source of pride for our community and we want to restore they to that end totally agree that we be nation of pet lover again have to mention my three wonderful cat never miss the opportunity to mention they who be meglatron lily and serena serena be give that name because she be such beautifully serene lady and meglatron because he be crazy little boy we have run around the house all the time the hon lady be quite right and be sure that the concern about flea and tick be feel by many pet owner up and down the country on our wide neonic work on march just four day ago we release the national action plan on pesticide it have three objective to encourage the take up of integrated management to establish timeline and target for the reduction of the use of pesticide and to strengthen compliance to ensure safety and well environmental outcome can you believe madam deputy speaker that the nap which we publish just last friday we put out the write ministerial statement on monday have be wait over decade under the previous government we manage to get it out in eight month be quite proud of that on our wide work on neonic before christmas we make write ministerial statement talk about how we want to ensure complete ban in the use of the emergency authorisation the hon lady will know that decline this year emergency authorisation for the use of cruiser pesticide that demonstrate the government commitment to tackle some of the concern that be widely hold the quality of our water be of course essential for support ecosystem provide clean drinking water and produce our food maintain healthy and clean water source be vital to achieve the government mission for sustainable economic growth but the public be also concerned about chemical use for the treatment and prevention of flea and tick for pet in uk waterway the government be commit to understand the impact of veterinary medicine enter our environment speak more widely about water quality the flawed water system that the government inherit be still discharge record level of sewage into our river lake and sea the situation be not just an environmental failure it be also public health crisis demand our immediate and decisive action to rectify decade of neglect and mismanagement we need systematic approach to tackle issue that impact the whole of the drainage and waste water system stop the unnecessary pressure from rainwater and sewage misuse enter the system to the point at which it be discharge into the environment as mention the water special measures act gain royal assent on february boost the power of water sector regulator to tackle pollution that major legislation deliver on this government promise to clean up the water sector and be the most significant increase in enforcement power for water industry regulator in decade the act will give regulator new power to take tough and fast action to crack down on water company damage the environment and fail their customer however we do not just want to give that oh no we want to do so much more further legislation aim at fundamentally transform how our entire water system operate will be guide by the finding of the independent water commission lead by sir jon cunliffe which be currently conduct the large review of the industry since privatisation also mention the wonderful start to the day have today because early this morning at meet sir steve redgrave and lot of young rower from the university of reading to discuss how we can improve our water quality for the river and lake that we all love it be pleasure to have cup of coffee with he very early this morning and talk about our shared ambition to clean up our river have speak about the importance of water quality will turn in detail to the topic of veterinary medicine in waterway the government recognise the presence of parasiticide nearly get away with that in the wide environment as significant concern and we be actively gather evidence on that complex multifactorial issue all veterinary medicine undergo rigorous scientific assessment before approval as the regulator for veterinary medicine the veterinary medicines directorate balance the benefit of veterinary medicine for animal health and welfare as well as human health protection against the associate risk which obviously include environmental risk medicine be only ever authorise if the benefit outweigh the risk the vmd follow internationally recognise guideline for assess the environmental risk of veterinary medicine for all animal include pet flea and tick can lead to as mention discomfort and distress in pet those parasite can host microbe that cause disease in pet and potentially in pet owner who encounter the flea and tick topical flea treatment play crucial role in protect both animal and human health from flea tick and disease it be therefore essential that we take balanced approach to the benefit of such treatment and their potential environmental impact when consider the issue while there be evidence of the presence of fipronil and imidacloprid in fresh water it be well establish that as insecticide these substance be inherently toxic to invertebrate and we do not understand the effect that current level be have at population and ecosystem level we be however commit to understand the potential impact of veterinary medicine enter the environment the vmd have lead on the formation of cross government group on pharmaceutical in the environment to develop co ordinate strategy to reduce the impact of the substance in the environment the group include key governmental body include the environment agency the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency the health and safety executive and representative from the devolved government while the vmd be prioritise the development of an evidence base work to resolve the issue will require involvement by all key stakeholder include the pharmaceutical industry and veterinary professional the work do not come without challenge and stakeholder remain divided on the way forward some advocate for the benefit of year round parasiticide use for human and animal health other emphasise the need for more cautious use while some push for complete ban any decision to limit use must be carefully weigh against the benefit to ensure balanced approach as restriction could impact animal welfare animal health and even public health also there be still critical evidence gap in understand the full impact of those option on both animal and human health as well as on the environment and that must be explore far before any regulatory action be take rise rise will give way to the hon lady on the liberal democrat bench and then to my hon friend could the minister just clarify whether that group will consider the benefit of use natural remedy or combination of natural remedy and of ensure that people be fully aware of the benefit of that and that that will be in some way quantify as my hon friend the member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour mention during her speech yes we be go to look at all the evidence on the available option as say there be difference of opinion over the good way forward people have different view on that it be my job as we be responsible government to look at all the evidence and try to find balanced way forward so that will be include as part of the evidence base be there rough timeline for that group to come back with report my hon friend be always very dedicated to defra relate issue and it be always nice to see she here will check to see whether can give she more detailed decision on timing if can not do so in this meeting will ensure that let she know afterwards as say the vmd be develop the evidence base and have commission scientific research to investigate how these substance reach river and stream it be work closely with stakeholder to collect datum and address the issue it be support call for review of the internationally agree environmental risk assessment standard the vmd and the environment agency be work closely together to understand the risk pose by these chemical and to respond appropriately to far address this issue the group on pharmaceutical in the environment have develop road map for reduce level of two veterinary substance in uk surface water the priority for this road map be to raise awareness and improve pet owner education on risk and appropriate use know that point have come up here once finalise that road map would be available to all stakeholder as unresearched policy can fail badly any change we implement must be evidence base and measurable to achieve success this government will not turn the other way or continue to allow our river lake and sea to be pollute through the water special measures act the independent water commission future legislation and many other action we be demonstrate our commitment to comprehensive reset of the water industry and will drive long term transformative change we remain dedicated to address the environmental impact of veterinary medicine and will continue work with relevant stakeholder to find solution that protect both animal health and the environment again congratulate the hon member for tiverton and minehead on secure the debate the public want clean water and we be determined to deliver it question put and agree to house adjourn
