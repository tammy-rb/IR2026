be change that include member of course but importantly it also include the staff who support they and the resident they serve have look at sir david amess plaque during prayer also wish everyone very safe campaign we be commit to support local medium as vital pillar of our local democracy our digital markets competition and consumers bill will among many other measure help to rebalance the relationship between local publisher and online platform in addition the media bill which hope will be pass include measure to help radio to provide high quality local journalism we have also support local press through tax relief and innovation funding the slough observer the slough express bbc radio berkshire asian star radio and other such local medium outlet be the glue that bind and build our slough community hold to account local councillor mp and official and place local focus on national issue however the tories have neglect local news in the cairncross review highlight the serious challenge face local journalism but to date the government have take no significant action their lack of support couple with low wage and job insecurity be force talented journalist out of local news what step have minister take to ensure that job in local journalism be viable since we be do some name check let pay tribute to the havering daily time fm and the romford recorder think the hon gentleman must have miss the digital markets act and the key recommendation of the cairncross review which identify the lack of balance in the relationship between publisher and dominant platform we bring that recommendation to the house and it be pass that be our main effort to protect local journalism but of course it be not our only effort we also provide business tax relief for local journalism office we support the bbc local democracy report scheme we have protect public notice income we be look at how we use government advertising spend and we be speak to the team about what else we can do this seem to be an appropriate moment to acknowledge that in orkney and shetland we be bless with some very good quality local medium the orcadian the shetland times shetland news sibc bbc radio orkney and bbc radio shetland if have forget anyone will doubtless suffer for it in the week to come for community such as ours strong local medium presence be an important bulwark against the relentless centralisation of control power and government in edinburgh which be why we need to protect our medium do the minister agree that what we really need be coherent strategy for all aspect of local medium include advertising to ensure that local medium outlet remain strong certainly agree and we have be put forward that strategy but it be very dynamic market we be now see challenge to local reporting from artificial intelligence and we be consider how we can protect some of these publication because we agree that they be such an important part of our local democracy if any other member want to bob on this question and name check their local medium shall be happy to pay fulsome tribute to their journalist the minister must have guess that mention of the torbay weekly which be launch four year ago under its editor jim parker would be come in this supplementary question on more serious note one of the worrying trend we have see be the way that national corporation will buy historic local title turn it into weekly and run into the ground even when such corporation close down newspaper they refuse to release the title so that it can perhaps be use by local group that be try to put together multimedia platform to continue local accountability what step could the government take to resolve that there be surely no great publication in my hon friend constituency than the torbay weekly should also say that this house have make it clear just how strongly it feel about bbc local radio service in the course of this parliament and hope to see they protect in the next parliament he be absolutely right about the challenge of publication be buy up we want to support some of the microsite and we be look at how we can use government advertising spend to try to help support they in the spirit of one upmanship would just like to announce that mr speaker do not read the financial times or listen to radio no he read the bolton news and listen to bolton fm we be very disappointed at the weekend because we lose to oxford united speak to keith harris from bolton fm this morning and he want assurance that the government will do all they can to ensure that local radio be an essential tool for democracy that it get the legal support it need and that government both locally and nationally can do more to support local platform on point of clarification read the chorley guardian and the lancashire evening post would definitely still be listen as peter kay would say to chorley fm come all over the bolton news bolton fm and the chorley guardian we could not live without they my hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of local radio as media minister fight hard to make sure that we include provision for local radio in the media bill and very much hope that it will be pass in the wash up horserace what step her department be take to support the horseracing industry give that my constituency of pudsey will no long exist after the election

ask hundred from the back benches pay tribute to my right hon friend who have be an exemplary minister and representative of pudsey it be perhaps fitting that my final question be about horserace which be at the heart of the west suffolk constituency and of course newmarket it require significant support in these difficult time know that the minister and the secretary of state have be work incredibly hard to try to settle the late levy negotiation can he assure that he will do everything he possibly can to use the last few day in which this parliament be sit to get that deal over the line we now want certainty to be able to take this great sport from strength to strength think that be valedictory speech my right hon friend have certainly be an advocate of and hard campaigner for horseracing and not just in his constituency but for the wide sport significant progress have be make on increase levy contribution on voluntary basis and great deal of thank must go to the british horseracing authority the betting and gaming council and dcms official for all their effort and engagement throughout this process with an offer on the table we urge both side to agree on the term of the deal which will see increase investment in the sport allow it to grow and secure its sustainability we will do everything we can to ensure that be agree thank the minister for that answer the last autumn winter and spring have see deluge of rain like we have never see many of we be either go to buy boat or build one what assessment have be make of the impact of the past month of increase

labour government in wales have reduce their funding to the arts council of wales by and have be call out by those in wales so be very grateful to the hon member for give the opportunity to point that out call the shadow secretary of state can the secretary of state or anyone else on the tory benches honestly tell the young people in bristol and across the uk that they be well off after year of

her watch the gender activity gap be wide than ever few girl than boy take part in team sport do she agree that it be only under labour the party of equality that woman and girl in bristol and beyond

rich tradition of music and the art huddersfield my constituency have the huddersfield choral brass band so many centre of excellence and an international festival of music could we have special money

significant amount of that money in music the hon gentleman do not mention the rugby league result on sunday public accounts commission the hon member for south norfolk the chairman of the public accounts commission be ask artificial intelligence government if he will make an assessment of the adequacy of national audit office resource to scrutinise the cost of ai in government the national audit office do have adequate resource to scrutinise the cost of artificial intelligence and indeed produce report in march that find that ai present government with significant opportunity to transform public service and that the government have identify that artificial intelligence could deliver substantial productivity gain potentially worth billion my hon friend have identify the report in which be interested that report as he rightly say note the importance of artificial intelligence in deliver transformational public service but also note number of challenge in the die ember of this parliament would he be willing to leave message for the next chair of the public accounts committee urge that an inquiry be carry out into that report as believe its finding be of considerable importance my right hon friend be absolutely right that it be an important subject and the public accounts committee be due to take oral evidence on it on june will certainly draw his concern to the attention of the new chair of the public accounts committee when know who he or she be thank the hon gentleman for his response this be massive subject and will have to be scrutinise greatly in the next term of government what assessment have be make of the potential negative of ai within the defence industry and government and what step will be take to combat they think the short answer be that there be inadequate awareness inside government although there be some awareness that there be potentially very large negative with artificial intelligence indeed one of the inventor of artificial intelligence have write book on precisely that subject suspect that it be something the government will continue to assess nhs procurement if he will make an assessment of the adequacy of national audit office resource to undertake analysis on the efficiency and effectiveness of nhs procurement in its january report the national audit office establish that the nhs supply chain have great potential to secure further saving by aggregate the nhs spending power but that so far it have not fulfil that potential in its january report on the nhs supply chain the national audit office make seven recommendation to improve the efficiency of the nhs billion annual procurement programme include the need to improve price and make ordering as straightforward as possible the national audit office report twice year on whether department have implement its recommendation so will it use that mechanism to monitor the progress of the nhs supply chain be sure the comptroller and auditor general and his staff at the national audit office will want to listen very carefully to what my hon friend have say although must tell he that the inability of the nhs to use its huge spending power more successfully on behalf of taxpayer and patient have be hardy perennial throughout my entire year in parliament while wish he well in his endeavour would advise he not to hold his breath it be little know fact that from to be member of the public accounts committee really enjoy that experience this be one of my last question in this house after nearly year here can we do more to show incoming member of parliament how powerful body the public accounts committee be and what an amazing resource it be for members of parliament in get inquiry look at funding and look at the wise spending of government could we have programme again perhaps there could be note on the desk to teach new member how important this national treasure be have spend year on the public accounts committee completely agree with what the hon gentleman say it be in my view one of the good place to spend one time as parliamentarian check that our constituent money as taxpayer be safeguard and well look after by whichever government of the day happen temporarily to be in office commend what he have say to everyone church commissioners the hon member for south west bedfordshire represent the church commissioners be ask affordable and sustainable housing whether the church of england be take step to provide affordable and sustainable housing on its land can tell my hon friend that the church commissioners be bring forward substantial new amount of housing across england include affordable home in accordance with local planning policy in the area concern where the commissioner be able to we also seek to go far for example through the use of rural exception site to provide high proportion of affordable housing than the local plan require thank my hon friend for his response but give that affordable housing be such concern across north devon can the church do any more to assist know what great champion my hon friend be on this issue unfortunately the church commissioners themselves do not have any land in north devon that be be consider for housing at the moment but will put she in touch with the diocese of exeter to see whether it have opportunity in its own land portfolio as say know what big issue this be in north devon and how important it be for my hon friend who have be work on it passionately so we will do what we can to help diocesan support interregnums what recent assessment the church of england have make of the adequacy of the support offer by diocese to parish in an interregnum during an interregnum diocese will usually arrange for clergy in neighbouring parish and across the local deanery to take service and to be available to support the church warden and the parochial church council it be important that those local volunteer be well support during an interregnum when they lack the visible and present leadership of parish priest my hon friend will know that the combined parish of st paul and christ church serve large part of paignton but be currently in interregnum as he outline during interregnum lie minister and church warden have to step forward what extra support do the church make available to they when they do so it be typical of my hon friend to take this level of interest in his clergy and church as know he do regularly can tell he that the diocese of exeter have produce guide to help church warden and the parochial church council and duty of pastoral care be clearly owe to all those who keep the church go in the absence of minister the good help that christ church and st paul paignton can receive be for that vacancy to be really well advertise have do bit of research on that church can see that the new incumbent would inherit dynamic worshipping congregation on the beautiful english riviera be pleased to be able to provide some free advertising for that tremendous opportunity hope that parish priest look for an exciting new opportunity will be flock to christ church and st paul paignton to take up that one educational attainment church schools what recent assessment the church of england have make of the impact of church school on the level of educational attainment in cleethorpes

pensions if he will make statement on the equality and human rights commission investigation into the treatment of disabled people on benefit it be pleasure to be call to the dispatch box to respond for the department for work and pensions this morning the department be absolutely committed to provide service through which every customer include disabled people and our most vulnerable claimant

be that both the ehrc and the dwp be still bind by confidentiality we be seek further clarity on what we can share so will not discuss those negotiation far while do not believe an investigation be necessary we at the department do of course take the ehrc concern seriously we welcome the focus now provide in the term of reference we will work constructively with the commission in its investigation to well understand its concern hope the investigation will provide deep insight into some of the most complex case that the department deal with of course if any improvement be identify by the commission we will rightly take step to address they thank the minister for her answer have great respect for she but if she be tell the house that the government have be in negotiation with the ehrc for three year and this be where we be now that be ridiculous and absolutely underline what many in this house include myself have be say to the government for more than three year the scottish national party have be challenge the government over their treatment of those with illness or disability and therefore we welcome this overdue investigation by the ehrc full transparency and accountability be imperative so that the mistake of the past be never repeat we know about that from all the other investigation that have be take place recently if it do transpire that either the dwp or the secretary of state or both have breach equality law the strong possible action must be take it be the least those who have suffer at the hand of this government deserve have speak over the year to many disability organisation and they be appal at how disabled people be treat as be the united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities rapporteur have conclude that the uk government have fail to take all appropriate measure to address grave and systematic violation of the human right of person with disability that be further black mark against this government have say it time and again the uk government must change course from their cruel and demonising approach to disabled people and start support they in the way be do in scotland the word dignity fairness and respect mean something to disabled people in scotland the scottish social security system be design to treat people with dignity fairness and respect when on earth will this government or the likely follow labour government start do that in the uk it be an absolute and utter disgrace the propose welfare reform be dangerous and look to slash disabled people income during an ongoing cost of living crisis when disabled people be already face high living cost more people be be push into insecure and unsafe work and the government be undermine the principle of an extra cost benefit for disabled people now we have this ehrc investigation how can the minister possibly defend her government ongoing assault on disabled right just to cut cost agree with the hon lady we have much we agree about and real mutual respect and know her concern come from the heart reiterate that we be compassionate department welcome to all and we be keen to get insight and learning have give evidence on that most recently to the select committee make it clear that we be learn department focus on individual in fact our trauma inform approach be testament to that recently see that in hastings and it be be roll

wales and this give chance to pay tribute to she we have be try hard to understand tragic and complex case our sympathy be always with the family and we will continue those internal process review hope that the chairman of the select committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms will reflect on the useful evidence that be give we have grow number of visit officer for some of the most vulnerable we currently have and we have dedicated prison work coach want anybody watch study or read this urgent question to approach we and talk to we many people become involved with the dwp at the most challenging time of their life we be here to help people whether through our youth hub or our disability work coach please tell we what be go on we can link people to the right agency and we be determined to understand what the commission be think and feel and to work with it my hon friend the minister will be aware of the work that my select committee have do around the national disability strategy but specifically draw her attention to the word of the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson early this week nothing about without what reassurance can the minister give that disabled people will be fully include in the ongoing consultation on personal independence payment what reassurance can she give that she continue to work with disability confident to ensure that disabled people be enable to move into work and support when they be in work what reassurance can she give that the victim of contaminate blood sodium valproate primodo and mesh will not be subject to ongoing assessment year after year to make sure that they continue their entitlement to benefit what reassurance can she give that she agree that inclusion be not wokery and that include disabled people be crucial to ensure that their right be uphold be look forward to give evidence to my right hon friend on many of these matter alongside my hon friend the minister for employment indeed there be work to come forward on disability confident access to work the disability employment goal and much more point my right hon friend to action we have take include just this week there be the government back lilac review on disabled entrepreneur which be absolutely about listen to disabled people and have they at the heart of the conversation fantastic engagement on british sign language fully in bsl have be at the heart of that there have also be the pip consultation and the wide reform conversation we have also bring forward the buckland review my right hon friend be absolutely right about inclusion it work because when it be embed it be right for the bottom line of the business the organisation and the community it be not nice to do and it be not wake it be what we should be do call the opposition front bench spokesperson this be the first time in history that the equality and human rights commission have decide to investigate whether secretary of state have commit unlawful act by discriminate against disabled people as result of the way that the government have run the benefit system accord to report by the all party parliamentary group for health in all policy it may have lead to the death of vulnerable claimant by suicide and other cause yesterday appear before the work and pensions committee the secretary of state feign surprise at the equality and human rights commission take that unprecedented step yet he previously claim that he and his department be close to secure legally bind agreement to uphold disabled people right wonder what have change will the minister recognise the seriousness of her predicament and apologise to disabled people for her department obvious reluctance to engage meaningfully with the equality and human rights commission why have her department preside over benefit system that the commission believe could be unlawfully discriminate against disabled people will she take the opportunity to apologise to all those disabled people who have have their life tear apart by her department potentially illegal administration of the benefit system let first reflect on the secretary of state appearance at the select committee reiterate that as he say yesterday the investigation of the department be base on suspicion that something have occur that be not in and of itself conclusive proof the dwp rightly take its obligation under the equality act include the public sector equality duty incredibly seriously and will continue to co operate with the commission on its investigation hope that help the hon lady we want everyone in the dwp to be able to support customer in an appropriate manner accord to the individual need our mental health training and reasonable adjustment guidance help to empower our colleague by give they the skill to support every customer it have be the great privilege of my life to have be in the most amazing life change department for almost all of the last five year we be fully commit to listen to our customer and their representative about their need and to learn from they of course people will be concern about the ehrc response and the department be genuinely disappointed because we be constantly learn work be ongoing to strengthen guidance and training through continuous improvement activity our colleague be local people who live in their community they know their community and what people need whether people be come through the door be from local special school have be make redundant or have health condition dwp staff know those people and want to reassure they we will continue to give they the necessary tool and have confidence that our department will respond in the right way to our most vulnerable customer as depart this house as conservative mp thank you sir roger for your service and mentor over my year here will the minister make sure that in the response to the investigation those work in jobcentre and dwp office across the country be give the support that they need to do their job in west suffolk they do that job excellently brilliantly lead by julia nix who frankly deserve an honour it have be pleasure to work with those people when the minister consider the investigation will she look not only at physical disability include engagement with those who support wheelchair use but hide disability such as neurodivergent condition to the extent that they be disability and ensure that they be at the heart of the response welcome back my right hon friend from whom learn so much as parliamentary private secretary it be pleasing to know that his work on neurodiversity and understand other continue to be at the heart of what he bring to this house even in his last few moment here be recently at neurobox in cambridge where dyslexia need be discuss as well as the wide need in the labour market to learn about understanding and help people through the access to work scheme my right hon friend interest be mention there whether we be talk about the buckland review the lilac review on entrepreneurship which mention or partnership in community such as with julia nix who be stellar leader those message be important for those who only hear about the experience of the dwp through the mouth of those in this house urge people to go and see their local jobcentre this week there be recruit britain campaign back by employer to enable people to understand our jobcentre power to bring about change last week highlight to the minister report from the un committee on the rights of persons with disabilities that conclude that the uk have fail to take all appropriate measure to address grave and systematic violation of the right of people with disability she say that the uk government be commit to ensure that the uk be one of the good place to live and work as disabled person official report may vol do she really stand by that assertion give the serious concern raise by the equality and human rights commission do she understand why its chair say that they be extremely worried the ehrc also say that it believe that the dwp may have break equality law what do she have to say to the disabled people watch she must understand that it be clear demonstration that this tory government be content simply to disregard disabled people their right and their need if she disagree let she tell we specifically why thank the hon lady for her remark just this week meet people with disability in the media industry who be thrive while work in itv which try to help people when it come to wider will the minister answer my question be just try to meet company that be work to ensure that nhs building be more accessible so the dwp understand that the hon lady ask whether really believe that the uk could be the good place in which to be disabled person in term of accessibility and opportunity we be engage and learn in the context of change labour market and change need as for her early point we in the dwp want every customer to be support and we be commit to provide compassionate service for all we take our obligation under the equality act extremely seriously and that include the public sector equality duty we will of course continue to co operate with the commission investigation stand by my comment that we be disappointed to be in this position we often deal with tragic and complex case and our sympathy be always with the family concern we will continue to review and learn about process in order to understand well why the commission be take this action navigate the benefit system be difficult enough for able bodied people but for those who become disabled because of illness or accident it become virtual nightmare just at the point when they need the system the most also many employer concentrate on what people can not do rather than what they can do will my hon friend update the house on the work be do to ensure that people particularly those who suffer disability owe to illness or accident receive the benefit that they need at their time of great crisis we be roll out our workwell service and we have universal support as well fifteen integrate care system will pilot workwell the pilot will be locally design to fit local need and will be link to our exist work and health system work will be do throughout london be not sure whether that will include my hon friend part of london be sure that we will be able to let he know as mention my dad become disabled and be not use to navigate the benefit system that happen to many people many think that people be bear with disablement but it can be acquire as result of accident or incident the website give information about the benefit calculator and the citizens advice help to claim service and encourage people to see disability employment adviser my hon friend ask what more could be do notwithstanding the great support provide by programme such as access to work there be more that can be do but that safety net be there to protect people when they be at their most vulnerable whatever the reason disabled people confidence in the department be at terribly low ebb we be originally tell that these negotiation would be conclude within few month but in fact as the minister have tell we they drag on for three year and they fail the commission have tell that now that negotiation have end there be no restriction on what the department can say about what be happen during those negotiation at the very least we need some explanation from the department of why it have not be possible to reach an agreement can the minister give we that explanation now thank the chair of the select committee for his question as have say we will work constructively with the commission during its investigation in order to understand its concern well we be seek further clarity on what information we can share but until those conversation have end will not be in position to share any further information the secretary of state of course make his comment to the department but the permanent secretary tell the committee that the term of reference have be publish and we welcome that because it will give we clear sense of what the commission want to investigate we hope that deep insight into that very complex machine will allay some of the concern that the right hon gentleman have rightly identify and if there have be breach or improvement can be make we will of course address that the department be constantly learn and work be be do to strengthen guidance and training through continuous improvement activity the right hon gentleman mention confidence it be important that colleague and those with disablement feel confident that we have the necessary tool to help our most vulnerable claimant and of course we will take account of everything that the commission say be indebted to the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows for obtain today urgent question and she be correct to say that policy should be base on fairness dignity and respect in deal with case find that those with mental health condition include sporadic mental health condition be often unfairly sanction go through much deep stress and sometimes end up in desperate poverty as result in advance of the inquiry could the minister tell we what the department be do to ensure that the sanction regime against people with disability particularly those with mental health condition operate in much more respectful and inclusive manner that help they to deal with the horrible problem they be try to cope with the right hon gentleman make an important point about fluctuate condition and need which he be absolutely correct to identify we have grow number of visit and grow number of colleague with trauma inform approach and there be close engagement with wide safeguarding have trust relationship with one work coach job coach and disability employment adviser be so important and this be at the heart of our safeguarding protocol which be in place for healthcare professional who undertake assessment if they identify new condition or concern they will ensure that the individual healthcare team be aware and communicate directly with they again that be why we have the trauma inform approach recently see it be use at the hastings service centre where decision be make on child maintenance and at jobcentre the approach be be roll out in order to be at the heart of what we do in all the time have be in this house it be quite long time have never pick on civil servant or the people who deliver policy on the ground because be always remind that president harry truman have sign on his desk that say the buck stop here the buck stop here with the government but let reinforce point that be make early my constituent tell as chairman of the westminster commission on autism be sympathetic towards this that the staff they meet be good about physical disability but be not good when it come to neurodiversity people on the autism spectrum and people with little know mental health challenge can we give more training to the people who carry out assessment to make they more effective and efficient agree with the hon gentleman that the nature of disability and need have change which be what be try to draw out early different type of need be come our way we all know from our own constituency casework about the support that disabled people need in any realm and it be about understand the different need and appreciate that need change can assure he that the department work closely with healthcare assessor and have put in new process to allow personal independence payment to be pause when an appointment have already be schedule for example if we need to have additional information we be very aware that claimant need be different hence the buckland review of autism we know that huge number of autistic people be very keen to work but not enough of they do and this be at the heart of our understanding think the hon gentleman and share the same view on this issue the department will need to make change and develop its understanding and want to reassure the house that we come in the spirit of learning the minister be always compassionate and understand the issue as we can tell from the way she respond as often say however the benefit system lead to incredible frustration when those who be disabled have their application refuse they go to appeal the big issue in my office be benefit include appeal we have one staff member who do nothing else during the five and half day week that she work although we recognise that dwp staff do good job there need to be well understanding of how the system work when someone fill in their application there need to be well understanding of what it mean to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease osteoarthritis diabetes blood pressure problem back pain chronic pain those be the issue when we win of appeal it indicate that perhaps the first decision be not right thank the hon gentleman for the way he approach this matter it also give chance for all of we to thank our casework team who do so much and indeed all the staff across dwp they know that our customer vary they know that at time in their life they need additional support that be why we have those specialist service role and procedure in place from the dwp visit service to the advanced customer support senior leader we have the serious case panel review and we have the customer experience survey we be always listen and learning and there be continuous need to do that on fluctuate condition which other member have mention we have put well understanding of need and diagnosis at the heart of our engagement on reform and that be what disabled people have tell as well minister have have three year to reach basic agreement to ensure that the service that the department provide be accessible and do not discriminate against disabled people be it laziness incompetence or the chaos endemic across government that have result in the absolute failure to reach negotiation can the minister acknowledge that this failure have never be see in any other department before and represent under the equality act further demonstration of discrimination against disabled people the failure of the negotiation itself represent the problem reiterate to the house and to the hon gentleman that we take our obligation under the equality act incredibly seriously have speak about the change nature of condition understanding and learning and the public sector equality duty and we will continue to co operate and engage with the commission on its investigation as say we do not believe that an investigation be necessary but we do take its concern seriously undertake to the house that the department will be focus on those new term of reference so that we can work constructively with the commission in its investigation to well understand its concern interruption understand the concern of the hon member for east renfrewshire kirsten oswald who be chuntere again but reiterate to the hon member for bermondsey and old southwark neil coyle that we be very much determined to work with the commission as way forward agree that it be very disappointing that we have not be able to come to mutually agreeable position assure he that over the past five year this very large department which deal with many different area and complex case have put at the heart of what we do of which be extremely proud dedicated understanding of the individual and their need congratulate my hon friend the member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows on secure this urgent question and continue her fantastic work in this parliament on the right of disabled people also congratulate the equality and human rights commission on open this important investigation and on retain its grade status as national human right institution in the face of malicious attempt to undermine the work that it do for equality and human right for all work with many fantastic disability charity in my edinburgh south west constituency include health all round tiphereth and garvald but charity should not have to fill the huge gap leave by the government dereliction of their duty discrimination against disabled people be human right issue and that be something about which care passionately as the elect chair of parliament joint committee on human rights as we be about to go into general election period will the minister take the opportunity to give cast iron guarantee on behalf of her party that she will end discrimination against disabled people in the benefit system and end her government continue breach of disabled people human right appreciate that there be general election coming but when it come to the most vulnerable people this be not morning for politicking it be about be compassionate it be about understand disabled people right and it be about listen and learning we be focus on individual by work with the domestic abuse commissioner and through workwell universal support the national disability strategy the action plan and the trauma inform approach vitally as the hon and learn lady say it be about hear not just from disabled charity but from disabled people across the country to understand their need it be incredibly important that we take this seriously and we be determined that if the investigation under the term of reference give we deep insight into the concern have speak to the select committee about how the department deal with the most complex case we will take every step to address any improvement identify by the commission hope that give the hon and learn lady disabled people

spark large scale disinformation campaign fraud and scam future advance in advanced ai could also pose wide risk include labour market disruption and economic power imbalance and inequality the report also highlight that although various method exist for assess the risk pose by advanced ai model all have limitation as be common with scientific synthesis the report highlight lack of universal agreement among ai expert on range of topic include the state of current ai capability and how these could evolve over time the next iteration of the report will be publish ahead of the ai action summit early next year conclude the ai seoul summit country discuss the importance of support ai innovation and inclusivity which be at the core of the summit agenda we recognise the transformative benefit of ai for the public sector and commit to support an environment which nurture easy access to ai relate resource for sme start up and academia we also welcome the potential of ai to provide significant advance to resolve the world great challenge such as climate change global health and food and energy security the secretary of state and be grateful for the dedication and leadership show by the republic of korea in deliver successful summit in seoul just six short month after the world come together in bletchley park it be an important step forward but just as at bletchley we be only just get start the rapid pace of ai development leave we no time to rest on our laurel we must match that speed with our own effort if we be to grip the risk of this technology and seize the limitless benefit it can bring to people in britain and around the world the uk stand ready to work with france to ensure that the ai action summit continue the legacy that we begin in bletchley park and continue in seoul because this be not an opportunity we can afford to miss the potential upside of ai be simply immense but we can not forget that this be the most complex technology humanity have ever produce as the secretary of state say in seoul it be our responsibility to ensure that human wisdom keep pace with human knowledge commend the secretary of state and the prime minister for all the work they have do on the issue and commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister be grateful to the minister for advance sight of his statement hope this be in order mr deputy speaker because note that the minister for employment the hon member for bury st edmunds jo churchill be on the front bench and that she be not stand at the general election know she have be very cross with on occasion over the past few year she be probably still cross with now interruption as the minister say she be only human on personal note as we have both be cancer sufferer or survivor and have both have more than one rodeo on that it be sad that she be leave be sure she will continue to fight for patient with cancer and on many other issue and pay tribute to she it have be delight to work with she over these year hope she will forgive one day the economic opportunity for our country through artificial intelligence be of course outstanding with the right sense of mission and the right government we can make the most of this emerge technology to unlock transformative change in our economy our nhs and our public service let we just think of ai in medicine it be personal hope that it might soon be possible to have an ai app that can accurately assess whether mole on somebody back arm or leg or the back of their head be potential skin cancer such as melanoma that could definitely save life we could say exactly the same about the diagnosis of brain injury many other different kind of cancer and many other part of medicine there could be no more important issue to tackle but fear the government have fluff it again much as like the minister his statement could have be write by chatgpt have series of question first let ask about the share risk threshold for frontier ai development and deployment which the minister say government will be develop how will they be draw up what legal force will they have in the uk particularly if there be to be no legislation as still seem to be in the mind of the government secondly the secretary of state hail the voluntary agreement from the summit as success but do that mean company develop the most advanced ai be still mark their own homework despite the potential risk thirdly the minister refer several time to malicious actor which malicious actor be he refer to do that include state actor if so how be that work integrate with the cyber security strategy for the uk how will that be integrate with the cyber security strategy during the general election campaign fourthly the government own artificial intelligence adviser professor yoshua bengio to whom the minister refer have say that it be obvious that more regulatory measure will be need by which he mean regulation or legislation of some kind why therefore have the government not even take the step that the united states have take use president biden executive order next have the commitment make six month ago at the uk safety summit be keep or be these voluntary agreement just empty word moreover have the frontier ai company which take part in the bletchley summit share their model with the ai safety institute before deploy they as the prime minister pledge they would next the government press release state that china participate in person at the ai seoul summit so can the minister just clear up whether it sign the ministerial statement as the shadow minister for creative industry may ask why there be no representative of the creative industry at the ai summit why none at all despite the fact that this be billion industry in the uk and that many people in the creative industry be very concerned about the possibility the threat the danger and the risk associate with ai for remuneration of creator the code of practice working group which the government set up and which be aim at an entirely voluntary code of conduct have collapse so what be the plan now the government originally say that they would still consider legislation so be that still in their mind love this next phrase of the minister he say we be only just get start clearly somebody do not do any editing what on earth have take the government so long labour government would introduce bind regulation of the most powerful frontier ai company require they to report before they train model over capability threshold to conduct safety testing and evaluation and to maintain strong information security protection why have the government not bring forward any of those measure despite very strong advice from all of their adviser to do so finally do the minister agree that artificial intelligence be there for humanity and humanity be not there for artificial intelligence share the sentiment that the hon gentleman express about my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds jo churchill it be very sweet thing that he say the only sweet thing he have say from the dispatch box my hon friend have be great friend to give advice when become new father many people do not see the hard work that go into the pastoral care that happen here so be personally very grateful to she know that she be just about to leave the chamber so will let she do so just want to place on record my thank and gratitude to she be bit disappointed with the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant although have lot of time for he let first address the important matter of healthcare we obviously hugely focus on ai safety we have take world lead position on ai safety which be what the bletchley and the seoul declaration be all about ultimately the hon member final statement about ai be for humanity be absolutely right we will continue to work at pace to help build trust in ai because it can be transformative tool in number of different sphere whether it be in the public sector or in health as the hon member quite rightly point out on personal note hope that as cancer survivor he have the very good of health for long time to come early this week the prime minister speak about how ai can help in the way that breast cancer scan be look at often talk about brainomix which have be greatly helpful to nhs trust in the early identification of stroke that mean that three time more people be now live independently than be previously possible ai can also be use in other critical pathway clearly ai will be hugely important in the field of radiotherapy the national institute for health and care excellence have already recommend that ai technology be use in the nhs to help with the contouring of ct and mri scan and to plan radiotherapy treatment and external therapy for patient the nhs ai lab be set up in to accelerate the development and the deployment of safe ethical and effective ai in healthcare it be worth say that the hon member should not underestimate the complexity of this issue this year visit start up call aival which the government help to fund through innovate uk the success of the ai model vary depend on the different machine that be use and how they be calibrate so independent verification of the ai model and how they be employ in the health sector specifically be very important in term of malicious actor the hon member will understand that can not go into specific detail for obvious reason but assure he as someone who sit on the defend democracy taskforce lead by the security minister that we have be look at pace at how to protect our election be confident that we be prepared have take cross governmental approach include with our agency it be hugely important that we ensure that people can have trust in our democratic process the hon member be right that these be voluntary agreement be surprise by his response because we say clearly in our response to the white paper that we will keep the regulator lead approach which we have invest money in we have give million to ensure that the regulator increase its capability in whole sphere of area we have also say that we will not be afraid to legislate when the time be right that be key difference between what the opposition talk about and what we be do our plan be work whereas the opposition keep talk about legislate but can not tell we what they would legislate for we just tell you you should have listen there be no robust detail see that have exercise the hon member who be chuntere from sedentary position the opposition just have no serious plan for this the result speak for themselves around two week ago we have number of significant investment and significant amount of job creation in the uk with investment from coreweave and almost those on the opposition front bench would do well to listen to this we have billion of investment scale ai have put its headquarters in the uk that show our world lead position which be exactly why we co host the seoul summit and will support the french when they have their ai action summit it go to show the huge difference in our approach we see safety as an enabler of growth and innovation and that be exactly what we be do the work go on with the creative industry it be hugely important and we will not shy away from the most difficult challenge that ai present rise order before we proceed this conclude my last session in the chair for this parliament thank the house for the courtesy and understanding that have receive during my time as deputy speaker it have be hugely appreciate thank you all hear hear think the shadow minister be wise to draw attention to the potential benefit of ai in particular for health research and treatment notably brain injury subject in which he and share passionate interest but foolish if might say so to be churlish about the step that the government have already take the government deserve great credit for take lead on this internationally and establish the first organisation dedicate to ai safety in the world thank and congratulate the minister on that but in balance the advantage and risk the cost and benefit will he be clear that the real risk be underestimate the effect that ai may have the internet have already do immense damage despite the heady optimism at the time it be launch it have brutalise discourse and blur the distinction between truth and fiction and ai could go far to alter our very grasp of reality do not want to be apocalyptic but that be the territory that we be in and it require the most consider treatment if we be not to let those risk become nightmare completely agree with my right hon friend we recognise the risk and opportunity that ai present that be why we have try to balance safety and innovation refer he to the online safety act which be technology agnostic piece of legislation ai be cover by range of sphere where the act look at illegal harm so to speak he be right to say that this be about help humanity to move forward it be absolutely right that we should be conscious of the risk but be also keen to support our start up our innovative company and our exciting tech economy to do what they do well and move society forward that be why we have take this pro safety pro innovation approach repeat that safety in this field be an enabler of growth would like to thank sir roger gale who have just leave the chair he have be excellent in the chair and have very much enjoy his company as well as his chairing thank the government for advance sight of the statement my constituent and people across these island be concerned about the increase use of ai not least because of the lack of regulation in place around it have specific question in relation to the declaration and what be potentially come down the line with regulation who will own the datum that be gather who have responsibility for ensure its safety what be the minister do to ensure that regard be give to copyright and that intellectual property be protect for those people who have spend their time and energy and massive talent in create information research and artwork what be the impact of the use of ai on climate change for example it have be make clear that use this technology have an impact on the climate because of the intensive amount of electricity that it use be the government consider that will the minister ensure that in any regulation that come forward there be specific mention of ai harm for woman and girl particularly when it come to deepfake and that they and other group protect by the equality act be explicitly mention in any regulation or law that come forward around ai lastly we wait year for an online safety act it take very long time for we to get to the point of have regulation for online safety can the minister make commitment today that we will not have to wait so long for regulation rather than declaration in relation to ai the hon lady make some interesting point the thing about ai be not just the large language model but the speed and power of the computer system and the processing power behind they she talk about climate change and other significant issue we face as humanity that power to compute will be hugely important in predict how climate change evolve and weather system change be confident that ai will play huge part in that ai do not recognise border that be why the international collaboration and these summit be so important in bletchley we have country plus the european union sign the declaration we have really good attendance at the seoul summit as well with some really world lead declaration that will absolutely be important refer the hon lady to my early comment around copyright recognise the issue be important because it be core to build trust in ai and we will look at that she will understand that will not be make commitment at the dispatch box today for number of reason but be confident that we will get there that be why our approach in the white paper response have be well receive by the tech industry and ai the hon lady start with point about how constituent across the united kingdom be worried about ai that be why we all have to show leadership and reassure people that we be make advance on ai and do it safely that be why our ai safety institute be so important and why the network of ai safety institute that we have help to advise on and work with other country on will be so important in different country there will be nuance regard large language model and different thing that they will be approach and sheer capability will be huge factor pay tribute to the government for their approach on ai the growth of ai and its exponential impact have really not yet land with most people around the world the scale and impact of that technology be truly once in generation if not once in history ensure that we work around the world to harness that incredibly powerful force for good for humanity be vital it be good to see the uk play lead role in that and frankly it be good to see cross party approach because this be big than party politic will all those involve the minister lord camrose the secretary of state and the prime minister ensure that the agenda of empower the development of ai and put guardrail in place be absolutely at the centre not just of uk policy but of policy across the world put on record my personal thank to my right hon friend for all that he have do we work very closely together on the introduction of the integrate care board when he be health secretary and it continue to be hugely beneficial to my constituent he raise important point about the opportunity of ai and the building of trust which have also speak about however he mention cross party approach be not sure that the opposition be quite there yet in term of their approach say to the opposition that there be great tech story in this country we be now the third most valuable economy in the world worth over trillion we have more unicorn than france germany and sweden combine we have create million more job over more than at pre pandemic level and as have say just over billion of investment have come in just the last fortnight we believe in british entrepreneur british innovation and british start up the real question be why do the opposition not believe in britain welcome the minister statement he be right to say that many member across the chamber support the government clear goal and objective the continued focus on the bletchley declaration be to be welcome and welcome the drive to prevent disinformation and other concern however although information and practice sharing will be almost universal we must retain the ability to prevent the censorship of position that may not be popular but should not be censor and ensure that cyber security be priority for we nationally primarily follow by our international obligation the hon gentleman be absolutely right to say that ai will play huge role in cyber security we recently launch our code of practice for developer in the cyber security field ai will be the defining technology of the century it be hugely important and his question highlight exactly why we have take this approach we want our regulator which be close to their industry to define and be on top of what be go on that be why we have give they capacity build fund and ask they to set out their plan which they do at the end of april and we will continue to work with they it sound as if there be fair bit of discussion at the summit about ai in healthcare particularly on its use as medical device the minister will know that it have great potential and hear his exchange just moment ago to give just one example ai can support but not replace clinician in mammography reading do he agree that we must follow the strong lead of the us in this area by ensure that the regulatory landscape be in the right place to assist this innovation not get in the way of it my hon friend make hugely important point refer he to what say early it be insightful for to see how transformative ai can be in health when visit aival for example gain insight into the complexity of instal ai as testing bed for different machine depend on who have manufacture and calibrate they the regulator will play huge role as he can imagine whether on heart disease radiotherapy or deepmind work in develop alphafold congratulate the minister on all his enthusiastic work on ai in his statement he refer to the frontier ai safety commitment and company be mention one of those be zhipu ai of tsinghua daxue tsinghua university in china which be of course one of the four new ai tiger of china how important be the work that the minister be do to ensure china be keep in the tent when it come to the safety and regulation of ai so that we do not end up with balkanisation when it come to ai my hon friend make really important point will not try to pronounce the name of that university or that company what will say be that ai do not recognise border so it be really important for china to be in the room have those conversation what those company sign up to be world first by the way company from the us the united arab emirates china and of course the uk sign that commitment this be the first time that they have agree in write that they will not deploy or develop model that test the threshold those threshold will be divine at the ai action summit in france so my hon friend be exactly right that we need collaborative global approach thank the minister for his statement nhs with your permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement on this government work in the national health service first pay tribute to my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay have warn he that be go to refer to he and welcome he back to this place his magnificent question at prime minister question yesterday be an absolute tribute to he and to his family but also to the national health service which have do so much to put he back together my hon friend commitment to public service and dignity in the face of adversity be not only inspiring but an example to we all make this commitment to he as secretary of state be determined to change the prosthetics policy to support quadruple amputee such as he he make the point passionately and have hear he also want to reassure the victim of the infected blood scandal and their family that the general election that the prime minister call yesterday will in no way affect the process that be already under way throughout the election period government official and will continue to study the report to make sure that the lesson of sir brian inquiry be learn and that the mistake can never be repeat we will work with the nhs business services authority to make sure that everyone who be eligible receive the second interim payment of over the summer the report lay bare the many failing of successive government include historic failing in my own department as secretary of state apologise unreservedly for the action that have hurt and harm so many people and know there be consensus in this house that we will work together to ensure nothing like this scandal ever happen in our country again last update the house in january and would like to use this opportunity to share the step we have take since then to make our nhs fast simple and fair for patient and staff in we promise million more gp appointment year and thank to the hard work of our gps and their team we have deliver on that promise in january we go far by launch our pharmacy first programme which empower pharmacist to prescribe medication for seven common condition without the need to see gp the number of people use that programme be encouraging and when it be at full power million gp appointment will be free up in the face of industrial action we have reduce the nhs waiting list by more than

construction we have launch recovery plan for dentistry that will create million new nhs appointment this year alone that be be do by give dental practice extra cash for new patient they see introduce golden hello and deploy dental van to isolate rural and coastal community since launch our recovery plan more than additional practice have open their door to nhs patient today we be go far by publish consultation on introduce tie in for graduate dentist which will commit they to period of nhs work when they can hone their skill develop breadth of experience and give back to the people who help fund their training it cost the taxpayer up to to train dentist and we think it be right and fair to ask new graduate to use their new skill in the nhs ensure that the nhs work for woman be one of my priority and we have take number of step to support they we be open woman health hub across england we be help bereaved parent acknowledge their beloved baby with baby loss certificate and we have help half million woman to get cheap hormone replacement therapy we be also roll out new maternal mental health service for new mum which be already available in all but three local health system we be look to tackle condition that disproportionately affect the female population such as osteoporosis every year in england some fracture be suffer by people of work age the majority of whom be woman and many of they be entirely preventable have listen to the tireless campaigning of the royal osteoporosis society and the campaign of the express and the mail on sunday so today want to confirm that this government have the ambition to expand the use of fracture liaison service to every integrate care board in england and achieve coverage by have also make it my priority to protect our child who have be question their identity in ever increase number the cass review lay bare the damaging effect that social medium and degrading pornography have have on young people sense of self it also set out clearly the need for extreme caution in medical intervention today want to set out my clear intention to introduce ban order on puberty blocker with limited exception under section of the medicines act this be an extraordinary use of that power but it be the right use of that power because we must protect our child and young people from this risk to their safety we know that to make the nhs sustainable in the long term we need to work on prevention not just cure to drive this progress we need to embed prevention within the structure of the national health service and the government that be why we will be benchmarke identify and publish health service prevention spending to support investment in prevention nhs england and the department of health and social care will work closely with integrate care system to develop practical information and evidence that will aid local investment decision as secretary of state have see how prevention test across the nhs be not join up and want to make the nhs app the front door for prevention as well as for cure by people across england will be able to book vaccination for preventable disease include mmr measle mump and rubella and human papillomavirus on our app this move will make sure that million more people receive the vital vaccine we all need not just save they from life threaten condition but save the nhs money and resource in the long term we also have duty to give family the information they need to make healthy choice there have be lot of talk about the potential damage of ultra process food include in the press recently we want to cut through the noise and give people the fact that be why have ask our national institute for health and care research to gather evidence on the impact of ultra process food on health to help we support people to make informed and healthy choice in conclusion when it come to the nhs this government have record to be proud of we have more nurse million more gp appointment and million test check and scan at community diagnostic centre we have waiting list come down more dental appointment available well care for woman and more protection for vulnerable young people we have the first ever long term workforce plan and more doctor dentist and nurse than ever before we have clear plan and we be take bold action to build secure future for our national health service commend this statement to the house let start with few point of genuine consensus first associate myself and my party wholeheartedly with the right hon lady remark about the hon member for south thanet craig mackinlay and the extraordinary courage and strength he have show greatly welcome her reassurance to victim of the contaminated blood scandal and the emphasis she place on the cross party commitment to continue at pace to deliver justice whatever the outcome of the general election also welcome what she say about the justifiably cautious and responsible approach she be take in relation to puberty blocker in the light of the cass review that be the end of the consensus however because after year of conservative incompetence neglect and vandalism the national health service have never be in bad state the government cut gps and now it be impossible to get an appointment they waste billion of pound on top down reorganisation recruitment agency and crony contract for useless personal protective equipment instead of train the workforce the nhs need they force nurse out on strike for the first time in history and now the prime minister shamelessly try to blame they for his own failure send the country into an election with strike action still loom he promise to cut waiting list they be up to million even their claim that waiting list have fall in the last six month have be achieve only by exclude the community figure fiddle the figure he promise to build new hospital and the government have fail to build single one they hold people in this country in such contempt the conservatives think the public be so stupid that they will fall for the same recycled soggy promise all over again vast swathe of the country have be leave without single nhs dentist force people in britain in to perform diy dentistry on themselves after year the fundamental promise of the nhs have be break people can no long be sure the nhs will be there for they when they need it listen to the prime minister interview this morning it be clear he have give up on the nhs he have call this election with no plan to cut waiting list no plan to end the strike and no plan to reform the service the conservatives have take the nhs to breaking point if they be give five more year they will finish the job this election be the country chance to turn the page on year of failure to end the chaos in the nhs and to rebuild our nhs no part of our country be cry out louder for change than our health service not just investment but reform because if the nhs be to be there for we free at the point of use for the next year as it have be in the last it must change only labour can deliver that change our damp squib of prime minister be dripping into this election with puddle not plan in contrast labour have plan to get our nhs back on its foot and make it fit for the future interruption conservative members ask what it be give the people what they extra appointment week at evening and weekend to cut waiting list double the number of scanner with ai enable scanner diagnose patient fast emergency dental appointment and reform of the contract to rescue nhs dentistry double medical school place and train thousand more nurse gps and midwive deliver labour workforce plan bring back the family doctor so patient can see the same gp for each appointment mental health professional to treat people on time with mental health support in every school and hub in every community alongside landmark reform of the mental health act that be labour plan and that be just the start more than that unlike the conservatives we have record on the nhs to be proud of record of the short waiting list and the high patient satisfaction in history we do it before and we will do it again that be why representative of the nationalist party in wales and scotland know and even admit in private that labour government in westminster will be rise tide that lift all ship across our united kingdom say to people that it be not enough to send mps to westminster to oppose the conservatives they need to send labour mp to replace the conservatives if they be give five more year nothing will change the chaos will continue and the nhs crisis will get bad as we approach this general election be in no doubt the only way to deliver the change our country need be to vote labour have every hope that our country will do just that know that the hon gentleman have spend lot of time in recent day study that infamous pledge card it have obviously take up lot of space in his brain because he seem not to have understand that not only do we settle month ago with the consultant so they be not on strike but we have arrive at settlement with the specialty and specialist doctor which be go out to ballot he ask about junior doctor and he have obviously miss the news that we have just enter mediation with they we be bring together with the workforce plan the progress we be make on working condition the labour party do not like conversation about mediation no no no because we all know that labour mp be beholden to their trade union master and have never condemn single strike that have affect our constituent and their access to healthcare the hon gentleman ask about the new hospital programme and be wonder whether he would it be as some might say in politic bold have take the trouble it be lot of trouble to read the labour party health mission one of its pledge be that one of the first step of labour government would be to pause all capital project in the nhs our constituent should be clear the conservatives have new hospital programme which we be deliver the labour party have no new hospital programme the hon gentleman also talk about the idea for the nhs one he could not quite remember over the weekend and the number of appointment that labour would bring think it be appointment because when he be ask to clarify whether he mean appointment or treatment he could not define it hate to break it to he but there be difference between an appointment and for example triple heart bypass would love to know whether he be talk about appointment or treatment just to help he understand the scale of nhs england activity on weekly basis it provide out patient appointment week his pledge sound like big number but the truth be that it will not even touch the side even when labour have work out where the side be the hon gentleman also bravely talk about the cass review and genuinely welcome the fact that he have throw away his long hold principle and rely on the evidence that dr cass provide but wonder whether he ought to have conversation with his fellow shadow cabinet member because they announce policy this week that be self identification by the back door they want to put the responsibility for self identification and the gender recognition certificate process on the shoulder of our gps when we have be clear that we want our gps focus on the million more appointment they be make in the past year he do not forgive he be chuntere at and he need to go away and read the gender recognition act because it be panel that look after that process and labour be seek to change that to make it single gp the hon gentleman talk about the record of the conservative party and we be proud of it be particularly proud of the fact that we have record funding under the government for mental and physical health wonder whether he be quite so proud of the record in wales by the way labour run the nhs in wales wish have responsibility for wales but only have responsibility for england how be that go it be go well than it be in wales under the labour run nhs in wales quarter of people be on waiting list in that part of the nhs the number of patient wait two year be high in wales than it be in england patient be wait on average six week long in labour run wales than in england if that performance be replicate here in england waiting list could be as much as six million high the choice be clear unfunded labour failure or clear plan for more secure future with the conservatives call the chair of the health and social care committee record funding long term workforce plan finally in place and serious investment at last from the chancellor on health tech in the spring budget that be really welcome and record to be proud of as the secretary of state say but she will be aware that if demand continue to exceed supply we have problem my right hon friend tell we that she do indeed believe that prevention be the new cure so throughout the general election campaign and from here on as she continue as health secretary will she please bang on remorselessly about the big driver of ill health smoking alcohol addiction obesity poor housing and bad diet because remember we can only protect the nhs if we be healthy society thank my hon friend not just for his question which be excellent as always but for his long record in the house particularly in the world of healthcare he be superb minister in the department of health and have chair the select committee with great skill he have scrutinise many minister which promise he be not relax experience really pay credit to he may also thank my hon friend for highlight the importance of prevention we want to bend the demand curve on the nhs we know that demand have rise in recent year we be see more people in we be see more cancer referral and we be see more people access scan check and diagnostic and we need to help people to understand that we can take responsibility for our own health through work such as that on use the nhs app as gateway to prevention genuinely think that we will be help not only our generation but importantly young people who sometimes get forget in our conversation about healthcare welcome the commitment from the health secretary to pay the interim payment to those infect under the contaminated blood scandal but can say that there be no clarity at all from the government about the payment that sir brian recommend in april to those who have receive nothing so far the parent who have lose child and the child who have lose parent can seek guarantee from the health secretary that we will see psychological support service put in place in england immediately they be in place in northern ireland in scotland and in wales since ministers in the department have be say that those service would be make available that be four year ago it be not acceptable after the statement early this week by the prime minister and the paymaster general that be something that the nhs could do quickly and which would have enormous impact especially because with the general election have be call people do not quite know what will happen to the government promise thank the right hon lady for all her work she may recall that when the inquiry be announce by the then prime minister my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may we have debate on that matter where speak as back bencher on behalf of constituent very much hope that he and other gain some reassurance from the fact that understand exactly the issue they have face over many year as health secretary it be my responsibility and indeed my privilege to try to help they now in relation to the compensation scheme for those who have not yet receive payment know that the right hon lady will have carefully pore through the response of my right hon friend the minister for the cabinet office and paymaster general we want to give the independent compensation authority underline independent because be sympathetic to the sensitivity of family and victim around the role that the department of health and other play in their pain and sir robert the chance to set up the scheme assist by the expert panel promise the right hon lady that have be discuss psychological support with the chief executive of nhs england for some time we want to recruit the right people to conduct that incredibly sensitive work it will take we little more time but assure she that nhs england be act quickly to bring in those service we hope by the end of the summer call the father of the house thank the secretary of state for her answer to the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson hope that the letter that her department receive from we will get full reply and thank she for her interim word hope that the secretary of state will be able to come to the opening of the new integrate care centre by the town hall in worthing local authority enterprise carry on by the present administration in worthing there have be great concern about dentistry in my constituency the pressure be come off but not fast enough would she please encourage

speaker this be my final contribution to the house have serve in the secretary of state shoe know how hard it be to deliver on manifesto commitment deliver on the commitment to more nurse and the commitment on gp appointment and be on track with the new hospital be great achievement could urge she to say little more about how all that be support by the incredible improvement in technology in the nhs in the last decade without they there be no way for the nhs to succeed in the next decade harness extraordinary opportunity such as ai but not only that will stand the nhs in great stead if we can get the datum use properly and with that that over my goodness thank my right hon friend have an inkling of the responsibility and pressure that he bear during the pandemic there will be many thought about how the government and society handle the pandemic but he devote his absolute all to keep people safe and to move our society out of the lockdown thank he sincerely for all his work true to his character my right hon friend want to talk about the future outside the pandemic he have particular focus when he be health secretary and in previous cabinet position on the role that technology can play in our life our nhs app now have three quarter of adult in england sign up to it that be testament to he and to those in the nhs who help to deliver it there be more subscriber to the nhs app than to netflix the most common user of the nhs app be those over the age of we can see just how powerful the app can be and the role that it will play in prevention but we need to invest in the technology view the long term workforce plan as critical to build the next year of the nhs as be the tech plan that the chancellor announce in the spring budget which provide billion for technology to drive forward progress in the nhs plan that the opposition have not support may take this opportunity to thank all nhs staff for their dedication professionalism and care which be really quite extraordinary in the light of the circumstance that they face spend year work in and around the nhs and know that it be on its knee in and before the labour government make such difference but nothing compare to the state of it today be think particularly about nhs dentistry my constituent be have to wait seven year for an appointment with an nhs dentist know that my hon friend the member for ilford north wes streeting will meet dentist on the first monday after labour come to office the secretary of state have not adopt plan that would have work the one produce by the health and social care committee can she tell we why she do not adopt that plan in full and what she will say to my constituent who will vote at the poll for service that work as oppose to one that be break join the hon lady in thank her local nhs staff and indeed nhs staff throughout the country the nhs employ more than million people and every single one of they contribute in their own way from clinician to nurse to hospital porter to administrative staff all those people play really important part in keep we well and safe notwithstanding the picture that the hon lady have seek to paint hope she will have the graciousness to acknowledge that we be diagnose more cancer case and diagnose they more quickly at stage and hope she will acknowledge for example that some nine out of cancer patient be treat within day of decision to treat they and that the average waiting time in england not wales be just under week of course there be more to do but we have plan in place also urge the hon lady to look carefully at our dental recovery plan we have see more practice open up to provide more nhs appointment and as the recovery plan be roll out we will see up to million more appointment roughly three time as many as will be see under labour dental recovery plan compare and contrast let add my good wish for your retirement madam deputy speaker hope it will be long and happy one thank my right hon friend for her statement as wait list figure continue to fall which be fantastic it be vital that we continue to boost access to primary care so will she join in welcome the news that the excellent garth surgery in gisborough in my constituency be seek to expand by create six new consulting room and more space for the recruitment of gp registrar thank my right hon friend for present we with what be happen on the ground rather than the relentless doom and gloom that we hear from the opposition there be excellent example in our local area of people not just enjoy work in the nhs but thrive in it my right hon friend general practice will be one of those that have contribute to the million more gp appointment make available in the last year an election promise that we make in and have keep let explain the math to the opposition that mean more than million primary care appointment each work day that be something of which we should all be proud and for which we should thank our gps may say how sad be madam deputy speaker that whatever the result of the general election it will not bring you back to the place that you so wonderfully occupy waiting list dental service mental health service clinical trial workforce morale cancer care innovative treatment childhood obesity whatever the measure the tories have fail we on health be the secretary of state really ask the people of this country to vote for five more year of tory failure when they can by vote labour vote for the change that the health service and indeed the country so desperately need may gently remind the hon lady that her party leader be former barrister declare an interest so be in the old day we barrister use to rely on the evidence but the evidence on which the leader of the opposition relie be produce in wales he say that it be blueprint for what will happen in nhs england my goodness as have say quarter of the people on nhs waiting list be in labour run wales the high number of patient who be wait two year be in labour run wales and patient wait on average six week long in labour run wales than in england be genuinely surprised that have be in his post for as long as he have the hon member for ilford north wes streeting for whom have considerable respect have not be able to influence or direct his labour colleague in wales to follow his idea if he think that they be so good that be clearly not work may add my good wish to you madam deputy speaker as you become one of the member of this place who have choose to leave it voluntarily in the come week and may say advisedly that wish you all the good as you leave this chamber of parliament may return my right hon friend to the subject of her statement an nhs update recently on international nurses day visit poole hospital to see the amazing new barn theatre that have result from the huge investment go into the nhs in dorset when we talk about the money that we be put into the nhs that often appear to the public to be mere statistic however in dorset and in bournemouth in particular we see not only the new barn theatre in what be become the primary elective part of the local nhs but as result of the million overall investment the development of the beach building beach stand for birth emergency and critical care and child health these be real investment which notwithstanding the outbreak of hyperbole that confidently predict we will see more of in the come week and which sadly we have not be able to cure in the last year be tangible example of this government commitment to deliver on the frontline be delighted to hear that and also to say that on my travel last thursday have the great pleasure of visit dorset and see for myself not just wonderful community hospital in shaftesbury but the brand new unit that be be build in dorchester it be thank to the hard work of the local trust but also to government investment that that important hospital alongside those that my right hon friend have describe can ensure that people in dorset receive the care that they need in modern way that be the modern national health service as we conservatives see it do it not concern the secretary of state that we be spend great deal of money because of the private sector which be an undermine factor in the nhs the nhs pay million to the private health sector in and many hospital be spend of their budget on private finance initiative contract do she not think that we could save an awful lot of money by concentrate on expand the nhs workforce their loyalty dedication and efficiency be far well and far great than the atomisation of our service into myriad private sector provider it be cheap and more efficient to provide the service publicly thus provide well service for everyone let the record reflect this rare moment of agreement between the right hon gentleman and the pfi contract sign by the last labour government have be an unmitigated disaster for our hospital and for the integrate care board and other who be try to fund they the labour government draft the contract so incompetently that we can not leave they without massive cost to the taxpayer that be the real cost of labour run private finance initiative however part company with the right hon gentleman on the role of the independent sector we already rely on that sector to provide something to the tune of of elective procedure want our resident treat as quickly and as well as possible and to my mind the independent sector must play an important role in that we conservative want to make it even easy for patient to choose where they receive their treatment so that they receive they more quickly as well as the quality of service that they want do not know whether he will be here after the election campaign but we there be at least one area on which we have agree namely pfi rise order be extremely grateful for all the terribly kind comment which mean that be bit reluctant to say this but we need to crack on so ask for brief question and brief answer interruption it appear that the whip agree with they know that we have the business statement and then the finance bill to get through good example will be set by sir christopher chope thank you madam deputy speaker for give such as good example to this house as always my right hon friend be kind enough to meet and our right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright to discuss the plight of people who be victim of vaccine damage she sound very sympathetic at the meeting and promise to look into the vaccine damage payment scheme so it be rather disappointing this week to be tell in answer to write question formal consideration of whether any reform to the vdps be necessary will form part of module of the inquiry the inquiry will not be hear until january next year and it smack of kick the can down the road and ignore the victim who need help the sum have not be increase since order fear that my authority be drain away so will make another plea for brief question think the hon gentleman be go to set superb example however be sure the secretary of state will now respond briefly very much share my hon friend concern will take away what he have say but want to look into this issue because understand the point that he and our right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright have make the secretary of state come to the house at the end of parliament to paint her government record on the nhs in the most positive light possible have to say to she that the picture she paint will not be recognise by staff work in the nhs or patient anywhere in my constituency will give she an example it be impossible for my constituent to get an appointment at some gp practice in timely manner at the same time our local hospital which be under severe financial pressure be report record number of patient attend its urgent care centre because they can not get an appointment in primary care will the secretary of state acknowledge her government failure to tackle primary care which be place unbearable pressure on doctor work in our hospital to do the good for their patient again pay tribute to our general practitioner and all the staff who work with they in practice because we know that they have deliver some million more appointment than in that be an election promise make and keep on the hon lady wide question about primary care that be precisely why we have roll out pharmacy first to free up gp appointment it be precisely why we have focus on prevention because we know that if we can help people through the nhs app it will take the burden off gps it be also why we be look at fit note in an imaginative and thoughtful way because have listen to gps who say that if we can reduce these sort of responsibility on gps it will leave they with more time for patient thank my right hon friend for her support in ensure that my community diagnostic centre in rochester will have extra funding so that an mri scanner can be secure which will make big difference to my local community as she know have be work with the hospital and have conversation about my campaign for second hospital site in medway could my right hon friend have some conversation with her colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities we have homes england government own site on the hoo peninsula that be absolutely prim for second hospital site medway council be do its local plan and it be imperative that the area be use as health site rather than housing site thank my right hon friend who have be such firm campaigner on these issue her constituent should be very pleased with everything that she have do to press upon the importance of this matter the community diagnostic centre be open and will provide more test check and scan for her local resident will take up those conversation and be very much look forward to come to visit she in the next parliament to celebrate the opening of the centre dame rosie in the word of south pacific if we ai get dame where would we be in november boris johnson and the right hon member for bromsgrove sir sajid javid appoint to co chair programme board to create national strategy on acquire brain injury this issue matter in every single one of our constituency and be afraid we be still fail despite the month that have pass it have not be possible to put the strategy together for whole series of reason include churn of minister and the fact that the government be not able to put single penny into it not even enough money to check how many people suffer brain injury every year this be cross party issue how can we ensure that later this year regardless of who form the government we end up with national strategy for acquire brain injury so that we do not just save people life when they have be in road traffic accident but give they back the quality of life and independence that they so dearly deserve thank the hon gentleman and know that he have be work very closely with the minister for health and secondary care my right hon friend the member for pendle andrew stephenson on this issue he will remember the cross party working that we have when take the domestic abuse act through the house and our concern about the disproportionately high rate of abi among female prisoner will take away the hon gentleman thought he will appreciate that might not be able to enter into detailed discussion with he on this issue during the campaign but very much look forward to continue our discussion from the dispatch box in six week time thank you for your service madam deputy speaker long time ago be medical student and improve access to general practice be really important to be proud that the record funding that we have put into the national health service have enable we to have not just extra nurse but extra clinical staff in gp surgery in my constituency the average surgery be do extra appointment every working day compare with at the start of this parliament but an age society mean more and more pressure what be the minister do to take the pressure off with thing like pharmacy first thank my hon friend not just for his early commitment to the medical profession but for his work as health minister he do so much to help prepare the dental recovery plan and be so grateful to he for all his work on his question about prevention and the scale of the demand on the nhs he be absolutely right one piece of work that we be try to bring together be about look at the whole person rather than individual condition because we know that as we age we will develop more condition and live with more than one condition part of my work to reform our nhs and make it fast simple and fair be about ensure that we be live long healthy life and concertina the period of ill health towards the very end of life so that it be well not only for we as individual and for our

proud of my colleague none more so than my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay be proud of my party and its mission to encourage and reward people who take responsibility and have always be proud of our country the hon member for manchester central and her leader be at disadvantage as they go into this fight because they be not proud of labour record they be try to disown it the labour leader have be distance himself from his own mps and candidate the anti business anti israel anti opportunity anti responsibility britain bash brigade that sit on the benches opposite it say much about her party that its sole campaign narrative be that the labour party be not really the labour party at all but recognise that it be at odd with the value of this nation be not the same as be supportive of they the public have be angry at we because of what we have have to deal with and because we have put the country first the question be whether that red mist will blind they to what be on offer under the red flag the burden on business britain be tie back into the eu regulatory straitjacket the undermining of nato through an eu defence pact the undermining of our border through an eu migration pact high taxis less disposable income the wreck ball that would be take to our constitution and the cut to the nhs budget that labour have so viciously make in wales the fact be that nothing matter more to the labour party than the interest of the labour party and its paymaster these be ruthless socialist lead by weak and unformed leader in six week time we will know the

and take forward may remind the leader of the house of the offer she make to arrange at least ministerial meeting with the chief executive officer of the cold chain federation so that he can discuss the brexit chaos at our border after the week national audit office report on the billion bill for brexit border charge that offer of meeting between he and an appropriate minister could not be more

year of conservative failure on the economy and leave legacy of high taxis fall living standard and stagnant economic growth the truth be that whatever the conservative say or try to do whether in the chamber today or on the campaign trail over the next six week it be too late to repair the damage that they have do to the economy and to people standard of living do not think that any of we be expect to be complete the bill remain stage in the rushed end of this parliament many of we have assume that the prime minister would call the election later in the year and still have not hear why he ultimately decide to call it for july have one theory which be that he realise that prolong the general election would raise the prospect of there be another finance bill in which the government may have have to legislate to end the non dom tax status let we face it the prime minister really do not want to get rid of the non dom tax status maybe he think this be way to avoid the conservatives have to keep their promise to end it be afraid that he may still be disappoint as if labour win the general election we will end the non dom tax status and the new loophole plan by the conservatives once and for all now that we be to have general election perhaps the conservatives will finally tell we how they will pay for their billion unfunded spending commitment to abolish national insurance altogether give their track record will not be hold my breath the opposition have try to amend the bill during its passage to force the government to come clean about the impact that their six year freezing of the income tax personal allowance and the high rate threshold be have on taxpayer across the country we have try to force the chancellor to set out what impact his and his predecessor policy be have on pensioner and how more of they will pay tax and more of they will have high tax bill as result of decision make by the conservatives alongside the impact on individual taxpayer we have try to amend the bill to encourage the government to follow our plan to bring back certainty for business by cap the rate of corporation tax at for the whole of the next parliament finally we seek to give certainty to the oil and gas industry by be clear that our strengthened windfall tax or energy profit levy would end no later than the end of the next parliament we be disappoint though sadly not surprised that none of our amendment become part of the bill the opposition will not oppose the bill third reading but let close by say two thing first pay thank to the clerks and the house of commons staff for all their support throughout the bill passage and to outside organisation include the chartered institute of taxation in particular for all their help not just with this finance bill but with all six finance bills for which have be responsible as shadow minister may also put on record my appreciation for the way in which the financial secretary to the treasury and the exchequer secretary to the treasury have draw line between the tough and sometimes barb exchange we have in the chamber and their courtesy and respectfulness outside the chamber that be not always the case in politic but when it happen believe that it make the house of commons well place while not for second compromising on the sharpness of the political question that we be here rightly to contest ultimately we be all here to do what be good for our country and do not believe that five more year of the conservatives would serve that goal not only have they become define by chaos and division and put party before country at every turn it be also clear that they have do too much damage to the economy they have squeeze living standard too much and they have stretch public service to breaking point hope that this be the last in year line of conservative finance bills because the country need change we finally have the chance to ask the british people what government they want for the next five year hope that they will put their trust in our change labour party to change our country for the well may start by pay tribute to you madam deputy speaker the good type of umpire or referee be one who be formidable but fair and greatly respected and you tick all three box be most grateful to you for call to speak do so as have some concern about unintended consequence arise from clause which be on the abolition of multiple dwelling relief for stamp duty land tax my hon friend the minister set out some of the reason for abolish it wish to go little far and perhaps pry little more response out of he to allay those concern make these observation as former charter surveyor as the mp for constituency that might be adversely affect and have receive representation from the british property federation be aware that number of pension fund investor builder and professional adviser have write to my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer express their concern the build to rent sector rise from combination of the introduction of stamp duty land tax multiple dwelling relief in and the implementation of some of the montague review recommendation in subsequently it have be extremely successful some million have be invest in the build to rent sector result in additional home be complete with further in the planning and delivery pipeline the sector still represent relatively small proportion of the delivery of new home but it be grow rapidly the number of complete build to rent home increase by year on year in the fourth quarter last year investor and developer initially focus on london then the large city such as manchester birmingham and leeds now their interest be ripple right out across the uk build to rent act as an anchor in large development scheme it help get home of other tenure build and multiple dwelling relief enable much need home to be build outside london and the south east in area where there be low property value and development otherwise would not be financially viable my concern be that the abolition of multiple dwelling relief in the form propose could have variety of unintended consequence which will go through briefly first as know from my own inbox and postbag which anticipate be the case for all colleague we need to build more home to rent the bill potentially remove one of the way of do that secondly it will have an impact on specialist sector student accommodation and sheltered housing where in response to demand developer be increasingly look to provide unit to let thirdly the relief be most need in area where the property market be weak outside london and the south east and often in area where the need for more housing be most acute fourthly we have problem in the uk of too few house builder the small and medium sized house builder be an increasingly endanger specie clause could undermine an alternative mean of housing delivery finally be mindful of the enormous task of urban regeneration and town centre renewal that we face right across the uk in other word level up which have be the theme of much of this parliament this task be enormous and incredibly expensive it be neither practical nor possible for the state to do that heavy lifting on its own private finance must be leverage in from pension fund and investor multiple dwelling relief be means of do that some might say it be small thing but its abolition could send negative message that there be no place for the public and private sector to work together we could amend clause to retain the multiple dwelling relief for transaction of six or more dwelling on the basis that it would underpin the development proposal of large rent housing scheme and would result in significantly more rental home be build than if the relief be completely abolish the threshold of six mirror the exist rule that purchase of six or more dwelling can be treat as commercial property transaction for stamp duty land tax purpose and be at level at which multiple dwelling relief be hard to abuse would be grateful if my hon friend the financial secretary to the treasury who have be incredibly patient listen to my various concern about this bill during its course could comment little more and seek to allay my genuinely hold concern very much like the early comment madam deputy speaker about your be good example to woman in this place and someone whom people look up to agree with that and want to begin by thank you let now say something about the washing up of finance bills in general and about this particular bill in the context of wash up it seem to that have spend great deal of my time in parliament deal with finance bills and have also spend far too much time deal with finance bills during the washing up process do not know whether anyone remember the finance act but because an election be call the bill have to go through that process and it be massively gutted beforehand my problem be that have table amendment to all the clause that be now be remove and be somewhat unhappy about the fact that have do significant amount of work that would never see the light of day on that occasion give speech that think last more than minute in which speak about every amendment have table but can reassure that house that will not be do the same today have not table amendment to this bill and neither have my hon friend the member for inverness nairn badenoch and strathspey drew hendry in fact have come in at the last moment to take over from my hon friend because sadly he have return to inverness before the prime minister make the announcement of the election and there be no physical way for he to get back in time today appreciate the hard work that he have do during the bill early stage he be sorry that he can not be here and unfortunately be poor substitute but will do my good we will be vote against the bill third reading be sure that no one will be surprise by that give that we table reason amendment on second reading and that this be consistent with the approach that we have take throughout the bill progress let say little about the way in which finance bills specifically this finance bill and other recent finance bills go through the house there have be an ongoing issue with ministers include chancellor refuse to include amendment of the law resolution refuse to include budget resolution for amendment of the law be genuine constitutional change and it have take place without much of fanfare pretty much on the basis that it be do during that wash up in or in the case of finance bill that be introduce with very tight timescale after that the resolution be never bring back although it be important to finance bills and it be important for scrutiny purpose hope that should they become government at some time in the future the official opposition will commit themselves to bring it back be also concerned about the fact that finance bill committees continue not to take oral evidence the procedure committee will be sick of hear talk about this because bring it up at nearly all its meeting but the lack of oral evidence mean that scrutiny be not as good as it could be appreciate that the minister mention those who submit write evidence but do not think that that be an adequate substitute understand the argument of ministers that finance bills be take by committee of the whole house follow by public bill committee session but much of the stuff that be consider in the public bill committee be extremely technical and it would benefit member to be able to question external organisation with real experience the association of accounting technicians for example would be able to give we significant amount of information about how such measure would work when committee deal with bills with which have be involve have take oral evidence member have rely heavily on quote that evidence throughout the progress of those bills and think that this would greatly improve both the finance bill and its scrutiny let now turn to our specific concern about this bill the chancellor make number of comment on radio yesterday morning before the announcement of the election one of the excellent journalist on the programme push he to say whether or not he feel he be well off now than before the chancellor do not answer that question but the reality be that if we ask people up and down these island what their big concern be at the moment they overwhelmingly say it be the cost of living crisis they be massively concerned about the fact that food electricity and gas price have go through the roof and about the extra money that they be have to shell out the budget be an opportunity for the uk government to recognise that concern take it seriously and do what we do in scotland we have put tackle child poverty front and centre of decision make process we have the scottish child payment which have take child out of poverty we be do everything that we can to mitigate the uk government policy but the reality be that all we can do be mitigate give that the block grant be the low percentage of uk government spending that it have be since devolution with capital budget for the scottish parliament be slash we find that increasingly difficult because we be not in control of all the lever we be not in control of all our finance we can not increase the minimum wage to proper living wage rather than pretendy living wage we can not scrap the two child cap we mitigate as far as we possibly can but we do not have all the power that we require people in scotland be well off as result of the decision take by the scottish government they be get free university education and they can go to the dentist for free can not believe the low percentage of nhs dentist in the rest of the uk people in scotland can receive the scottish child payment and high number of child from deprive area go to university in scotland there be huge amount of good be do in scotland but it be be do by the snp government who have one hand tie behind their back by westminster the chancellor refusal to say whether he feel well off show the difference between the have and the not throughout these island if we ask people who come to reception in parliament people who have high salary how they feel about the cost of living crisis they might say that they feel it bit and that they will have slightly few holiday or slightly few car but they do not have to make decision every moment of every day about every penny that they spend they be not like our constituent lie in bed at night worry about how they will pay the rent and electricity bill and how they will manage to buy bread potato or pasta the inflation figure announce yesterday do not show that thing be well they show that inflation be less high than it be but do it really make difference to those buy pasta that it have go up by only rather than over the past few year give that there have be overall increase in the cost of food and that benefit and social security have not keep pace the uk government have the opportunity to provide help with the cost of live crisis in the budget and they do not take it they talk about the change that they be make to national insurance and tax but those change impact only people who be work and earn above the threshold and good chunk of they particularly those on the low earning also get universal credit there be major issue with universal credit particularly for single people but also for those with large family because of factor such as the two child cap the reality be that this uk government have an opportunity to make difference to people life and they refuse to take it they do not have the same priority as we we will always put scotland first we will always fight in this place against uk government decision that the people of scotland be unhappy with whether under tory or labour uk government we will do everything that we can to ensure that scotland voice be hear we will do everything that we can to disagree with legislation that the people of scotland disagree with and everything we can to work cross party when legislation be in the interest of the people of scotland have make it very clear that we disagree with this legislation and will oppose third reading thank those who contribute to the debate and of course those who have contribute to debate on the bill throughout its progress turn first to comment make by the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman respect her view about scrutiny of bills in this place however hope that she recognise that finance bills often contain many many clause some of which have be develop over many year be subject to multiple consultation and have huge amount of input appreciate that she acknowledge that lot of write evidence which be hugely valuable and very much appreciated be also provide the fact that she and her colleague be press for division on the bill this evening evidence that there be scrutiny hold to account and diversity of opinion on these matter disagree with many of the hon lady other comment on who be well off million worker be well off because of the national insurance cut and million self employ people be well off if she do not believe that suggest that she look at her payslip she will see that national insurance be go down that make meaningful difference she may be sniffy about it but be meaningful difference for an average worker for many of my constituent and constituent across the country for those not in work of course we also increase benefit by and pension by we conservatives always make sure that all people in society be look after the hon lady make comment about support with the cost of living the opposition consistently seem to have collective sense of amnesia and have completely forget the last five year and the global challenge that all economy face with the pandemic follow by the global cost of living crisis this government have have to intervene in way that nobody anticipate it mean that taxis have to be high but as soon as we get the opportunity as soon as we have the choice to bring they down that be exactly what we will do because we know how difficult this have be for people and want to put more money in their pocket as soon as we can we have plan and it be work always respect the opinion and view of my hon friend the member for waveney peter aldous and be never alarmed or disturb by his frequently hold and the government to account for policy decision can give he some reassurance though the multiple dwelling relief be be abolish for very good reason it be not work as intend of course considerable amount of money be involve when we spend taxpayer money or allow relief we need to make sure that it have the intend impact the relief be not work as intend and be subject to considerable abuse so we be abolish it however can give my hon friend some assurance particularly on certain issue that he mention for example large investor include those in the build to rent sector who purchase six or more property in single transaction can still continue to benefit from the non residential rate of stamp duty land tax which can be quite beneficial we be engage in discussion with stakeholder include some of the body that he have mention because we do not want there to be unintended consequence we appreciate their input on this bill as always thank my hon friend for his fantastic intervention as always he be an amazing mp for his constituent and always appreciate his contribution thank the hon member for ealing north james murray for his gracious comment he be correct that what be write in hansard and what the public see of our sometimes rather robust debate be not always reflection of our generally positive relationship on personal level however that do not mean we do not have robust disagreement on policy and be afraid that will have to raise quite few point of disagreement today every single time have appear at the dispatch box the hon gentleman have complain about the government not call general election and now that we have call general election he be still complain that really take the biscuit he continue with his familiar refrain he never miss an opportunity to talk britain down refer he to my early comment about our intervention during the pandemic and their immense billion cost to the uk economy do not believe the opposition oppose single one of our intervention at the time so it be bit rich to complain about the obvious impact on taxation if he have an alternative plan would have love to have hear it then and would love to hear it now but it be non existent the hon gentleman be hop to alarm disturb and depress the british public into vote labour which be not particularly bright strategy the british public deserve well and we need to hear confidence and optimism not pessimism about the uk economy will not repeat the comment have make on many occasion about labour ridiculous scaremongering on the national insurance cut and the impact they could have on pension he know that the cut will not have negative impact on pension for the obvious reason that have hop he would now understand national insurance do not wholly pay for pension welfare or the nhs so why on earth be labour go around the country try to scaremonger old people and people who rely on the nhs into believe otherwise do not know it be not an admirable way to try to win an election the hon gentleman and his colleague keep repeat the mantra of change labour party maybe in some way that be true labour have certainly go from embrace the hard left of british politic to embrace the hard right that unbelievable journey speak volume about labour value it have none or as the old saying go these be our value if you do like they do worry we have other on policy too there be constant string of flip flop turn and uncertainty which be sure we will see during the general election we will be hold labour to account for example labour have abolish its billion green spending commitment but it seem to have retain the policy be labour abolish tuition fee maybe not will it abolish the house of lords maybe not will it return to free movement and the single market maybe not will it abolish universal credit maybe not will it increase income tax on top earner maybe not rent cap the ultra low emission zone banker bonus and zero hour contract we have have constant flip flop from the opposition not even they know what their actual policy be it completely lack credibility as say they can not expect the british public to be take for such ride the british public know where they stand with the conservatives because we have plan they can see it in the recent autumn statement the spring budget and this bill no matter what stage of life they be at they can be confident that the conservatives be there to support they with our childcare measure and the child benefit change in this bill it be clear that when they bring child into this world we be there for they through our national insurance cut and our measure to support business it be clear that we be there for those in work or run business if they have finish work and have retire we have show through the triple lock and other measure that we be always there for they we can have strong public service and strong welfare system that help the most vulnerable in society only if we also have strong economy to generate the taxis to pay for they strong recovery be vital for both the public and the private sector that mean that we on this side of the house be unapologetically pro business despite the challenge of the past few year we be now on clear path to recovery the economy be grow again inflation be fall real wage be increase and people who look at their pay packet will see that their national insurance taxis have be cut too that be more money in people pocket because of the action and decision of this government we have plan whereas the opposition do not we can not put that at risk so stick with the conservatives for bright future commend

to move that this house agree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss lords amendment this be an historic day it have be great privilege to be the minister for the bill and thank our official for move with lightning speed to get it to this point only five month from when the process commence also thank member in all part of both houses for their co operation and their collegiate approach to the bill include the opposition front benchers who have provide great support which we greatly appreciate thank the justice secretary my department secretary of state and the prime minister the bill would not have be possible without their support this be an historic day because as result of the bill conviction will be overturn on royal assent with his majesty agreement that mean they will be overturn tomorrow along with the contaminated blood scandal the horizon scandal remain terrible stain on our nation recent past it be one of the great miscarriage of justice in our nation history and over the course of the debate on the bill we have hear the testimony of victim and the lie and obfuscation of those who be responsible express by member across the house that have rightly make member of both houses and the public deeply frustrated and angry at the injustice that sub postmaster and their family have face it be right that the government have introduce legislation to exonerate those who have suffer for so long and the time provide for the bill today allow we to ensure that it be conclude we must not lose sight of the task at hand during this wash up and we must ensure that the hundred of innocent people who be wrongfully convict get the justice that they deserve and the compensation and exoneration that they desperately need the opposition have support the bill and we support the independent inquiry and wish to see it continue its work even this week with the testimony of paula vennells shock new information have be reveal and we will continue to push for justice for the victim at previous stage the minister provide assurance that he would ensure that case from the capture it system be look at because this bill do not cover the wide extent of the scandal and that the company responsible for horizon fujitsu and its executive will honour the commitment that they make to provide compensation rather than leave it to taxpayer to do so hope he can update we on any progress he have make since give that undertaking in the house this parliament will soon dissolve but ministers of the crown carry on for few more week hope the minister will make every effort to ensure as much progress as possible be make so that the family receive the redress they desperately need in the other house the labour front bench spokesperson highlight lord arbuthnot desire to see those convict by the court of appeal include in the bill before we at the time of speak the government oppose that we be sympathetic but we nevertheless remain opposed to parliament become in effect the appeal court for the court of appeal we would however support appropriate proposal to give the people not cover by the bill the opportunity to seek redress in the court hope the minister be able to look at what might be do to work with lord arbuthnot to find satisfactory solution for those case in conclusion be grateful to colleague from across both houses for the work they have do particularly the members of parliament who work so tirelessly to ensure that the plight of sub postmaster and their family be raise their work highlight that in this and other scandal such as the contaminated blood scandal it be the constituency connection and our relationship with the people we represent that be often the most powerful insight into see injustice early on and see broad pattern that expose major failure in our system be that in the contaminated blood scandal or the horizon scandal the message be very clear whoever and whichever party be in power ministers civil servant and those in position of power must listen very closely and not dismiss the concern of member of parliament who raise those case which can expose big pattern of injustice or the citizen we represent order before call marion fellows note that early today kevan jones announce that he will not be stand at the next election on behalf of all the victim thank you kevan for the doughty fight that you have put up on behalf of they all you have be absolutely amazing in what you have do you be sit next to jackie doyle price know it be only matter of time before she cross the floor more amazing thing have happen recently so it do surprise have decide that would not speak but feel compel to do so be very pleased that the bill have pass be very pleased that all the victim who have be exonerate by the bill will be exonerate tomorrow except those in scotland which be still unhappy about think it be huge pity and shame that that do not happen and that the three sub postmaster who come down here especially the last time the bill be before the house do not even get chance to hear what be be say because of the way of this house where nothing be ever fix we can bring people mile but they have to go back the same day and they can not stay want to pay tribute to someone can safely say be my friend the right hon member for north durham mr jones for all the counsel and help he have give already give little tribute early today but could not possibly not say thank you to lord arbuthnot and to the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson who so stoutly defend scotland the last time the bill be before the house this place be sovereign but not when it come to scotland so independence have well come soon call our right hon friend kevan jones thank you for your kind word mr deputy speaker think this will be the last time that speak in this chamber and can not think of more fitting debate in which to do so because it be the culmination of many year of fighting play small part in get justice for the sub postmaster much of it be down to alan bates and the family who go through this complete nightmare hopefully they will get justice and truth when the inquiry report next year this bill be always go to be important because of the individual involve unless you actually sit with many of these victim they would not have come forward to clear the stain on their reputation or to gain access to compensation it have be long fight and my partner in crime be lord arbuthnot someone ask how we have get together on this if people look back they will see that we both serve on the defence committee he be the chair at the time he have be very effective advocate and pay huge tribute to he there have be many member from all part of the house some be no long here who make contribution over the year and think that their support need to be recognise as well turn to the ministers involve would like to mention the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully who show such tenacity in his determination to get justice he be follow very ably by the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake have call he poacher turn gamekeeper but he be very effective one he have drive this case forward not in belligerent way but with patience and determination to ensure that people who have be wrong get justice that be something that we should all think about people can turn round and say no you be wrong the system can not be question and there be time when you can feel like you be plough lonely furrow but if you know in your gut that something be wrong it be important to just keep go this be one of those case but it have certainly be champion by the minister who have be an excellent advocate on behalf of all these people it have not be easy accept that some of the decision that he have to make be not easy and be not always welcome by everyone but he try his good and we have this bill today because of he have one final thing to say and this be unfinished business the minister know what be go to say now and it be about capture the pre horizon scheme which have be investigate hopefully we will get justice for those individual as well and again the minister be determined to get to the bottom of that by appoint an independent investigator to look at the case that have be refer to he shall be look from afar with interest but know that whoever pick up his brief or take on this case will not be able to put it down unless they get that justice in politic people often ask whether you can actually achieve anything there be lot of cynicism these day say to anybody who be aspire to be member of this place that they can change thing they can make difference but they have to be persistent most of the time people across the other side of this house may be political opponent but they be not our enemy we do the good in this place when we work together and in this case cross party working have achieve final justice for these people with the leave of the house have few final comment the shadow minister ask about the capture software that be use prior to the horizon software the right hon member for north durham mr jones have push strongly on these matter and we be have an independent investigation into they which we anticipate will report later this year be sure that he will take keen interest in that as will those on the opposition front bench team it be important that we get redress as soon as possible the bill open the door to rapid redress for hundred of victim of this scandal we believe that we can get redress pay from july onwards when the new scheme will be put in place on the court of appeal we be very interested to ensure that those people also get fair hearing and rapid rehearing of their case

manifesto commitment to repeal section of the crime and courts act which if commence could have chilling effect on the freedom of the press be tremendously grateful to the very talented bill team in

associate myself with those comment mr deputy speaker and echo the minister comment about the post office horizon system offence bill be pleased to be here tonight to see the final passage of the media bill it have be year since the last broadcasting law be introduce and in that time the medium landscape have change dramatically this bill ensure that our broadcasting sector can continue to thrive with regulation fit for the modern era the measure in the bill have be through several layer of scrutiny from the white paper to the pre legislative inquiry conduct by the culture media and sport committee thank the committee for its work and will take this opportunity to say some other thank yous thank the range of stakeholder include those throughout our broadcasting sector who engage so extensively with the content of the bill thank the noble lords include of course our labour lords team the civil servant and official and the ministerial team also thank my office particularly anna clingan while labour would have add some further measure to future proof and strengthen the bill be pleased to welcome its passage this evening far to that be happy to support the amendment from the other place which believe will strengthen the position and purpose of our public service broadcaster first it be right that the fundamental reithian principle of public service broadcasting be reinstate and it be important that educational programming for child and young people have an explicit basis in the bill labour have speak in detail at every stage of the bill about the importance of child access to public service content include educational content as we enter general election our medium be they our public service broadcaster our commercial radio and television station or our local media outlet include my local paper the barnsley chronicle will play an incredibly important role in hold accountable all of we who stand for public office our medium and broadcasting sector will and always do play fundamental role in our society and democracy be pleased that this legislation which will secure their future will enter into statute as we enter the election period would like to wish colleague across the house especially those who be retire my very good include of course my hon friend the member for halifax holly lynch and the deputy speakers who sit in your chair mr speaker my right hon friend the member for doncaster central dame rosie winterton and the right hon member for epping forest dame eleanor laing hear hear will hold on to the thank yous because will probably be here again tomorrow and can say they then we have support the media bill throughout its passage and will continue to do so but must flag few concern that we still have about it although we will not vote against the lords amendment there be some positive in the bill include the change to radio service particularly on demand service such as those access through alexa the government could have go far on in car broadcasting for example local radio be so incredibly important in aberdeen we have northsound and original which be absolutely fabulous get on very well with they most of the time those local radio station be incredibly important when it come to resilience as the snp cabinet office spokesperson know how much people rely on they particularly when it come to local event such as flooding to learn what be happen in their area be really pleased that minister have recognise the importance of local radio throughout the bill passage on the public service remit be pleased to echo the comment make by the shadow minister the hon member for barnsley east stephanie peacock about education we be happy to support the change that involve the inclusion of educational content and program quota although more could have be do on regional quota particularly those that just specify outside the for example we could go far to ensure that regional content be spread across the united kingdom appreciate that significant number of public sector broadcaster do that but we could have legislate to keep to quota in future prominence in on demand service be incredibly important because those service be such common way for people to watch television nowadays still have concern about the fact that gaming console be not include the provision on give prominence to public service broadcaster do not apply to those watch content on playstation for example the provision apply only to device that be mainly for watch television the government may have to change that in the future have concern about list event in relation to scottish football give that we have the euros come up and scotland be finally do decently and get to the final of an event it have be an awfully long time since we have have this optimism around football in scotland more could have be do on list event particularly those relate to scottish football give the massive support in scotland for football and our national team that would have be positive step forward would appreciate commitment to change in future to ensure that we have free to air football so that we in scotland be not the only one exclude from see our national team on free to air tv the future of terrestrial broadcasting be mention significant number of time throughout the bill passage appreciate the government ongoing commitment to the ability to access terrestrial service have concern about this issue from the point of view of resilience and ensure that people be not exclude from watch television if they do not have fast internet my main concern be that we will accidentally end up with terrestrial broadcasting service be dismantle or not invest in because there be no commitment to keep they the next government will have to make commitment to those service to ensure we have access to they post my last and probably big concern be about the change that clause make to section of the crime and courts act many promise be make to people after leveson there be many victim of press intrusion whose life be devastate by journalist who be not act ethically press regulation be not nearly as good as it could be appreciate the government position that section be inappropriate and that they disagree with how it might be implement if it ever be to be implement understand that but nothing have be put in place to ensure proper regulation and that when people contact the independent press standards organisation the press regulator they get proper redress there be balance to be find between the government position they disagree with state back regulation of the press and our we disagree with self impose regulation of the press especially when it seem to be able to do what it want and ipso uphold so few complaint my big concern about the removal of section of the act be that promise be make to victim during and after the leveson inquiry they be promise that the system would improve but it have not see significant improvement and the government removal of section with nothing proper and sensible to replace it mean that we continue to face the risk of press intrusion people could find themselves in the same position again with no opportunity for redress however as make clear at the beginning of my speech will not oppose the bill the snp have be supportive of it throughout its passage my last point be personal lead on the media bill because my colleague and hon friend the member for ochil and south perthshire john nicolson the culture spokesperson be unavailable at the time have to learn huge amount in very short time to lead on this bill for the snp and be indebted to all the organisation that give briefing sit down and speak to and answer all the stupid question that bring to they be genuinely indebted to they for all the work they do to ensure could speak in this chamber and in committee and not sound too stupid of course any mistake that have make be mine not theirs mr deputy speaker thank you very much for allow the opportunity to speak on this bill we will support it even though we have number of reservation thank the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman she be an extraordinarily diligent member of parliament and admire she for that simply want to thank she and the hon member for barnsley east east apology thank both member for all the work that have go into this legislation since we have discuss all these matter at length many time simply commend the bill to the house be very glad that we have finally get to this stage lord amendment

seek through the resurfacing of the road and no large vehicle sign be impose from the junction of withypool farm to ditton mill ford and the petitioner remain etc national grid proposals north east lincolnshire motion make and question propose that this house do now webb be delighted to have this opportunity to raise the issue of national grid proposal for the grimsby to walpole route which if realise will see stretch of pylon construct across the countryside in lincolnshire and neighbouring region there can be no doubt but that this would have major impact on the environment and economy along the length of the route my focus today be on the section pass through north east lincolnshire though note the presence of member from other affected constituency my hon friend the member for boston and skegness matt warman lead an excellent westminster hall debate on this matter on may and fully support the point that he and other raise but such be the concern and to some extent anger of local resident that want to wait for an opportunity to focus on the effect on north east lincolnshire be pleased thank to mr speaker to have the opportunity to put on record my concern about national grid proposal my hon friend be generous in allow to intervene to emphasise the case for south holland and the deepings which face exactly the menace he describe what be propose would compromise food security by use valuable agricultural land and blight the landscape as well as endanger in my judgment the wildlife in the site of special scientific interest that cover the saltmarsh on the coast this must be stop in the public interest and for the common good as my right hon friend say it must be stop and that be what and my constituent want my concern reflect those of my constituent significant number of whom have be in touch with in recent month to voice their understandable anger and concern at the national grid plan the main village impact be brigsley ashby cum fenby barnoldby le beck and waltham these be attractive traditional village that face be blight by monstrous metal structure and cabling while it may not be the legal case the reality be that project on this scale require popular consent if they be to be deliver well there be no point in bulldoze through public opinion this will lead to further resentment and distrust there be alternative and they must be consider decision such as these be an opportunity for government to show that the view of local community matter and that there be way of deliver the much need improvement to the grid that take account of those view be far down the east coast but recognise the problem my hon friend be describe in term of the impact on north east lincolnshire in suffolk coastal see that my hon friend the member for south suffolk james cartlidge be also here we have be concern for some time about the lack of vision in use new technology to avoid the devastation not just of pylon but think of friston and saxmundham in my constituency of converter and other substation those would have truly damaging impact on greenfield site and we should be do everything we can to get they on to brownfield site close to where the electricity be be use my hon friend the member for cleethorpes martin vickers have indicate that must be stop agree and also suggest we should at least have moratorium until the strategy be ready thank my right hon friend for the intervention and she be absolutely right moratorium be the way forward have attend one national grid consultation meeting and meet representative privately it be not ideal that its plan remain vague as to the exact route more concrete proposal would be beneficial to all involve the national grid have also give the impression to some local resident that this be fait accompli and be sure the minister will reassure they that be not the case also want to reassure they that be not the case the consultation that national grid be hold in the constituency and up and down the country must be meaningful and they must be certain that member from across the house will ensure they be meaningful congratulate my hon friend on secure this timely debate because what he describe affect norfolk suffolk and harwich and north essex in particular and other essex constituency where the government be not consider new technology at the moment instead of pylon we could have high voltage direct current underground system of the kind that be now the default option in germany for example get that on to the agenda would speed up that infrastructure because it would not be nearly so controversial and mire in judicial review and court process like other colleague who have intervene my hon friend highlight the point that new technology be available which must be consider before final decision be take infrastructure that transmit electricity across the country be nationally significant and we accept that upgrade in one form or another be need expand the network will indeed lower consumer bill as my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes note in the debate on may transmission and distribution cost be now roughly of every electricity bill it will also secure our energy supply as we decarbonise our energy production in pursuit of net zero of course the most ideal route from resident perspective be also accord to national grid the most expensive building pylon be cheap than bury cable or take they offshore once we consider that this infrastructure be need up and down the country we realise that the cost become staggering the government argue that power line bury underground be up to time more expensive although that be dispute and the cost often fall on to the bill payer however cost should not always be the primary factor in decision making government and their agency have wide consideration such as ensure that the quality of life for their citizen be as pleasant as possible they need to carry people with they by seriously consider every alternative and share their deliberation with the community involve similarly there be indirect cost of building pylon that have nothing to do with their construction but have be impose as tool to buy local support an example of that be the announcement of community benefit scheme to be provide for the area that will be fund although compensation might be well phrase for every overhead line and underground cable in an area and the cost of that must be take into account overall as must the discount of up to for household close to the new infrastructure be never oppose to local community be give much need funding to improve the area for the benefit of local resident of course it be only right that community be compensate for inconvenience particularly when it relate to such nationally significant work but those cost will soon add up and they must be include in calculation unfortunately constraint impose by government seem to have place an emphasis in favour of pylon as oppose to alternative such as underground and offshore indeed as my hon friend the member for bolsover mark fletcher stand in for the minister in the debate on may say overhead line should be the strong start report may vol the phrase strong presumption be loaded statement and do not indicate that full consideration will be give to alternative though he do clarify that flexibility be possible where there be high potential for widespread adverse landscape visual impact official report may vol some clarity on what high potential and widespread mean here would be welcome give that many community will have valid case to say that both term apply to development in their area thank my hon friend for give way as he be discuss the debate secure in westminster hall welcome the contribution of many member to that do he agree that the minister rightly express that there be huge amount of real feeling on our constituent behalf it be right that the government should listen to that and that this process need to consider those feeling perhaps we should ask whether it should be pause while those feeling be take fully into account agree with my hon friend whether we call it pause or moratorium we need to stop and reflect on where we have arrive hope the minister will confirm in his reply that although plan guidance contain an assumption in favour of pylon full consideration of the alternative will be put before ministers the proposal be short sighted and incoherent give the obvious necessity to rewire the grid to make it fit for the future and ensure we have the infrastructure in place to reach net zero by the country will require two or three time the amount of electricity as today but in respect of these plan there be clear failing of strategy in relation to how we ensure the necessary infrastructure my constituency be largely rural one as lincolnshire be more broadly and there be significant regional concern regard the impact of erect pylon on prime agricultural land and what that will mean for our food security in fact when it come to this land even underground wiring be not ideal give the disruption that might cause we be fortunate to benefit from an ever increase amount of electricity generate from offshore wind farm and my constituency be fortunate to be on the humber estuary which be lead force in the renewable energy sector that present an opportunity for an offshore grid transmit much of our electricity away under the sea at some point that electricity will have to come on land but it would significantly reduce the need for pylon and overhead cable we can learn here from example in belgium and denmark conclude by deliver few message to relevant stakeholder to national grid reiterate my previous remark where stress that it must consider the impact on resident in nearby village before make any decision and look to mitigate the impact on the visual environment to the great extent like many of my colleague be in favour of extensive underground and undersea section rather than utilise open countryside desperately hope that will be take on board in that regard be encourage by the prime minister reply on march when refer to he say he will recognise the balance we need to strike by make sure that we give our country the energy security it need but do it in way that be respectful of the impact on local community will make sure that minister take into account the concern he raise and that all the view of local constituent be take into account official report march vol do not want to make this speech too political however give that the ultimate decision on this matter be unlikely to be take until next year and consequently after the election my message to whoever sit on the treasury bench and be responsible for decide this matter be that and my conservative colleague will not let it rest the proposal as they stand will not get my support finally say to the minister that the government have set out ambitious but sensible environmental target if we be to achieve those target to reduce emission we will need to produce more electricity and clearly that mean that the additional infrastructure be require but we must protect our visual environment appreciate that ministers can not pre empt national grid final recommendation and must not prejudge issue that they will later have to determine but hope that the minister will ensure that the view of my constituent as well as those of other across the house be front and centre in the process and that the wide impact on the environment and economy of north east lincolnshire which be privileged to represent will be take seriously assure my constituent that their voice will be hear and that and know my colleague will fight any proposal that have detrimental impact on their community it be real pleasure to respond to the final adjournment debate of this parliament early today respond to the final westminster hall debate yes have literally be do the washing up in the spirit of the tribute that we have be pay to our soon to be depart colleague want briefly to pay tribute to my dear friend my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy while he claim that his proud moment be the looped sky news footage of he carry the bag of my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis disagree would say that he be one of our fine performer at the dispatch box and be one of our strong performer in the medium and in debate make that clear to each and every one of the chief whips and prime ministers at various reshuffle our party underuse he which be great loss he will be sadly lose in the future turn to this incredibly important debate thank my hon friend the member for cleethorpes martin vickers for raise this important issue which know be of importance not just to his constituency but to his region and across many area of great britain assure he as minister that have be lobby heavily by so many colleague on it an expand electricity network be critical to lower consumer bill secure our energy supply deliver green growth and skilled job and decarbonise our electricity system nobody deny that but that must be deliver in strategic and sensitive way which consider and mitigate impact on community and our treasured landscape thank all hon member present for their contribution the offshore wind grid will come in through grimsby west substation and skirt around the great grimsby constituency but resident be concerned that it will go through beautiful countryside pass by an area of outstanding natural beauty do the minister understand people concern that if this development be in another area of the country that area would not be get ride roughshod over as much as we feel that we be in north eastern lincolnshire as whole my hon friend have champion the voice of her community will come specifically to the importance of resident concern we all recognise that this be an important subject for community my secretary of state and be clear that community voice must be hear in our transformation of the electricity system the prime minister have make it clear that we be make the transition to net zero in way that support community and family that be true of new electricity infrastructure and the organisation that plan and deliver it be work to ensure that member will be under no illusion that to bring new home grow electricity on to the system we must expand the electricity network considerably rewire from where new generation be be build in our wind rich sea and new coastal nuclear site to connect it to area of demand we also anticipate that by we will need to meet double the current demand and we need an efficient high tech electricity network to transport that power from where it be generate to where it be need to drive our country forward the government be acutely mindful of the potential visual impact of electricity transmission infrastructure particularly overhead line on community that have be raise by member whether through parliamentary question tonight adjournment debate or the recent westminster hall debate as it stand although the use of undergrounding be the starting presumption in nationally designate area national park or area of outstanding natural beauty to protect those landscape overhead line be the strong starting presumption in theory that remain flexible undergrounding may be use in other area in certain circumstance namely where there be high potential for widespread adverse landscape or visual impact such decision will be weigh up through the planning process the secretary of state and be mindful of the constructive challenge make by colleague whether individually or in their sub group offset offshore electricity grid task force be one of those group on my first day in the department think it be just another whatsapp group have not be invite to join but it be powerful group of conservative colleague make sure that their community voice be hear on the back of that this week meet my hon friend the member for south suffolk james cartlidge who have detail and extensive knowledge of future opportunity that could and should be consider we have deep dive discussion about overhead cable be the strong starting presumption which in simple term be base on the cost as per the electricity system operator figure be sure that the house would recognise that since significant advance have be make to new technology as have be mention germany have already make underground cable the default the eso own recent figure for the east anglia study suggest that when consider lifetime cost not just the up front cost but the potential for long term low constraint cost and challenge around delivery speed each variable raise important question we can not answer with certainty whether those question be valid because the datum simply do not exist if we be to let community voice be hear and champion by my hon friend those community would expect at the very least that we have those answer not just to protect their community but to ensure that we deliver on our commitment as we race towards our net zero target to lower consumer bill we have to take the public with we or we lose everything at that meeting we be mindful to explore how we could carry out an urgent review to consider those variable and challenge those long stand presumption you may have notice mr deputy speaker an announcement this week that may delay what we have hop would be an urgent review whoever be in government when we return they need to ensure that they get the fact this review be an opportunity to ensure that community voice have be listen to and that we champion the good value for money for bill payer will continue to support that the minister be very generous about at the beginning of the debate but what he miss out in his generosity be the fact that one of the big privilege have have in this parliament be live with he for period as his flatmate should make it clear that be the clean one the minister be great friend of mine but he be also very good minister and really decent chap and obviously my two colleague from north lincolnshire my hon friend the members for cleethorpes martin vickers and for great grimsby lia nici be fantastic champion for our area on this issue what at about the rest of course there be those in broad lincolnshire be talk about north lincolnshire the really important point be the one that the minister be make just now our constituent feel that this be something that have be do to they they understand that we must increase our grid capacity but they feel that it must be do in way that make they feel that they have have voice that it have not be do to they and that every single option have be consider my hon friend have sum up exactly the point of this it be tribute to each and every one of my colleague who have be constructive and have engage in pragmatic way whoever be in my position when we return after the election should take forward this opportunity to conduct review to ensure that community voice be hear and we deliver those cheap community option greatly appreciate what the minister be say he be show great wisdom and have grasp all the issue even though he have be in the role for relatively short time there be problem in that connection be still be offer for station that have not even be grant planning permission but the key point that want to make to the minister relate to what be happen in the middle of the consultation and planning process before he leave office and he will continue to be minister at least until the decision of the electorate on who will form the next government will he and the secretary of state please make every effort to ensure that members of parliament do not lose their voice in the consultation and that if necessary the planning inspectorate be instruct to add time in recognition of the pre election period that be under way my right hon friend be wonderful boss when have the pleasure of serve under her stewardship in the department for work and pensions she have make her plea crystal clear and hope that common sense will be apply in effect thing be pause during general election period and whatever the format and whoever be the decision maker that person should always be mindful of community engagement that bring back to the core point the review give we an opportunity to obtain up to date fact recognise modern technology and the lesson that can be learn from germany and recognise the lifetime cost so that we can be confident that we be do our good to deliver low consumer bill which be crucial not just to help with the cost of living but to ensure that we carry the public with we in respect of net zero be grateful to my hon friend for his endorsement of offset it be encouraging to find that we have have bit of influence will he clarify however whether this background work will be continue during the general election period so that it be ready for an incoming minister whether it be he return to office or another minister tempt as it be to bind future government can not do so although know that my policy team feel it be important to look at those principle what can and will do however be ensure that be part of the process after the general election as this be the last adjournment debate of this parliament congratulate martin vickers and justin tomlinson they say that there be like dame well there be two dame have work alongside two dame for the past four and half year rosie winterton and eleanor laing and they have be absolutely superb we have work as an incredible team along
