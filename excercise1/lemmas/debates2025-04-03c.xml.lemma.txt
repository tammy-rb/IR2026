bunker independent and pop recs but venue like those across the country operate on financially precarious basis will the minister update the house on how he will monitor the implementation of the voluntary levy on arena and stadium gig so that it can rapidly provide financial support to venue like those in my constituency the bunker look absolutely amazing it be not for profit organisation apart from anything else that give young people and other an opportunity to learn how to play perform and record that be precisely the kind of venue we want to be able to support which be why be determined to get this voluntary levy over the line as soon as possible so we can put million of pound into small venue the last time be in sunderland be for at the stadium of light perhaps helpful line from she be what about all the plan that end in disaster be determined that that be not go to be one of they for the first time since no uk artist have make it into the world top album or single

tourism economy call the shadow minister as have be say tourism be huge contributor to the uk economy and be delighted to take part in english tourism week as many member will have do the government

will the minister categorically tell the house whether there will be cut to the visitbritain budget and if so will he transparently tell the house how much that budget will be cut by think the hon gentleman be talk about the great campaign budget and it be certainly true that finance have be tough we be look at precisely what money we may be able to source into that fund for the next year be very serious about want to develop uk wide visitor economy strategy think it might be valuable if the hon gentleman and sit down at some point and he give some of the idea that be rock around in his brain and we will see whether any of those can be incorporate into our plan tourism outside cities what step she be take to help increase tourism outside city not only be we an island economy but would argue that our town and village be just as important for our visitor economy as our great city recently spend pleasant weekend in chipping campden and many international visitor be wander up and

museum and it would be amazing if we be able to get it back into full use the garden be amazing apparently there be different kind of wild water lily but it would be good if we could get the whole museum go and pay tribute to the volunteer who be try to make that happen national insurance creative industries what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of the plan increase in employer national insurance contribution on creative industry as the right hon gentleman know large proportion of the creative industry be constitute as small and medium sized enterprise and the vast majority of those be protect from the increase in national insurance contribution importantly as many of they have say to they fully understand the need for great expenditure on our public service and that have to be match by find the money from somewhere have always be particularly impress by your brooch mr speaker nevertheless those increase be damage for any enterprise but we could make it up to they by restore baroness kidron amendment to the data use and access bill will the minister do that no we have just take it out of the bill for the precise reason that we do not think it would make the blind bit of difference to the financial support provide to creative industry today that be why we be not support the amendment grassroots sport what step her department be take to support the

this be the last moment will have to wish you mr speaker and all member of this house and staff very happy easter hope may do so easter be joyous occasion full of family and possibly inappropriate amount of chocolate will be make the shadow leader of the house legendary hot cross bun not very much of the mix actually make it into the oven but that be part of the joy it be lucky however that we have several week to look forward to easter because this week have not be one of joy we will be debate tariff later and we have also have the impact of the national insurance rise which have push up cost raise inflation make it hard than ever to hire new employee and block route into work for young people my question however be this what on earth be happen in birmingham as the house will recall birmingham city council be now in the fifth week of strike with the union unite over bin collection apparently this matter concern just few dozen out of some city council employee as the house have hear tonne of rubbish have pile up so far grow by report tonne week let we not forget that birmingham bin collection be reportedly three and half time bad than the bad of other council even before this strike the public health implication be now so dire that the council have declare major incident the strike come on top of two other recent fiasco first the athlete village in perry barr be build by the city council to host competitor during the commonwealth game in but be never use and have be sell at report loss to taxpayer of about million secondly birmingham city council try to install shiny new oracle it system result in disaster whose cost be set to reach odd million by accord to report by academic at sheffield university as city birmingham be technically bankrupt it have be control by labour for well over decade but my point be not about the council it be about the government the minister for local government let the cat out of the bag in his statement on this topic on monday when he say birmingham waste service have be in urgent need of modernisation and transformation for many year practice in the waste service have be the source of one of the large equal pay crisis in modern history result in cost of over billion to the resident of birmingham this situation simply can not continue official report march vol the prime minister go far in his own remark yesterday say the situation in birmingham council be completely report april vol however neither the minister nor the prime minister have yet offer any criticism at all of unite whose action be the cause of all this rotting refuse in the street unite be labour big union donor before the general election give to total of mp although not to the leader of the house be very pleased to say do she think there could be any relationship between the government reluctance to call out unite on the disastrous situation in birmingham and the half million pound in donation their mp have just receive some member of the house may see this whole situation as eerily reminiscent of the especially labour winter of discontent in when strike binman cause refuse to pile up across major city include in birmingham my worry however be about not the past but the future labour consistently back public sector union strike when they be in opposition point the prime minister conveniently forget to mention yesterday but now they be in power they have throw money at the union hand over fist with little or no negotiate improvement let we not forget that northern rail negotiator have even say that their agreement with the union require they to use fax machine there be very serious point here mr speaker at this moment the government be abolish nhs england and take direct control of the nhs do anyone seriously think that government who be incapable of call out their union donor over bin collection will have any ability at all to withstand pressure from the same and other union donor on the nhs what will that do to cost control and productivity to public spending and inflation would be grateful if the leader of the house reflect on those issue in her remark may join the shadow leader of the house in wish everybody very happy easter hope that member can resist eat too much chocolate and hot cross bun especially those who be on diet at this time of year today be day to reflect mr speaker because we face unprecedented time which have the potential to change the global trade consensus of the past year consensus that have bring this country and most western country great deal of prosperity we be still process exactly what the new tariff will mean for british business and we will shortly hear from the secretary of state for business and trade about that in more detail just as president trump be act in what he believe be his national interest we will always act in our national interest we will do whatever be necessary to protect british job british business and british consumer be sure the shadow leader of the house will agree that in any eventuality secure the long seek economic deal with our close partner the us which the prime minister have be lead on for many month be in our national interest and be sure the whole house will support he in those endeavour as the shadow leader of the house say this week be the start of new financial year and the annual uprating of bills it be also very worrying time for family the cost of living crisis be not yet over and many people will be wonder as the month begin how long their pay cheque will last we have inherit very difficult situation and the global trade war will not help but we be determined to protect work people that be what we be all about we be about make work pay with our employment rights bill we have see year increase to the national living wage and for young people there have be an unprecedented uplift to the national minimum wage which be now up to an hour the state pension will increase this week by we will take the action necessary to bring down in the long term our bill include those for water and energy the shadow leader of the house raise the situation in birmingham be in birmingham just last weekend visit my husband family and find the condition to be totally unacceptable it be awful what people be live with and we want to see the situation end and end immediately be happy to tell the right hon member that have no problem in say that the trade union unite need to step up get back round the table and come to an agreement reasonable agreement be on the table so the trade union and the council should be able to deal with this very quickly gently say to the shadow leader of the house however that do not think the situation in birmingham cover anybody in glory to make some party political point about it do not serve he too well he and other conservative members might have short memory but this be failure of successive leadership of that council include the tory liberal democrat coalition of the early in particular that be critical phase in resolve the equality pay dispute which other council include in manchester and other city deal with during that time while birmingham bury their head in the sand about it if the shadow leader of the house want discussion about what have happen with local government finance let say that local government be absolutely starve of finance for year under his government month after month we see council go bust include tory council such as northamptonshire and thurrock we have put record investment into local government and will bring forward devolution bill later this year which will include further measure on audit local finance the shadow leader of the house mention the impact of industrial action on the work people of this country but what do his government preside over we see more day of industrial action in our nhs and on the railway under the conservative government than we have do under labour that be what the conservatives want to do every time cause conflict and have industrial action we have see an end to industrial action in our nhs because the strike end waiting list have go down every single month for five month and another million doctor appointment have become available on the shadow leader of the house watch rail company boast about free cash from the government for their rail contract and we have record number of day lose to industrial action we put an end to that we get this country back to work in the interest of work people so will take no lecture from he mr speaker wish you and all the house staff colleague in the chamber and those outside an early happy easter sky be household name in britain and have million of customer be proud to represent stockport and sky be major employer in our town unfortunately it be announce last week that almost job be at risk in sky uk operation with role in stockport and more in leeds and sheffield impact have be work with my hon friend the members for sheffield central abtisam mohamed and for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and my immediate constituency neighbour the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart to support the staff impact serious question have be raise with by sky employee about the mass redundancy the process be leak to medium outlet before all staff be make aware of the redundancy and the lack of clarity about the level of support on offer to member of staff these redundancy will have detrimental impact on the economy and community of stockport sheffield and leeds will the leader of the house allocate government time for debate on sky and how it treat its hard work loyal staff be really sorry to hear about the redundancy at sky which will affect my hon friend constituent as well as some of mine nearby he be do his job as constituency mp by raise this important matter on the floor of the house be sure that the company will have hear his concern about the announcement be communicate via the medium before employee be tell that be just not acceptable one of the reason why we be bring forward our employment rights bill be to ensure that worker have more right in these circumstance and that employer have an obligation to ensure that redundancy be handle sensitively and with regard to people long term interest call the liberal democrat spokesperson on april we will mark the anniversary of the hillsborough disaster and remember the people who tragically lose their life on that dark day as well as their family subsequent fight for justice last september the prime minister give commitment that the hillsborough law would be introduce in parliament before we reach this anniversary duty of candour for public servant and public body be long overdue and will help stop future cover up it be vital that the legislation deliver on the commitment make to hillsborough family in meaningful way can the leader of the house give an update on whether the legislation will be introduce before we rise for the easter recess if it will not when we can realistically expect it thank the hon member for raise this issue it be also raise last week by my hon friend the member for widnes and halewood derek twigg she be right as we approach the anniversary of the hillsborough tragedy we should remember the life lose all the family affect and the year and year of fighting for justice and accountability that the family have suffer since frankly with the state fight against they in most case that be something we should all endeavour to put right as she say the prime minister and the whole government myself include remain focused on fulfil our commitment to the hillsborough family to bring forward and enact hillsborough law which will of course include duty of candour at all time that be very important measure to take forward at this time the most important issue be to ensure that the legislation reflect the full range of concern and experience and meet the expectation of the family the very bad thing we could do be not meet those expectation give that all the trust issue relate to the state fail to live up to the family expectation we be work on the bill at pace but we will take whatever time be necessary to work collaboratively with the family and their representative because get the legislation right be overwhelmingly our priority as be sure the hon lady can understand last month whitburn band from former mining town in my constituency win the scottish brass band championship for the third time in four year the band will represent

do fantastic job of blow the trumpet on behalf of her constituent laughter it be easter wish the band all the good in the championship call the chair of the backbench business committee on the business that the leader of the house announce have to say it be disappointing that we do not have backbench business on april my reading of the business that day be that the bill be uncontroversial and we be likely to finish early but we will be deny the opportunity to have debate on st george day which be of course on april or debate on parkinson awareness month which be april we be contemplate organise three minute debate on may which be local election day colleague may wish to be campaign elsewhere but that would at least allow debate on some of the motion that we have in the queue it would help if the leader of the house could confirm when estimate day will be in may by my reckoning there be only around four possible date and our committee have to advertise the opportunity for people to apply for an estimate day debate and then choose the debate on tuesday may there will be westminster hall debate on the persecution of christians when we return on april there will be debate on residential estate management company remind colleague that we will sit monday hour on that day so the debate will start at am rather than at am on thursday april there will be debate on lesbian

the un to vote indeed will they register their strong objection to her reappointment thank the chair of the backbench business committee as ever for organise so many good well attend debate he ask about april be sure he will recognise that there be bank holiday that week and two week later so we have number of short week and lot of government business to get through give that tuesday april will be more like monday be afraid that thursday april will be more like wednesday which be why on the thursday time be not allocate to the backbench business committee however hear what he say about st george day and be happy to have conversation with he about that as ever will try to give he as much advance notice as can of estimate day thank the hon member for raise the issue regard the un rapporteur he will appreciate that such matter be for the un however will ensure that the foreign office have hear his point as be sure his constituent have in general the government and would not

shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement business worker and their family wake up this morning with great fear and more uncertainty about their future tariff make we all poorer by push up cost suppress demand and make the pound in our pocket buy less of the thing we need it be free trade to which we owe our past prosperity and free trade that have lift billion out of poverty since the second world war this be moment for calm word and cool head and we will support the government when they do sensible thing to reverse the impact on our already fragile economy be glad they have recommit to reach deal with our close ally and large single country trading partner however this be also moment for honesty and tell the truth the government sadly get no special favour from the white house last night the secretary of state refer to vindication this be no vindication at all we be in precisely the same band as the congo costa rica kosovo and christmas island in fact can count more than country and territory that have the same us tariff level as we now do not that special our automotive manufacturer face unchanged tariff of on around billion worth of car and auto part export steel and aluminium export remain at and on volume weight basis our export face an average tariff of close to above all last night be vindication of those who be pillory and abuse for want our country to have the freedom to decide our own trade policy if labour and the liberal democrats have their way we would still be in the eu as the prime minister acknowledge this morning thousand of british job have be save today as the result hope that he and his colleague have the decency to regret the time that they vote to stay in europe and to thank we for get brexit do last week the obr warn that these tariff could knock up to off gdp we be already in per capita recession and market be fall this morning it be business that create job and grow our economy yet at every turn the government have pile on headwind when they need our support they put tax on job more than double business rate for many introduce the family business death tax and be barrel ahead with flawed recycling charge no wonder business confidence remain at rock bottom to help british exporter survive the government must urgently tackle our sky high energy cost business in birmingham west midland face energy cost that be four time those of its competitor in birmingham alabama in the us that dwarf the impact of tariff and be no basis on which to compete the secretary of state be responsible for the employment rights bill which will hit business so hard that the obr have not even begin to assess how much it will hurt the economy now be the time today be the day for the secretary of state to walk back to his department and in the national interest instruct his official to shelve the employment rights bill he should put ideology aside put the union on hold and put the government on the side of british business the cost of failure be too high the burden on business be too great and time be too precious the secretary of state must act and act fast let conclude with some question for the secretary of state on behalf of all our constituent will he publish an urgent assessment of the impact of today tariff on the uk economy so that the market can see whether the chancellor emergency budget sum still add up or whether she will be back for more taxis when will he give the car maker the clarity they need on the zev zero emission vehicle mandate will he undertake to keep parliament inform and to publish the uk broad objective not its negotiating strategy but the broad objective in these trade negotiation with the uk precisely as the previous government do in march will he assure we that any deal will back british farmer and food producer and uphold our high environmental protection and animal welfare standard which we have enhance and uphold in the agreement that we have reach since leave the eu will the secretary of state now surge additional resource for exporter reallocate resource across government to fund new version of the uk trade show programme and enlarge the great campaign what consideration be the government give to the special situation of northern ireland will he guarantee that all claim under the duty reimbursement scheme for northern ireland will be pay promptly and the government will commit additional resource when require can he reassure we that in the event the uk do see major trade distortion in northern ireland the government would be prepare if necessary to trigger article of the windsor framework will he reassure the house that any concession to uk tech giant on the digital service tax will not simply shift the burden to the united kingdom small business the conservatives be on the side of business and britain we understand the gravity of the situation and we will support the government where they act in the national interest hope that they will take this moment seriously get back around the table with their us part and involve the house in their deliberation thank the shadow secretary of state for his response and his tone in respond recognise his commitment to free trade and the case he have make for it believe it be something we broadly share he ask for honesty that be always good in parliament but he be little bit flippant about the position we find ourselves in today he mention series of country christmas island kosovo that do not have the kind of complex trading relationship that we have with the united states the shadow secretary of state can see from my tone presentation and word that be disappointed that we be in this position but look at the eu face tariff of at japan with at india with and at canada and mexico with tariff already in place yes we be in more favourable position compare with those key friend and ally but we must go far especially in relation to the tariff on the automotive sector which be particular concern for the shadow secretary of state again bring up brexit which be perhaps not the conservative party fine hour in prepare the state for large trade shock but let we pass over that as the president of the board of trade be of the view that it be good that we can set our own trade policy but say to he and to all colleague be it not time that we try to unite the country for the future rather than keep on hark back to the past be that not how we will find our way through this half the country vote one way and half vote the other way but let we build together and look to the future it be the right way forward my next point be very important it be false to see this as choice between work with the us and work with the eu we can work in way that be consistent with both and we should all be commit to that the shadow secretary of state also ask about the implication for the united kingdom broadly he ask to reverse series of policy choice make in the last year will go through all of those in relation to the spring statement the chancellor have already rebuild the headroom substantially high due to the global turbulence than that bequeath she by the conservative party on the conservatives spending plan they leave no business rate relief whatever it be one year relief roll over that never have any longevity have not yet receive any credible proposal on how their spending plan would be pay for but be always available to receive those in writing the shadow secretary of state ask for reassurance which we be always happy to provide on domestic policy change on thing like the zev mandate for the automative sector we be more pragmatic than the conservative party be when in office as he know the department for transport lead on that policy but our response to the consultation on potential change will be publish soon as colleague would expect will not comment on the detail of any negotiation with the us in our manifesto we commit to the uk sanitary phytosanitary and food safety standard system of course the government will adhere to that the shadow secretary of state also know that we be imminently prepare to publish our trade strategy which cover lot of these issue particularly around support for exporter that we want to proceed with northern ireland be an incredibly important issue for all colleague the potential for differential response from the european union could lead to difficult situation in northern ireland as the secretary of state highlight the key policy be the duty reimbursement scheme because good enter northern ireland from the us that will not go into the wide single market be subject to the reimbursement programme we must make sure that that work well recognise the point that he have make on it and will continue to update the house and all colleague on our work in this area recognise how important and relevant it be to all our constituent so we will endeavour to keep all colleague update on progress worker at bmw at cowley be deeply concerned by the recent news bmw be right that trade war would have no benefit the secretary of state be right to engage calmly with his us counterpart but what discussion have he have with his eu counterpart give how integrate our automotive sector be with that of eu country my right hon friend be right that some of our iconic automotive manufacturing brand such as bmw jaguar land rover and aston martin have have particular success in the us market and be therefore expose to tariff there be close co operation in government between the team work on our eu reset and on our trade negotiation in this area so assure my right hon friend of the alignment continuity and consistency of our policy my right hon friend will know that along with the change to domestic policy such as the zev mandate there be significant money in the budget for incentivise the roll out of infrastructure for electric vehicle and billion have be put aside for the wide joint collaboration and research and development initiative with the automotive sector which remain clear and consistent government priority will keep my right hon friend update give her particular constituency interest call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement donald trump have launch destructive trade war that threaten the job and living standard of people across the uk and around the world let we be clear this be not about reciprocity or level playing field the us be conflate our high british standard with trade barrier and it be do so on purpose this be donald trump say to the uk that he will lower tariff only if we lower standard he be say sell out your nhs to us vulture firm or else sell out your farmer to us big business or else and give up protection against online scammer and for child safety to us tech baron or else if the government give in to trump threat it will only encourage he to use the same bullying tactic again and again it be simultaneously true that the way the white house have make its crude calculation actually make britain negotiate position bit well than the position of other country and we genuinely welcome that it be relief to we all with regret there be however no sign that the government lobbying have bear any fruit give that we have be put on the same regime as number of other country such as honduras peru and guatemala this must be wake up call we liberal democrats believe that we must end this trade war as quickly as possible which mean stand firm with our ally against trump attempt to divide and rule will the government take urgent step to bring our commonwealth and european partner together in an economic coalition of the willing against trump tariff we welcome the month of consultation with business will the government confirm that they will look at energy cost and business rate reform as part of that four week consultation especially in respect of the car industry will the consultation run in parallel with talk with our ally to draw up plan for the co ordinate use of retaliatory tariff when do the government expect to publish an assessment of the impact of the tariff on small business job and the cost of living will they look seriously at launch talk with the eu to create bespoke customs union let we be clear the uk would not be in bad place if the government have heed our call to negotiate custom union even the conservative party should be able to see that turkey have be in custom union with the eu since and it have likewise be hit with tariff of only finally will the government rule out once and for all the watering down of the digital service tax or our digital competition regulation to appease trump billionaire backer be grateful to the hon lady for her question and her submission be pleased to hear that she feel we need to end any potential trade war although be pretty certain hear she in the medium last week demand that we escalate the trade war do not think that be in any of our interest and it be not the route and direction we need to go in the hon lady mention that there be no sign of the uk be treat in any different way she will know that the us have view of vat that we do not share the us compare vat to its sale tax if we look at our rate of vat and the comparable treatment of the european union we see that there be differential that do not satisfy because believe we could seriously get to position in which we not only avoid the imposition of additional trade tariff and barrier but deepen our trade relationship and remove some of the barrier that already exist particularly in the trade in service that be the government objective we of course work closely with whole range of friend and ally but when they go into any negotiation they represent their own national or custom union interest and we do the same would not expect any country to go into negotiation try to represent the uk other country will have their own interest do the same for the united kingdom have to put our interest first there be different structure to the trading relationship between the us and the uk for instance the us do not have with we the large deficit in trade good that it have with the eu or china so it be different level of conversation and it allow we to put our own interest first that be all that the government seek to do in our policy towards the us the hon lady mention range of other issue that recognise colleague know that have strong view on the very large increase in industrial energy cost that occur after there be an increase of almost in real term and think they need to be address the industrial strategy and other government initiative set out our wide policy objective and tool in this area the consultation and call for input that announce today be much more about the formal step we need to take to understand from business the impact and give they the chance to put forward their view as say that will not be necessary if we can come to an agreement which believe all member want we to do believe that the relationship can be deepen if we get it right it will not come at cost to our other key trading relationship such as with the european union that be the government objective and welcome any support from throughout the house for fulfil it thank my right hon friend for his statement yesterday dramatic shift in us trade policy mark an historic abdication of the principle of open commerce and global trade that have underpin the economy of the western world since the end of the second world war tariff bring no winner there be only loser through high cost for consumer and high barrier for business and industry will the secretary of state set out how the government be work with international institution such as the world trade organisation to prevent further escalation and position the uk as lead champion for open market warmly welcome my hon friend question he be right that this be substantial change in us policy it be important that even if we do not agree with some of the decision make and the thinking that underpin they we recognise where they come from indeed they be part of the us presidential campaign so we have be able to prepare the ground for our conversation my hon friend ask about international co operation we be strongly involve with the wto and particularly support the re election of dr ngozi as its director general it be important to remember that despite the problem the multilateral system face it be still the basis on which the vast majority of trade around the world take place we will continue to play constructive role in relation to the wto and any multilateral organisation where that serve our interest what be miss from the secretary of state statement and from his reply to both opposition front bench spokespeople be the government estimate of the cost of the tariff particularly in the context of the chancellor fiscal headroom will the secretary of state update the house on that specifically as former treasury minister the right hon gentleman will know the kind of work that go on to make sure that such assessment be make the announcement come late last night it be only last night and this morning that we have have the chance to respond to it he will also appreciate that the impact on the uk be about not just the direct relationship between the us and the uk but what happen in the wide global trading system how other country choose to react to the us announcement will be the determine factor for the impact on the uk and we do not know that at this stage promise to keep the house update and to update the right hon gentleman personally if he wish at any stage on our work to assess the impact on the uk for all member of parliament this should be time for reassurance for calm head and for give clear information to british business on how we will navigate these difficult time that be the correct message to send out from parliament if those on the opposition front bench be still try to propagate the argument of suggest they be bit drunk on chlorinate chicken we need to get real celebrate tariff of rather than be like person celebrate the fact that when they be mug only their wallet be take not their watch as well the british public deserve well be grateful to the secretary of state for talk about our relationship with europe because who know what president trump will bring next week we do five time more business with the european union than with america it be in our interest to have close and stable trading relationship with europe but right now that be up for grab too what do the tariff mean for the secretary of state negotiation on the european reset and for the summit in may be grateful to my hon friend for her question let be clear again no one be celebrate the position that the country find itself in this morning we recognise the differential for the uk but all of we in the house member from all party be disappoint by the announcement from the united states and be seek to provide way through know that my hon friend feel very strongly about this matter but reiterate to she that we do not have to make choice between the us and the eu they be two key long term and important trading partner and security and defence partner as well the eu summit next month be key event our aspiration remain for an ambitious eu reset on trade to rectify flaw in the agreement make by the previous government our objective be clear and be all in the manifesto on which government members stand for election and win they remain key priority assure my hon friend that the alignment in government between the eu reset and the us negotiation be very strong the business secretary delay and dither for five month before meet his us counterpart and work people and business in the uk be pay the price for that dereliction of duty do he regret his refusal to meet his us counterpart early the hon lady be incorrect and must ask she to take bit more of serious tone in the question that she bring to the house this be really serious stuff have meet my counterpart on many occasion and we be in contact even before some of the formal procedure on the us side be confirm it be not technically possible to have be in touch with they soon their engagement have be consistent and serious she be incorrect and ask she to please approach these important proceeding with bit more seriousness the us tariff have serious implication for uk industry they be reminder of the importance of the industrial strategy and government support include for domestic making capability which sadly the conservative party neglect badly over year will my right hon friend confirm that he be fully commit to the plan for steel and confirm the importance of our sovereign steelmaking capacity be grateful to my hon friend for his question and for the work that he do alongside in this area over many year in opposition he know the commitment of the government and government members to the steel industry of all the issue of industrial neglect that we be bequeath those be some of the hard one to resolve there be no doubt about that he know that our ambition be strong whether we be talk about the future of british steel at scunthorpe and teesside or in term of sovereign capability our aspiration under the steel strategy for new investment and new technology the issue be difficult particularly this week know that all the worker at scunthorpe be concern but the government commitment to and work on the steel sector will go on can the secretary of state offer we any guarantee that the government will not enter into trade deal with america that will allow the importation and sale in this country of food produce to low environmental and animal welfare standard than those that we demand from united kingdom farmer the right hon member know that will not go into the detail of any negotiation but he know of our manifesto commitment to our sps regime which mention to the shadow secretary of state that commitment be important to the government and it affect all our trade negotiation not just this one welcome the secretary of state statement the port of felixstowe be the uk busy container shipping port though we import more than we export we be also the ninth large exporter and the usa market be important for our local and national trading market last night news will likely have significant impact on global trading market and it be not an exaggeration to say that it could change the global trading consensus of the last year just as president trump be act in what he believe be his national interest will the secretary of state reassure and my constituent in felixstowe and across suffolk coastal that he and the prime minister will act firmly in our national interest and do whatever be necessary to protect british job british trade and industry and british consumer my hon friend be right to talk about the historic scale and significance of the announcement last night particularly for her constituency which have economic infrastructure that be so vital to the country and how we will process the scale of the change assure she that the prime minister member of the cabinet and as the secretary of state be at all time do what she mention in the decision that we have have to make at pace so that we can put our national interest forward in way that have allow we to progress negotiation and to keep opportunity open for all the carefully choreographed bonhomie in the oval office last november the prime minister fail to secure us military backstop for his coalition despite no brief narrative about productive discussion at the weekend the prime minister have admit to business leader that there will be an economic impact from the decision that the us have take on times radio this morning the business secretary say that he would roll up his sleeve to try to remove the impact on business entirely that be bold claim give the circumstance and the impact that the chancellor budget be already have what timeframe do he envisage for an economic deal with the us what will he be do until may while wait for the view of uk shareholder the hon member will have hear this morning on the medium and here in parliament be clear about how we feel about these decision we be deeply disappointed that no country have be able to secure an exemption from the tariff but we remain committed to work hard to deliver potential way through this the hon member ask how we will respond respectfully the statement cover the fact that we will ask british business to work with we on the necessary formal step on the timeframe shadow lot of conservative business secretaries in the last few year there be fairly rapid turnover at one point and some of they give all kind of timeframe and commitment on trade deal but that be not in our interest because it put pressure on we in the negotiation the us side will have timescale that it want to engage on but believe that no country in the world be far advanced in its talk with the united states and hope and optimism come from that chi onwurah will be follow by steve darling the us be our close ally and the world large economy as well as be the uk great source of foreign direct investment so welcome my right hon friend calm and pragmatic approach and his determination not to abandon british worker right in the face of these tariff as the conservatives urge we to but rather to focus on the trade talk will the online safety act the digital markets competition and consumers act and the digital sale tax be part of the talk will he also say little more about his counter argument to the trump administration view that vat and the dst represent tariff rather than tax my hon friend remind that do not get chance to respond to the shadow secretary of state if follow these announcement in the united states we have come to parliament and say you know the answer to this be that low pay people will not get the sick pay they would otherwise have get under this labour government that would have be the wrong response again as ever that would be scapegoate the wrong people for difficult thing that have nothing to do with their position in the uk economy my hon friend skilfully leverage in number of question there be real difference of opinion between we and the united states on vat we say that it apply as it do to domestically produce good as much as to good that come into the uk and that it be not trade distort indeed the balance of trade between the us and the uk be evidence of that the argument from the us be slightly different will not go into the content of all the negotiation she will appreciate that but success in any negotiation be about be willing to be at the table and put forward our argument while recognise the other side argument that be the approach of this government and that be the way forward we must stand up to the bully that be trump and support british business this morning reach out to gooch housego manufacturer in torbay of fibreoptic that help to facilitate international communication it have interest in manufacturing in the us the uk europe and thailand it and other player in the high tech sector now have an extremely complex world to navigate how do the secretary of state plan to help the high tech sector navigate the challenging world that we now live in our job be to defend the uk national interest and the company in torbay that the hon member describe it sound like fantastic company be an exemplar of why want business to be base in the uk because they can then access whole range of market from the good possible position that be exactly the kind of company that because of complex supply chain will have question about what the announcement mean for it we decide to launch bespoke information on today to coincide with this announcement precisely to attempt to provide such company with the assurance that they need business like that can genuinely help we through this difficult period because whatever hon member think of the president and his agenda that agenda be base on return certain type of good quality manufacturing job to the united states and in many case british firm and british business already provide those they will provide more if we can find way through these trade tension and the imposition of tariff so they can work with we on the solution to these problem be grateful to the hon member for mention that company be pleased to hear the secretary of state commitment to steel stocksbridge speciality steels in my constituency be strategically significant site with world class unique capability for create specialist part that will be essential in increase our defence capacity and net zero infrastructure last week hold community listen event on the government excellent steel strategy the message be clear let we ensure that british make steel be good do the secretary of state agree that today news far demonstrate why it be so important that this government be commit to billion plan for steel greatly appreciate my hon friend advocacy for steel she put the case extremely well which be that the kind of product that we make in the uk steel sector and which in the main where we export they to the us be niche high value and in critical sector such as defence and the manufacture supply chain be complementary to the us that be good case of why believe there be no need and no argument for the imposition of tariff in the sector our steel sector be complementary to the us whether that be in defence or the manufacture supply chain that be the basis on which we can find way through this my hon friend be right to say that the level of domestic support have increase considerably through the steel strategy and the billion in total include port talbot that this government have put forward it be very important to we that we support the foundation industry the steel strategy be clear example of that from another steel constituency call martin vickers deal with the erratic trump administration must be something of nightmare for negotiation the unexpected can always emerge from the white house but one certainty be that tariff be go to form part of the trump agenda it be somewhat surprising that the minister be only today launch consultation about the implication of retaliatory measure build on the previous question about steel will the secretary of state at least acknowledge that the current uncertainty in the whole of the world market increase the pressure on the government to acknowledge that further support will be need for that industry be grateful to the hon gentleman for his comment he know that always have time for he to discuss the particularly challenging constituency issue that he face through the position at british steel just to be clear today announcement be the formal step necessary to engage with british business about last night announcement that be an important stage and the right way forward and we have be prepare for it in relation to the other challenge around the steel industry this be particularly challenging situation he and my hon friend the member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin know that well than anyone our commitment even in difficult circumstance be absolute we will continue with that and will continue to keep he and his constituent update at all time many of we may remember time when boris johnson and many of those on the conservative benches claim that trade deal with donald trump could increase our trade with the us by up to five time it be clearly more difficult than they think but it be important to learn from failure wonder whether the opposition have be in position to pass on any pearl of wisdom or any advice maybe even an oven ready deal that might help the country at this time of difficulty laughter be grateful to my hon friend have be in touch with lot of people who have be this country business secretary include some conservative colleague who remain in touch find that at time to be very useful and worthwhile thing can not tell my right hon friend that be in touch with boris johnson on this or any other matter on the work of the previous government nothing substantive be negotiate in the trade talk they have with the us this be very different situation but one where think if we get it right there be gain as say it be not just to avoid what be announce last night or before that on steel aluminium and automotive tariff but to genuinely improve that trading relationship to our mutual benefit tariff be always and everywhere diminution of the choice available to consumer so it be not liberation day it be the very antithesis hope the secretary of state will bear that in mind as he consider the policy and the consultation on any retaliatory action be grateful to the right hon gentleman for how he have put that think he be right on where the burden of policy fall in that area it be not in anyone interest no one win trade war that be impossible however it require we to react in way that be calm reassuring and pragmatic and which seek way forward can tell he that that be exactly what this government will seek to do thank the secretary of state and his colleague for all he have do so far in negotiate an economic partnership deal with the us the automotive sector be an incredibly important one for cheshire and merseyside both for manufacturer such as bentley vauxhall and jaguar land rover and the wide supply chain which support the employment of ten of thousand the us be the big export market for bentley motors in crewe so it be likely to be at the sharp end of the tariff we all hope that my right hon friend calm head approach have mean that we be in the good position to secure deal what specific support do he have in mind for the automotive sector to help it weather the storm my hon friend be right to highlight that be tremendously proud of our automotive sector indeed he may know that come from and grow up in one of our automotive sector powerhouse sunderland with the nissan plant it be incredibly important to lot of community in the supply chain all around the uk but particularly to our export the us be key market particularly for the high value model some of which he mention which be incredibly valuable to this country we want and seek to maintain that success on the kind of support first it be about deal with this issue secondly there be thing such as the announcement in the budget of the billion for collaboration with the private sector in the automotive field the money incentive for electric vehicle infrastructure and the change around the wide zev mandate that we be consult on and about to publish response to for which we need more pragmatic response than we have see in the past despite there be trade deficit and despite the good effort of this government include the secretary of state for whom have great deal of personal respect the reality be that we have still be hit by significant tariff from the states people at home right now will be worried about job inflation and the global headwind which will undoubtedly hit we irrespective of our own tariff situation one industry in particular back home in scotland that will be watch with eager eye be the scotch whisky industry give the billion of pound of export that go to the united states do not want the secretary of state to try and control nor could he trump tariff policy what he can do however be control his domestic taxation regime will he take this opportunity to re engage with the chancellor in and around the scotch whisky taxation status the right hon gentleman know the value that we place as department on the incredible product that be scotch whisky we have particular set of policy initiative on geographic indicator to make sure the brand be protect and always do everything can to support scotch whisky which be just absolutely world class and always will be he be right to say that our joint success in scotch whisky produce prominence that sometimes make it vulnerable to retaliatory measure because of the recognition of the success in that field on domestic policy remain in close contact with the chancellor on all matter and will do on this one there be tremendous opportunity for scotch whisky from some of the other trade negotiation that we be have such as with india in particular which be the big whisky market in the world as the right hon gentleman will know think there could be real step forward in term of our market access there and the arrangement that we have which will give we an advantage over other country and that be also prominent part of our work war do not benefit anyone trade war between the uk and its close ally will not benefit our industry nor our people and will stifle our ability to grow our way out of year of conservative mess for that reason thank the minister for his pragmatic and cool head approach however the measure also threaten our ability to prevent military conflict here on the continent of europe will he detail what action he be take to ensure that our air and space industry can work with our european partner to implement the defence industrial strategy which be central to ensure peace here in europe my hon friend be absolutely right in his assessment of the burden and benefit of solve the challenge we have be face with by the announcement yesterday evening he will know that the defence sector be one of the eight priority sector of our industrial strategy there be whole range of work across area like air and space that we be engage in with ministry of defence colleague of course we have also have significant increase in defence spending which be crucial part of how we respond to these threat the us will always be crucial security ally for we and our share interest whether they be economic or in the defence and security space be endure that be something we should always bear in mind as we try to find way through very much support the secretary of state concern about the automotive industry in this country will he therefore take action immediately to remove the arbitrary restriction on the ability of our domestic motor manufacturer to produce and sell vehicle with internal combustion engine the government policy have already reduce the domestic production of vehicle in this country by third between february last year and february this year why do he not lead by example and remove all tariff on us vehicle thank the hon member for his word on the automotive sector on the zev mandate that he reference it be policy of the previous government to be clear we inherit that policy the consultation we have open with our colleague in department for energy security and net zero and the department for transport will look at that in the context of fall across all european market in automotive production and demand and this incredible entry on to the world economy of increase chinese production which be challenge for all of we he will also know that the automotive sector be very much an export lead sector we export of what we make and all our key market have the transition policy in place towards electric vehicle so if we do not make that transition we would not have product to sell in those key market we have to work with industry to do it but we also have to recognise that what we inherit from the conservative party be not work that be why we open the consultation and we will publish the response very soon thank my right hon friend for his statement and for his effort and those of his team thus far also welcome the fact that there will be engagement with business on the potential for retaliatory action that input be vital while the uk have the low rate of reciprocal tariff that will be cold comfort to the many business in my constituency of bathgate and linlithgow and indeed for those in the whisky and salmon industry which employ thousand of people across scotland will the secretary of state assure the business community that he will work at pace with his team to secure sustainable trade deal with low tariff and to bring much need certainty to business and household across this country thank my hon friend for her support we be take step to ensure that all option be on the table for the action we may need to take in future that be important it be inevitable when an announcement of this magnitude have occur that business will be concern and understand that will be what her constituent be tell she this morning absolutely assure she that the approach have lay out today will be something that we continue to work towards at pace our tone the assurance we can give and the fact we be approach this with calm head pragmatism be vital and that will be part of how we can reassure business we will work to get to the position she articulate well set of trade term with the us and that be the objective of the government the business secretary say in his statement true strength come in make the right choice at the right time will he assure parent carer and young people up and down this country that he will show true strength with donald trump and his sidekick elon musk and make the right choice by refuse point blank to trade away our child safety online in water down in any way shape or form the implementation of the online safety act do believe that strength come in make the right choice at the right time in our national interest can tell the hon member that the talk have have with my us counterpart be not to do with what she have articulate they be to do with good service the regulation of professional body and all the thing we would associate with normal trade talk the united states be not seek to make our child unsafe or more vulnerable that be not the right approach to take to our key and core ally think sometimes the liberal democrats be invent problem to try to propose that they be the solution this be conversation about trade and it be vital that we keep it in those important and appropriate term there be threat but there be also an opportunity what measure be my right hon friend take to combat trade leakage and the diversion of good produce in country hit by high us tariff which may dump their product in the uk undercut our domestic producer what step be he take to encourage manufacturer base in those country and indeed in the eu to relocate to the uk and export from here to the us to take advantage of our low tariff be grateful to my hon friend for raise one of the most important issue we face the impact of trade diversion not just the relationship between the us and the uk but what it mean for good that potentially would have go to other country come to the uk market that be something we have to be extremely vigilant about he will know that we have those safeguard in place on the tariff already announce on steel and aluminium and that we have our own quota and tariff to protect domestic production to ensure that that be not the case can tell he that we stand ready to use those power for any sector of the economy that we need to use they for or indeed to take further power if that be deem to be necessary want business to be base in the united kingdom and to serve whole range of market from the united kingdom that pitch be not just about the comparative position we find ourselves in but about the kind of policy we put in place to ensure we have the level of competitiveness we need that be something that every country in the world be engage in but assure my hon friend not so much on the announcement last night but on the wide agenda of the government that that be our commitment tariff be tax on import pay by domestic business as the business secretary reflect over the forthcoming week and consult with business will he reflect on the taxis he have raise on our own domestic business and think about whether that be an appropriate response to what be happen we always reflect on the decision we have make as the uk government say to the hon member again we have probably have this exchange few time that be always willing to hear from the conservative party how it plan to fund its spending plan but it certainly do not set that out in the spending plan we inherit if the conservatives be ready to make decision on that we would love to hear from they but until they do so they should stop criticise we for fix their mess hope the secretary of state agree that protectionism be not the way to protect consumer and business our own history teach we that the tory corn law keep work people impoverished for generation in this country hope our approach will be that we should have free and fair trade with other country and not see rise price for british people american people or people anywhere else in the world and that we will do our good to ensure that people living standard rise by ensure the fair and free flow of good and service we have talk about not relive the argument of brexit my hon friend have bring up the corn law it be about time we have that one again he will know that if we go back to argument from the past such as those around imperial preference and look at the stance the labour party take it be always for free trade that be because free trade make food and other good and service cheap for the people we represent that have always be our history and our commitment what we be announce today and how we be seek way through these difficult and disappointing set of announcement be entirely consistent with our own history in the labour party and our commitment to internationalism diolch yn fawr madam dirprwy lefarydd some commentator be fawn over tariff simply because our near neighbour have be hit bad let get real the tariff on steel and aluminium will hit wales big export to the us machinery and transport equipment the eu be wales great trading partner with welsh export value at billion in the face of the american president obsession with international economic revenge do the secretary of state recognise that it be economic common sense to accelerate the scrapping of trade barrier with europe be grateful for that question again the right hon lady can see that no one in this government be fawn over the relative position we find ourselves in that be why we be so determined to find well way through she be right to say that the announcement on steel and aluminium be real danger to we particularly the potential for derivative tariff that is on product that be not the raw steel or aluminium but be produce from they that be why we be take this so seriously we have an ambitious commitment to the eu reset we need partner on the other side there have be some relative political instability in some key european partner and they have to be in position to have that conversation but say again that this be not choice between the us and the eu we can tackle this together we can improve our trading relationship with both partner and with india the gulf and other part of the world and it be the commitment of this government to do so in january the then conservative foreign secretary claim that the uk would be first in line for us trade deal day later when the conservatives leave office precisely nothing have be achieve incidentally that is time long than the day president trump have be in power for his second term do the business secretary agree that it be hard to take the conservative party criticism of our trade approach seriously give its appalling record on meet its claim to be able to achieve trade deal urge he to continue with his calm approach to this in the interest of business in basingstoke and across the country and to take those decision in the national interest be grateful for my hon friend support there be no real progress on federal level with the us under the previous government the former president make the decision that he would not pursue trade deal so there be perhaps not much they could do on that but do sometimes reflect that the conservative government break our relationship with our near and most important trading partner which be the european union they then fall out with country in the gulf and could not do that deal they could not do the deal with india and they would not engage with china for global britain policy there be not much of the globe leave if we find ourselves in that position that be not good practice for we to follow but we welcome conservative members support for our approach if it exist and continue to say that this be surely the right way forward for all our constituent farming textile and whisky be all important part of the economy in the scottish borders and across scotland more broadly and they will be affect by these tariff there be also real concern in scotland that product currently head to the united states market from other country will be redirect and dump into the uk market which will impact the domestic market what action be the government take to address that will the secretary of state undertake to engage with the national farmers union of scotland the scotch whisky association and other representative of industry in scotland to ensure that this problem be tackle head on agree this be one of the principal issue that we have to address whether it be on farming textile or whisky what be go on in the rest of the world and other country relationship to the us have direct impact even though that do not relate directly to the conversation about tariff and our own trade deal with the us be meet the chair and chief executive of the trade remedies authority imminently this be crucial part of the work that we have to get right we have some measure in place for steel and aluminium but we have to ensure that we be ready for other sector of the economy too many of my constituent work at jaguar land rover or in the motor manufacturing supply chain and they be really concerned about tariff on export to the us can the secretary of state set out what step he be take to get those tariff reduce and to support west midland business before meet jaguar land rover later today do he agree that calm and measured approach be exactly what be need to get the good deal for british business jlr be an example of an incredible uk base business in term of its success in the us china and other part of the world we want to maintain that and give that business the platform it need for that success be in regular contact at the most senior level with jlr be delighted to hear that my hon friend be meet it today to share some of these message of reassurance know that like all business it support this calm pragmatic rational approach to find well trade relationship with the us not just to avoid the imposition of what be announce yesterday evening the previous government undertake secretive trade negotiation with the usa that include health will the secretary of state assure the house that in any bilateral discussion with the usa there will be no question of us private healthcare interest come into britain to undermine our national health service or indeed take over section of it the right hon gentleman know that do not comment on the detail of talk but can tell he that there have be no discussion in relation to the nhs or anything that would concern he in that regard this be about good and service and how we recognise each other standard there be nothing relate to the health sector that have be able to talk about with us counterpart hope he find that reassuring the automotive industry be incredibly important for worker in milton keynes with many headquarter base there such as volkswagen realise that these tariff will be incredibly difficult for the automotive sector and it be good to hear what the secretary of state say about look for pragmatic approach to the zev mandate what else will he be do to support the automotive industry here in the uk thank my hon friend for his support he have some tremendous business base in his area and it be great have he here as champion for they in term of the automotive sector it be about the regulatory environment which we have discuss and it be about the funding that we make available for co investment with the private sector which be always priority and billion be allocate for that in the budget we have to accelerate and improve our electric vehicle charge infrastructure and there be million for that in the budget the pressure on the automotive sector across europe be fierce that be widely recognise with change in consumer demand and much more competition from china come into the market we have to be serious about make sure that the uk be the place to be producer of automotive vehicle my personal commitment to that be very strong thank the secretary of state for his response so far on northern ireland trust that he will continue to engage with my colleague in the northern ireland executive in the day ahead however he have not be able to allay my fear about the possible inclusion of online safety in any us deal can he reassure and the molly rose foundation that no more young life will be sacrifice in order to try to get deal with the us as say update the first minister and deputy first minister yesterday it be particular situation that we need to remain very much align to make sure the system be work as it should difficult as that will be the hon lady know that will not go into the specific negotiation on any part of deal but say seriously to any colleague that their concern be misplace if they think this be what the negotiation be about it be about good and service and regulation and that be what we be focus on deliver the prime minister have rightly say that this labour government will always work in the national interest so can the secretary of state assure the house that it be in our national interest to protect the copyright of our creative industry and the billion of economic power they bring to great britain the creative industry be not just wonderful cultural asset to the uk but tremendous economic asset as well do not necessarily agree with the commentary in part of the medium that posit tension between be creative powerhouse and support the tech sector there be way through that and that be what my work in government seek to achieve think we all recognise the economic impact on the uk of our creative sector the cultural soft power that come from it and the huge asset it represent that be always first and foremost in our thought it be estimate that job directly link to the automotive sector be at risk due to reduce export to the united states that be deep concern to many of my constituent who work at either jlr in solihull or aston martin in gaydon can the secretary of state set out what specific step he be take to protect those job and whether it will involve reform the regulatory environment in which they operate have see the institute for public policy research report that contain that figure because the automotive sector be such jewel in our crown we be all aware of what would happen if we be not able to find way through this our work to find that deal and remove this threat of tariff be intend precisely to deliver that way through meet aston martin yesterday as an example of the work we be try to do the hon gentleman ask specific question about the regulatory environment we inherit can not pre empt the publication of the consultation which have just finish but he will be aware of comment have make publicly about change that to reflect different circumstance he will not have to wait long for the outcome to be publish and can tell he that the secretary of state for transport the secretary of state for energy security and net zero and be align on ensure that we get the regulatory environment correct for the future thank the secretary of state and his colleague for the practical and pragmatic approach they have take to put we in the good possible position with the us do he agree that as well as the us political and economic co operation with our european friend and neighbour be essential and in our good interest it absolutely be and there be no tension between those two thing as have say it be false choice if people try to present it in that way and be particularly look forward to some of the progress that hope we will make in our relationship with the european union it be look not to the past but to the future and of course it be in both our interest to do so the us be clearly seek concession from the uk and it have be widely speculate that the uk government be consider reduction in the digital service tax as way of placate trump and his ally elon musk my hon friend the member for st albans daisy cooper ask the secretary of state this question but do not quite catch an answer in his response will he commit today not to cut the digital service tax as that be the way the tech giant pay their fair share here in the uk the hon lady have hear say repeatedly that will not go into specific negotiation but ensure that not just us tech company but any tech company pay fair rate of taxation in the uk for the economic activity that it have in the uk be something that all part of the british government be commit to she do not need to be worried about that in any discussion there will always be lot of issue that need to be deal with in the main those be trade issue understand that there be all kind of speculation but speculation be not always correct ask all colleague to bear that in mind and understand that we can not publicly share every single aspect of such negotiation if she be worried about us tech company or any tech company pay the right rate of tax in the uk let say that that be something we be deeply committed to do the secretary of state agree that now be time for unity across the chamber in the national interest in contrast to the politicking that we have early from the shadow minister will he commit that this labour government will always put country first and party second absolutely country first would hope that all member of the house could get behind the approach we be take which be genuinely in the national interest that be the way forward and the way to deliver what all our constituent want in these trouble time which be much well path towards the future appreciate the tone of concern with which the secretary of state have come here today be particularly concerned about what these measure mean for the uk defence industry particularly company such as bae systems in fylde and across lancashire that manufacture component part for us uk defence programme such as the what conversation have he have with those in the ministry of defence about work with their us counterpart to address this issue from national security perspective for both the us and the uk can he give an assurance that the order of fighter jet that the raf need to place will not be use as bargaining chip in any trade deal and that british build typhoon jet will be use for the raf thank the hon gentleman for his question have constituency interest that be similar to his and the close alignment between ourselves and the us on defence and security matter be an enduring and huge asset to both country so share the sentiment he have raise he ask whether we can engage us part in this conversation about more constructive way forward yes that be always part of our thinking and our trading body in the uk have excellent us link in the main and they engage in similar activity around that on his specific point have no detail to give he have no knowledge of anything like that be use as bargaining chip but if need to give he additional information be happy to write to he to provide that bracknell be home to the uk and european headquarters of many us company as well as to many uk business that do business in america can the secretary of state assure business in bracknell that this government position be that barrier to trade be bad for growth on both side of the atlantic and that he be work hard with cool head to secure trade deal my hon friend be right bracknell have some tremendous business such as honeywell dell and so he will be seek to promote and defend particular constituency interest have have tremendous support for the approach that have map out today not just from uk business but from us business as well particularly those with an economic relationship with the uk right now people be seek evidence that country around the world be try to deal with this difficult situation in the right way in their own national interest but also in way that give we an opportunity to strengthen rather than weaken those important trading relationship it be clear that the uk need to show some backbone in stand up to the us president bullyboy tactic on trade the secretary of state say that he be keen to negotiate deal but at what cost what be he put on the table can he assure the house that in seek carve out from president trump tariff he be not prepared to offer president trump and his big tech billionaire buddy an opportunity to carve up the nhs our environmental and food standard or our sovereign right to make our own decision on tax digital giant the hon lady will have hear the answer have give to some of the question she raise and the unequivocal assurance have be able to provide she talk about backbone backbone and strength strength and wisdom be not oppose value backbone come from put our own national interest first and negotiate on basis in the interest of all our constituent not bandy around rhetoric and escalate the situation that respectfully be not the right way forward the right way forward be to engage on national interest make sure we be deliver and have the chance to find the right way through this thank the secretary of state and his team for the enormous amount of hard work they have put in on this issue it feel apt to mention that represent the town of kirkcaldy the birthplace of adam smith who be sure would have have something to say about last night event my right hon friend be keenly aware of the importance of the us market for scottish export include but not limit to salmon and whisky which know he be very fond of what further reassurance can he offer to scotland lead export industry about the impact of these development on trade with the us be tremendously grateful for my hon friend support and for her question adam smith be probably the good historical reference we have have in this statement so far as she know have always aspire for my department to be one of the most pro scottish uk ministry because of the interest that we be there to defend and promote she will also know that this week be tartan week in the us the secretary of state for scotland be in the us right now and admire the way that he have turn the scottland office into such an economically focused department work with scottish business and work closely with that be tremendous initiative and one that we will continue to promote trump tariff will make everyone poor and be extremely disappointing so be it noteworthy that reform members have not bother to turn up to share in our disappointment our automative sector be already announce closure and layoff include stellantis in luton which have provide great job for my constituent for many year in his review of the regulatory environment in response to these tariff will the secretary of state ensure that it will be easy not hard to create job in the uk in future thank the hon gentleman for that question and he be right to note some conspicuous absence from the chamber on such an important subject could not make it clear care great deal not just about the transition to new technology in the automotive sector but about ensure that we make those vehicle in the uk we face tremendous competitive pressure as he will know from the story his constituent tell he we must be alert to that and willing to be adaptable to ensure that we be place where vehicle can be make we have some tremendous industry if we chart the productivity and efficiency of some of our plant on global scale we see that be at the top end we must get that policy and regulatory environment right and give the hon gentleman total assurance that that be my personal objective thank my right hon friend for his statement and for all the work that he have do so far in negotiate an economic partnership with the united states he will appreciate that the low levy apply to the uk will be of cold comfort to my constituent who will see their bill rise can he assure that he will resist call for knee jerk reaction to this the escalation of trade war will not help anybody and the way we achieve negotiate settlement be through constructive dialogue and calm approach say that as somebody who spend odd year as negotiator prior to enter this house my hon friend be formidable negotiator as have see at first hand we might see if she be available for some of the work we have to do she be right that this be about deliver for our constituent who must be concern when something of this magnitude have be announce no one in government or in any part of the chamber be relax about the relatively well position we find ourselves in because it be still something that we have to find way through we must keep all option on the table that be behind some of the announcement make in the statement but the approach that my hon friend advocate and promote be my approach and thank she for her support watch the secretary of state on television this morning and thank he for his calm collect and carefully choose word he understand my real concern about northern ireland business my stomach be do somersault worry about the impact for northern ireland my party leader my right hon friend the

for his question and for his kind word it have be quite week so far and we still have some way to go this be an issue not just for northern ireland members but for all member of the house we have to be alert to the particular situation that would occur if there be different retaliatory stance from we and the eu that be why brief the first minister the deputy first minister and my counterpart yesterday the shadow minister be right that the issue around the duty reimbursement scheme be key on the formal step that we have take business can now input their concern and what the tariff will mean to they directly to government we need to work together particularly in relation to northern ireland to ensure that specific voice and that specific question be key part of how we look at the issue and respond be keen to work with the hon gentleman in that regard may echo the thank to the secretary of state and the prime minister for the calm and effective way that they be deal with the united states unlike some of the frivolous comment we have hear from conservative members do my right hon friend agree that the us tariff on eu good be to be deeply regret as it could indirectly affect the many uk business that supply component to eu manufacturer that export to the us particularly in the automotive aerospace and pharmaceutical sector what discussion have he have with european counterpart about the us decision how he will represent our concern to they in the come day if there be an escalation of tariff my hon friend be right that our concern have to be not just about what this mean for our own relationship with the united states but about the second order impact on the uk from the trading relationship change between the us and other key ally and market no discussion on trade or tariff be complete without bring up rule of origin the complexity of some of the supply chain particularly in the automotive industry be key issue we have to ensure that we have preferential tariff access to market and that the product we make in our country qualify for those under the rule of origin we be closely engage with all partner he will know that the minister for the cabinet office my right hon friend the member for torfaen nick thomas symonds deal with the eu reset but we will continue to have very close working relationship as well as have direct conversation with our european commission counterpart in answer to question so far the secretary of state seem to have dismiss the threat of the us trade negotiation to the safety of our child be sure he have see the abandonment of content moderation on social medium platform and hear what trump vance and musk have say about free speech in our country what they mean be the freedom of us social medium giant to keep our child addict to their platform no matter how harmful the content know the secretary of state say that he do not want to get into the specific of the negotiation but be the online safety act part of those negotiation or will he take the opportunity to rule that out want to be clear with colleague not to invent problem that do not exist be aware of comment that have be make about freedom of speech in the uk they have not be part of the trade negotiation the hon gentleman recognise that can not share detail of negotiation but then he ask to share those detail he know that be not go to do that because it would not be in our national interest however say to colleague that these negotiation be about good and service in the main it be important to focus on that let we not make this more difficult than it be west bromwich be metal industry heartland we be home to the confederation of british metalforming and many brilliant export business be in the automotive steel and aluminium supply chain this morning speak to the chief executive of william king one of those brilliant local business and she be clear that the government be right to remain calm and to work to do the deal while ministers be work towards that deal what else can we do to support those business to continue to trade and invest with confidence that be the right approach to take welcome my hon friend support and that of the business in her constituency that she mention of course we be try to find way through this but give the situation we inherit after the election our domestic competitiveness be not what it could be and what it need to be even conservative members recognise the impact of aspect of regulation energy price and the direction of travel the output of foundation industry last year and this year be at level that should concern we all we have to get that right which be why this government be commit to an industrial strategy and trade strategy that work in partnership with it as well as endorse our approach the feedback from business be that that be exactly what they want west bromwich be powerhouse but want it to be an even big powerhouse in the future and the same apply to the constituency of many member across the house the tariff announce by trump last night will be concern for many business in the uk not least british farmer include in my constituency of stratford on avon we all recognise that trump will use the imposition of tariff to try to get concession from country around the world will the business secretary reassure the whole country and commit today that he will not agree to any deal with the us that would lower food standard and undermine british farmer the hon lady will have hear say very clearly that we be committed to the sanitary and phytosanitary regime as set out in the labour manifesto the uk be currently the big importer in europe of us agriculture so we should not present this as something that we do not already have that the us be try to open up we have strong mutually beneficial relationship british agricultural product be premium product that have tremendous reputation whether in the us or in other part of the world seek to remove trade barrier on both side while maintain the sps regime in uk which be very important to our other trading relationship be vital but that could be positive story of how we open up more market to excellent us product that be fundamentally what good trade policy be about thank the secretary of state for come to the house and for his calm head in difficult situation my constituency be home to many business include wright flour bacon harlow group and raytheon that trade directly and indirectly with the us what reassurance can the secretary of state give to those business and their consumer do he think that raytheon work source uk part for its defence system will be increasingly vital in the month and year to come be grateful to my hon friend for his support and for mention some of the excellent local business in his area on the impact of the pandemic and the war in ukraine on supply chain the private sector have be work with government to look at vulnerability to ensure we do not have strategic weakness we intend to include that vital work in the trade strategy which be due to be publish imminently but that aspect of economic security be extremely important the secretary of state can not have fail to notice the number of member from all party who have raise the food and drink industry particularly in scotland where many product be make in my constituency admire his approach of speak softly and carry big stick as he prepare his plan but retaliatory action be not the only lever that we could pull in discussion with the chancellor would he be prepared to offer some sort of mitigation to business in the food and drink industry in the autumn statement the hon gentleman have skilfully raise issue relevant to the autumn statement that be more for the chancellor than for product from the food and drink industry form prominent part of our economic export because of that industry success and what it mean to the prosperity of every bit of the united kingdom it feature heavily in all our decision whether on trade business support export support or the wide regulatory and policy environment assure the hon gentleman that his constituent and the excellent and successful business in his area be always prominent in our thinking thank the secretary of state for his hard work and for his calm and pragmatic approach in my constituency of aylesbury there be almost small and medium sized business several of which export to the us or have be seek to do so will the secretary of state set out what he be do to protect our sme in his ongoing negotiation with the trump administration fundamentally want to see great market access to the us for small and medium sized business in every part of the uk we can tackle particular thing as part of that such as the regulatory system in the united states and the federal state dichotomy particularly for service and export all that be the prize on offer if we get this right big part of trade policy be also about not just free trade agreement even though they tend to get the most prominence but how we come to agreement on commerce and function of online marketplace and transaction all that be very practical difference that we can make through good trade policy to small and medium sized business that will be premium and important part of the trade policy we be about to publish the pharmaceutical sector appear temporarily to have avoid tariff but that may well change however medical device and diagnostic do not appear to have that same exemption the uk be home to many medtech and diagnostic company and the tariff will have an impact on they both here and abroad and may well push up price what conversation be the secretary of state have with colleague in the department of health and social care about ensure access to medtech and diagnostic in the face of increase price thank the hon gentleman for his question he may be aware of the biopharma conference hold in the uk yesterday with the top chief executive officer of many of the lead company in this area it be attend by myself the prime minister the secretary of state for health and social care and the secretary of state for science innovation and technology the hon gentleman be right to say that we could see further announcement in this area there be particular us issue such as the differential in drug pricing which have always be fairly prominent part of trade negotiation there be an integration and share aspiration between people in government such as myself and the health secretary and recognition of our need to be more forward lean to use more innovation to look at how we provide that and the relative allocation of resource in our exist health system we take that very seriously and we be very much look at that there be lot to do and it be difficult situation but we need more of the success that the hon gentleman outline thank the secretary of state for his statement the announcement of tariff on all product export from the uk to the united states mean that for the second time in just five year the scotch whisky industry could be impact by tariff in the industry large global market that will be concern news across community where scotch whisky be major employer include in my constituency scotch whisky make up quarter of all scottish export to the us but it be not one way traffic to give just one example the scotch whisky industry import up to million of ex bourbon cask every year urge the secretary of state to work with the us administration and ensure that mutually beneficial resolution can be agree as soon as possible to support the scotch whisky industry be incredibly grateful to my hon friend for his question and for his accurate insight into some of the co dependency and relationship that exist between scotch whisky and other key international sector of the food and drink economy if he ever want to come and see in my office in the old admiralty building keep bottle of lagavulin there which think we can all agree be an excellent choice you would be welcome to come for that conversation at any time madam deputy speaker we have to keep the number down but we will look at that if we come through with deal interruption of course the shadow secretary of state would also be very welcome to come what an excellent meeting we have just set up accidentally often an equivalence be make in some market between for instance the tariff on bourbon from the us and scotch whisky comparison be make and those be often see as compete product but there be an interdependency as well the point about the sherry barrel be also really important and fascinating can tell my hon friend that we be in regular contact with the scotch whisky association which be tremendously supportive as resource to we and be very closely engage with government these issue which be so important to his constituency be always consider and prominent at the high level in government thank the secretary of state for his statement and congratulate he on his choice of whisky that be my favourite as well there be no winner in this dire situation we think of the people wake up this morning in vietnam cambodia and so on but we have to acknowledge that the cool head in government have mean at least for now as we start this process that the job of people in edinburgh south west have be save do no doubt that as we speak business in my constituency and across the uk be try to figure out what this mean for they so we have to redouble our effort in our search for growth welcome the pragmatic word give around the zero emission vehicle mandate ultimately without compromise our aim we can work together with business and trade union to get well outcome but wonder if the same approach can be take elsewhere the ai regulation that we have be discuss which think be mention early come to mind interruption will be very quick madam deputy speaker there be also hfss advertising and the sustainable aviation fuel mandate we do not need to compromise on all those thing but we can work closely with industry to get the right outcome warmly welcome my hon friend word and his endorsement and seconding of my whisky choice should say that other excellent whisky be available lot of scottish members be present and do not want to offend anyone he be right to say that business will need reassurance hope they will get that from the tone that the government be strike today but they will need information if member get out their phone and go on to they will see link to bespoke page where that information be provide we have advertise around that my hon friend make an important point where we can look at alleviate some of the domestic pressure whether through regulation or other area this be clearly the time to do so have have those conversation with cabinet colleague he be right to say that this be not about change policy but about look at the impact right now and how we can make difference that be very wise observation to make commend my right hon friend for the measured tone he have take on event in washington want to reflect on the agency we have here in london and with our ally in brussels do the secretary of state agree that now be the moment to seek the most ambitious trade deal we possibly can with the european union seek deep alignment in good and service furthermore while the united states may want to make it hard to trade do he agree that the uk eu reset provide we with an opportunity to break down the barrier to trade that the conservatives put up when they be in government if we get this right the prize on offer from the uk eu trade deal could be even great than what be lose overnight warmly thank my hon friend for his question and his support for the approach we be take believe there be competitive advantage to seek for the uk where we be able to reach agreement with the us we be able to do those trade deal and negotiation with country such as india or custom union such as the gulf co operation council and also to get the eu reset right although this be not about look to the past lot of small business stop export entirely after brexit they almost certainly set up subsidiary in the single market which be not to our advantage and we see real decline in certain type of food and drink trade even though we have broadly similar sps regime in place we can work on those practical thing and that be our objective there be real gain to be have from that we need partner on the other side who see the benefit as well but believe that they exist and that be crucial focus for what we call the twin track approach to trade under this government thank the secretary of state for his statement and for the work he be do as we face this challenge welcome the government commitment to increase defence spending that be good for not just our national security but our economy the sector employ many people in derbyshire include at rolls royce as we seek trade deal that will create the economic condition for our public service to thrive and for price and bill to remain as low as possible can encourage the secretary of state to remind the us of the importance of manufacturer such as rolls royce and the defence sector and the strategic and economic partnership they offer we so that we can work with they more constructively those be very wise word and be grateful to my hon friend for put they on the record defence spending be crucial for our national security the big change and uplift that we have see be big part of that but he be right to say that it would be wrong for anyone in this country to think there be not domestic economic dividend for that those job be spread all around the united kingdom include in place that be really reliant on they so it be great news on the economic front for all part of the uk and derbyshire rolls royce be great example of that my hon friend talk about how we can get this right with our relationship to the us we already have some great thing under way we can think about the aukus agreement in which the us treat domestic uk supplier as part of the domestic supply chain there be equivalence there we can think about steel and the role that sheffield forgemasters play for instance that be crucial part of the defence supply chain for the us these be really important and mutually beneficial strength to recognise if we look at the fact and at how our trade dependency work there be great prize on offer if we get this right call david pinto duschinsky to ask the final question thank you madam deputy speaker joy as ever thank my right hon friend and the prime minister for their tireless effort which have secure the good most powerful position available for our country of course there be deep disappointment that tariff have be levy but the fact that they have be levy at the low band be vindication of the government strategy and business have speak to in hendon and nationally have be unanimous in their support for the government approach do my right hon friend agree that the good way to stand up for britain be through cool calm collected and pragmatic approach and that we must reject the jerk response and call for action on invent problem that some opposition members demand be extremely grateful to my hon friend for his question he have articulate our approach which be that we be not complacent or happy we be disappoint about any tariff be impose on the uk we recognise that the low band have be apply to the uk but that do not mean that we will not redouble our effort to secure an agreement that offer way through be grateful for the support of my hon friend constituent hear in every part of the country that our approach be genuinely the one that business want we to take it be calm be not sure whether it be cool and hope reassure to business in my hon friend area lot of people be always offer advice in this area at time they be offer to escalate conflict and perhaps do not have plan to de escalate it but this government approach be always to pursue our national interest work with partner and look at the mutual benefit we could get from do thing right be extremely grateful for the support for that policy from member in all part of the house today that mark the end of the very lengthy statement on uk us trade and tariff child in temporary accommodation england housing communities and local government committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement florence eshalomi will speak on behalf of the housing communities and local government committee for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of her statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement they should be brief question rather than full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair not the minister front benchers may take part in questioning today the housing communities and local government committee publish our first report of the session follow our inquiry on child in temporary accommodation thank the backbench business committee for kindly grant time for this statement and the committee staff for their assistance in produce the report this morning over child wake up without permanent roof over their head their parent be unable to sleep worry about make the long journey to work and school about the state of their accommodation and about when they will finally get home of their own give that the number of child in temporary accommodation rise by in the last year alone we know that there will not be an overnight fix to this problem that be why our committee first inquiry of this parliament focus on the story of child in temporary accommodation and the impact that the increase amount of time family be spend in what should be temporary accommodation be have on those child how can we expect child to have the good start in life when they be live out of suitcase how can we expect they to grow up without the basic of private bathroom or kitchen and how can we expect they to be ready for school if it take they hour to get there on route that be always change when family with child become homeless their local authority have duty to provide housing for they until they can settle in more permanent home this temporary housing could be privately rent property short term social housing council own property or nightly pay accommodation such as bed and breakfast or hotel our inquiry find that far too often temporary accommodation be completely inappropriate for family and in some case be unfit for habitation we hear about case of family live in accommodation that be excessively cold that have serious damp and mould and that have mice infestation temporary accommodation be often overcrowded sometimes old child have to share bed with their parent or sibling and baby can not crawl or learn to walk due to lack of floor space however that accommodation be cost the public purse fortune in local authority in england spend around billion on temporary accommodation and london borough alone spend million day on temporary accommodation the cost of homelessness service have lead to at least one local authority apply for exceptional financial support from the government representative of local authority across england who we hear from during our inquiry all agree that the cost of temporary accommodation be utterly unsustainable even the term temporary accommodation be misleading because these placement be often far from temporary as of march more than family have be in their temporary accommodation for over five year can any of we imagine start secondary school in year in temporary accommodation and still not have home of our own when we leave in year that be the reality for so many young people in so many family young people who be often voiceless out of sight and stick in completely unsuitable accommodation our report be therefore entitle england homeless children the crisis in temporary accommodation it be apparent to we that we have not only housing crisis in england but an acute crisis in temporary accommodation during our inquiry we hear about condition so appal that they be have negative impact on child health we hear that housing condition be contribute to respiratory illness sleep deprivation and mental health condition in child most shockingly we hear that temporary accommodation have be contribute factor to the death of at least child in the past five year of those child be under the age of one in one of the rich country in the world that be shameful that alone should inspire we all to act urgently and bring an end to this crisis before more innocent life be lose why then be local authority not require to inspect the quality of their temporary accommodation at all there be no requirement for local housing department to carry out in person check on the property be use our report recommend that local authority carry out mandatory inspection of housing before it be use as temporary accommodation as well as whenever new resident be place in that housing to ensure its basic suitability for child and family perhaps the bad form of temporary accommodation be bed and breakfast accommodation be rarely self contain mean that family must share facility with complete stranger we hear about alarming case of prison leaver share bathroom and kitchen with family and hear evidence that family have be place in housing with man with history of domestic abuse local authority must work with the government to put an end to those mixed placement in order to mitigate the clear safeguard risk in some area demand pressure have force local authority to place homeless child in temporary accommodation outside the area family be often leave with no choice but to move away from everybody and everything they know include their friend and support network sometimes not know when or if they will return for child an out of area placement can mean hour spend travel to and from school or need to move school entirely just last week new research from the children commissioner highlight stark link between the number of time child in temporary accommodation move school and low gcse result only of child who move home five time while at school achieve five gcse compare with of child who have only one home address while we be not able to consider this late evidence in our inquiry those finding demonstrate the point that we need to keep improve data collection and reporting across public service so that we can fully understand the health and education impact of child homelessness we also recommend that the government establish formalise notification system so that child school and gp be alert when they become homeless the government have set up an inter ministerial group which will publish strategy on end homelessness later this year while we welcome that announcement we recommend that the inter ministerial group consider the link between welfare reform particularly the re freezing of the local housing allowance and homelessness fundamentally england housing crisis be an affordability crisis and the same can be say about the temporary accommodation crisis we know what have cause this problem there have be failure of successive government over decade to deliver new home the committee support the government ambition to deliver million new home during this parliament but we also stand ready to help scrutinise those plan as they come forward we must ensure that these new home be safe of high quality and be genuinely affordable long term part of that strategy be national target to promote social or affordable rent home in the housing mix clearly build those home be the long term objective but the child in temporary accommodation and their family can not wait they need an immediate response from the government this be personal for still remember be place in temporary accommodation at bed and breakfast in king cross remember the joy and the relief of receive our home and the key it be somewhere we could build home and not have to carry belonging around in black bag sadly those child in temporary accommodation will have to wait year for that same feeling and they will continue to suffer under an unacceptable system for too long thank my fellow committee member and the many homeless organisation local authority and other who present evidence to our committee during this inquiry we look forward to receive the government response and commend the report to the house commend my hon friend not just on this report but on her strong leadership of the housing communities and local government committee in the report the committee describe the very real life of the child from my borough who be in temporary accommodation that be enough to fill eight primary school there be other impact too she talk about what the government be do and the report mention the report that be expect in july can she give the house any indication of when that report will come and what will her committee do to follow up on it thank my fellow chair the chair of the treasury committee this be really important as we say we welcome the government inter ministerial group which meet regularly to consider key finding it be vital that it work to end homelessness across the uk we be push the government to bring forward their strategy before the summer recess it be vital that local authority charity and organisation can plan before the summer holiday when sadly more child will be shunt from one borough to another if we do not get to grip with this issue commend the hon lady she have big heart and we thank she for her leadership of the committee it be right to address the issue of homeless child rental accommodation be too expensive we have high demand for social housing multiple family live in one household and mould and damp issue this report be excellent it lay out the issue but also put forward recommendation will she share it with the relevant minister in the northern ireland assembly be always happy to see the hon member in the chamber and he make an excellent point we have to make sure that we share our learning right across the uk include with northern ireland and be happy to do that thank my hon friend and chair of the select committee of which be member for present the report we hear compelling evidence during the inquiry do she agree that the government should look carefully at the evidence we hear about the impact of out of borough placement on child family and host borough particularly when think about future legislation thank my fellow committee member who bring her experience to the issue from her work with homelessness organisation local authority want to work with the government but they need to talk to each other more we will push the government far to ensure that local government be speak with one voice at the moment some borough be not notify each other it be vital that we look at that thank the select committee chair for bring this report to the chamber it relate to two of my previous role as have work as teacher and with homelessness charity so the subject be close to my heart what joint working have the committee do with the department for education and teach professional on the impact of be in temporary accommodation on learn also want to raise an issue that come up in harlow when work for homelessness charity the decision by the previous government do not think it be malicious to raise the housing element of universal credit lead to many private sector landlord raise their rent that have an impact on temporary accommodation because many people be be house in temporary accommodation in the private rent sector will the committee consider that thank my hon friend for his point and again commend he on the work he have do in this area which have hear he speak on in the chamber it be important that we recognise that the long term ambition be to build those genuinely affordable home but in the interim it be about how we work to address this important issue one way be ensure that this issue do not just sit with the ministry of housing communities and local government it have to be an inter department agenda and focus that be why we welcome the government cross departmental ministerial team look at this because the issue be not confine to mhclg but be about education and health too it be important that the departments continue to talk and that be one thing we will feed back as we get response from the government congratulate my hon friend and her committee on this crucial report as my constituency neighbour she know how much this be an issue within our borough and be sure she would agree that the end to no fault eviction in the renters reform bill will be positive step towards end the number of family who be evict with no cause and force into emergency and temporary accommodation our hon friend the member for harlow chris vince just speak about extortionate and unregulated rent increase in the private sector force family into temporary accommodation do the chair agree that the government should be look at regulate private rent essentially rent control so that they be affordable for the average family thank my neighbour and hon friend this issue sadly affect our borough of lambeth in the past year the data show that average rent have increase by and we know that many family income have not increase by that rate we need to look at how we get to grip with the private rent sector as have say the reality be that we can not build these home tomorrow so more people will continue to rent it be about work with local council housing association and other organisation to make sure that the rent be charge be fair most importantly we must ensure that condition in property be be address we be see situation where more than billion be be spend on accommodation that be frankly unreasonable and that be where we need to get to grip with what be happen thank my hon friend and the committee for bring forward this report too many child in beckenham and penge live in temporary accommodation and know from speak to local headteacher and other the impact that have on every aspect and every corner of their life from their education to their health and wellbeing do she agree that we will only make progress in improve outcome in other area when we have tackle this crisis as fellow south londoner my hon friend will recognise the pressure that many borough be face london council and all political party have come together to flag this key issue with the government it be not sustainable for london council to be spend million day on it it be vital that we continue to work with all departments if we be say that our child be the future it be important that they get the good start in life we have situation where child do not have space to crawl their first few year be hinder by that it be vital that we look at how we address and tackle this issue backbench business uk democracy impact of digital platforms beg to move that this house have consider the impact of digital platform on uk democracy be grateful to the backbench business committee for the opportunity to host this debate today and thank the sponsor and member here present for support it begin by pay tribute to jo cox and sir david amess two public servant murder in the name of hatred the very hatred and radicalisation that digital platform fuel we be fail whole generation we be fail young woman face unprecedented level of abuse and harassment we be fail young man be radicalise and exploit in plain sight we be fail democracy itself as misinformation and intimidation silence voice and distort political participation today digital age present new unparalleled threat to our democracy social media be not without its benefit it allow we to connect with constituent and promote cause indeed be sure that all of we would be look upon very unfavourably if we do not engage in the online space in some shape or form it have become one of the few way that young people engage with politic and it have play pivotal role in promote grassroots activism and great transparency however we now face national emergency of misinformation and digital violence family teacher and even young people themselves be cry out for an overhaul just this past month we have see stark reminder of the harm that digital platform enable the release of adolescence have rightly ignite national conversation about online misogyny and radicalisation expose the toxic digital culture infiltrate our home and classroom we only have to look at case like the murder of brianna ghey to see the horrifying real world impact the reality be that young man radicalise online do not just stay there they go out into the world and sometimes commit the most heinous act of violence the rise tide of online hate and radicalisation do not exist in isolation misogyny incel ideology and far right extremism among other be not just thrive in online space they be be actively cultivate by algorithm that be design to maximise engagement and profit that be really important point which will come back to later esther ghey brianna mum have call social medium an absolute cesspit and be sure that we all agree she have call for an ban and she be right to do so want to make it clear that this crisis be not confine to one country one background or even one ideology the name change but the pattern remain the same parent be terrified and teacher powerless and child be be exploit right under our nose all we have to do be look at the case of alexander mccartney prolific paedophile who sit in his bedroom in county armagh and abuse thousand of child across the world it be the uk large ever catfishe case involve man who use social medium to blackmail torment and sexually exploit child across the world when participate in discussion last year on the safe phone bill all the big social medium company be present after they have boast about how they self regulate ask they whether they be familiar with the alexander mccartney case congratulate the hon member on secure this debate and on all the campaign work that she be do do she agree that although there be some fantastic example of social medium be use positively to enhance democracy and political participation this be often reliant on benevolent and honest owner and that our democratic safeguard should not rest on the presumption of good will or honesty from technology giant absolutely and that be really timely point we should not outsource our child safety to social medium company indeed we hear in previous statement about the impact of content moderation and how it may or not form part of discussion on trade agreement as we move forward when sit in room with all the social medium company only one have hear of the alex mccartney case that tell we everything that we need to know about how seriously big tech take child safety it should not take tv show like adolescence to make the government wake up to what have be warp our society for year the action that they have take so far have be inadequate meet the creator of adolescence be indeed welcome but it be simply not enough commission more review talk about cultural change and tinker at the edge will not fix the problem we must speak to the platform in the only language they understand profit and loss we know what drive this issue algorithm content recommendation system and the financial interest of the big tech company actively steer vulnerable young people towards ever more extreme content this be not side effect it be their business model fundamentally this debate be about power who hold it who wield it and in whose name be they act right now big tech billionaire and online extremist be work hand in hand shape our child and democracy and warp our society this government have be too slow too weak and too capture by vested interest to stop they figure like andrew tate have build empire by manipulate young man into their world of violent misogyny lie and conspiracy tate have ingratiate himself with donald trump and elon musk but do he care about man not bit he exploit they this be not just an individual person behave irresponsibly it be co ordinate machine try to drown out critical voice spread misinformation and undermine public debate let we be honest agitator and bully like the tate brother have always exist what have change be the tool and the platform that they have at their disposal which give they access to young people in particular let we be clear their reach be not accidental andrew tate be amplify promote and monetise by the same platform that claim to be unable to regulate online harm this be not just about free speech it be about radicalisation and control powerful malign actor some overseas and some home grow be exploit our young people and our political system for profit social medium platform be not neutral they push extremist content deliberately algorithmically and at scale thank the hon lady for the clear way that she be lay out some of the issue that we be talk about today be lucky enough to be vice chair of the all party parliamentary group for fair election and one of our strand of work be on tackle myth and disinformation one of the call have hear be that at the very least the social medium giant should have duty to carry out risk assessment of legal but harmful content which cover some of the issue that she be talk about do she agree that that be the very least the platform could do thank the hon member for her comment and completely agree that that be the bare minimum that they should do report by hope not hate find that almost of boy age to in the uk have consume content from andrew tate on elon musk platform that have dismantle its trust and safety team tate video dominate young man feed if we allow this climate to continue we be hand digital platform the power to dictate political debate poison young mind and do irreparable damage to our democracy of course the loudest free speech warrior be the first to silence criticism as know from personal experience after call out elon musk for platforme extremism tate follower immediately descend on with flood of abuse and harassment that be not random it be deliberate attempt to silence an elect representative be bombard with death threat rape joke and abuse from account both local and international then the tate brother themselves come after two man run from the most serious criminal charge and prop up by the world most powerful leader they target an elect representative from northern ireland for dare to speak my mind it be not even about they it be about musk but it be calculated attempt to silence an elect politician be in their word nice target it be direct attack on democracy and on this house itself this be not just about individual it be about democracy we have see deliberate organised effort to create an online environment where extremism flourish where intimidation become the norm and where woman minority and political opponent be drive out of public life thank the hon member for secure this really important debate and for her passionate speech she highlight the ripple effect that will be create if we do not challenge social medium company in the last general election we see so many woman and black and minority ethnic candidate be target online by anonymous social media account and much of that go unchecked do she agree that if we do not deal with this issue we will see few people put themselves forward to stand for public office absolutely and thank the hon member for her contribution be really honour that she be here today because her voice be so important when be elect to the house last year be really proud to be here as part of diverse parliament that diversity be welcome across the house and be reflect on these benches that be good but have to be honest and say that we have hear from many parliamentarian not just here but across the uk that if they have know what be an elect representative would bring to their life they would not have step forward but that be exactly what we need because the social medium company want those voice to be silence this be not just about our agree with the political view we like absolutely not will defend to the hilt the right of people to express view that absolutely do not agree with because they need to be hear too the hon member make really important point and thank she for it the northern ireland electoral commission report on the uk general election lay bare that over half of candidate report harassment intimidation or abuse one in ten face severe abuse and woman be disproportionately target as be minority often by anonymous account the point just make by the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi the consequence be immediate nearly of candidate avoid solo campaigning and almost avoid social medium altogether this be system in which intimidation silence voice before they can even be hear have hear the same warning from colleague across this house and the chilling effect be real it be much big than this too let we be clear our democracy be under threat and the battlefield be not just in parliament or the ballot box but online where rogue state and billionaire tech mogul be manipulate public opinion for their own end the recent romanian presidential election should have be routine democratic process instead it become cautionary tale pro russian candidate who do not debate do not campaign and supposedly spend nothing suddenly surge to the top of the first round and the election be then annul that be digital interference in action warning for every european democracy include our own if member think that be just happen in romania they should think again here in the uk over half of the public say they see mislead information about party policy and candidate during the last general election nearly quarter of voter say they have encounter election relate deepfake while be not even sure if they have the scale of the problem be staggering democracy do not function when voter can not trust what they see or hear yet the people in control of these digital platform be not just bystander but active participant how be it that elon musk now sit in trump administration own one of the world big digital platform which have spiral into far right cesspit remember when we think silicon valley tech bro be go to make society well more open and more progressive those day be long go now they have taste power and they be in the white house endorse the afd alternative für deutschland in germany while their algorithm push misogynist and conspiracy theorist to the top of feed this be not glitch in the system this be the system it be system that reward the loud most divisive voice while drown out fact and reason debate if we care about democracy here in the uk we need to stop treat social medium giant as neutral platform and call they what they be political actor if we do not hold they to account we be not just allow misinformation to spread but hand they the key to our election on silver platter for online abuser anonymity be not protection it be weapon and overwhelmingly it be use against woman and minority for century democratic debate be base on people know who they be engage with anonymity once exist to protect the speaker from harm now it enable the speaker to inflict harm with impunity this be not about free speech it be part of political strategy co ordinate effort to undermine trust in institution silence opposition and create hostile environment for anyone who dare to challenge the status quo when those in power let this happen by drag their foot on game change legislation by gutte private member bill and by potentially scrap digital tax hand more money to the very platform on which these predator thrive they be send message it be message to every woman in public life and every girl in this country that their safety be not the government problem what need to be do we must deprive these hate figure and predator of the oxygen of publicity why be it be tolerate the online safety act be outdate before it be even fully implement it be too slow and too weak and the harm it be design to address have only worsen regulator lack the power to challenge big tech and ministers be too afraid to stand up to musk and trump every concession embolden these extremist there be no appease they and our child life can not be collateral damage in reckless pursuit of growth australia have take decisive world lead action it have introduce full ban on social medium for meanwhile the uk digital age of consent remain that mean child as young as year can legally sign up to platform awash with violent misogyny porn self harm content and extremist material what more proof do this government need the safe phone bill could have be game changer instead it be water down gutte and abandon why it be because this government prioritise big tech profit over our child wellbee we do not need any more review or consultation but we do need decisive courageous action while this government dither the average to year old now spend hour week more than full time job on their phone the hon lady be make genuinely powerful speech with really strong argument and commend she for it the government may be struggle to tackle the digital platform themselves but would useful first step be ban telephone in school up to the age of the hon member be absolutely right this be huge issue to grapple with but think the evidence be clear about what this have cause so far there be valid discussion to be have about the use of phone and school be possibly one of the only place where our child device will be take off they for set period but the issue be what be on the phone when they get they back for that be the point at hand to conclude who would want to be child grow up in this world today that question be really distress and disturbing it be world in which radicalisation be just click away misinformation spread like wildfire and people reputation be trash in second and it be one in which those who challenge it be meet with wall of co ordinate abuse know would not want to be grow up today with political donation foreign interference in election voter manipulation online bullying deepfake mental health problem and class disruption and that be just the tip of the iceberg sadly do not have time to cover it all but do know that we have moral duty to protect young people and future generation and truly believe that everybody in this house genuinely believe that and want to act on it this be now national security issue society in which young man be radicalise against woman be society that become more violent fractured and dangerous for we all we be at critical juncture the question before we be clear do we allow the like of andrew tate donald trump elon musk and other to profit from poison the mind of our young people or do we stand up for our child our country our democracy and the very fabric of our society the government must act and act now so ask what be stop we if not now when the time to act be today for the sake of our child and indeed our very democracy rise from the back benches for the first time in many year have resign from my position as minister for development and for women and equalities the view be much well from here as the late great robin cook say but do deeply regret that could not continue to serve in the government for which campaign for so long wish my successor baroness chapman and baroness smith all the very good will not try their patience or indeed yours madam deputy speaker by reprise the content of my resignation letter but do want to explain why have choose to break my silence during this debate the new government enter office at time of unprecedented geopolitical and economic flux there be no muscle memory in government or indeed in politic for the instability we be currently see and as democracy backslide globally instability be the new normal it demand strategic not tactical response economically believe as set out in my letter that we must be prepare to reassess shibboleth whether on the fiscal rule as germany have do or on taxation especially when the very well off be see so little impact on their wellbeing from the economic headwind in addition we must work with our ally particularly in europe but also beyond to build our resilience on defence production and export with productivity growth hammer by post brexit impediment to trade and now as we have hear this morning with us impose tariff from turkey to somalia people be desperate for democracy stability and economic growth in support they we also support our country security therefore regret that on top of the huge cut to official development assistance that lead to my resignation the shift to cash basis may limit resource far welcome the prime minister commitment to work closely with other country to bridge some of that gap but it must include radical action to tackle indebtedness increase financial guarantee protect lifesave health service and to support and reform multilateral body as they come under attack from autocrat believe that we need the same strategic approach not tactical when it come to the protection of our democracy last summer see the bad racist riot in our country since the second world war none of we can forget the appalling scene when racist thug set fire to hotel know that people remain inside and all in the name of three poor beautiful little girl may they rest in peace the policing and criminal justice response be swift and commend the government for that but in this case and other the influence of social medium have not be fully digest let alone act upon there be many other canary choke down the coalmine not least due to the growth and impact of violent online misogyny here commend the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood not just for her steadfast campaigning but for the fact that even as she have receive such appalling abuse herself she continue to stand for woman and girl stand in solidarity with she as should all member in this chamber considerable progress be be make to defend democracy by the new government through the taskforce of that name the joint election security and preparedness unit the foreign influence registration scheme that be release couple of day ago the speaker conference focus particularly on the safety of candidate and the new ban on the creation as well as the sharing of sexually explicit deepfake whether they be focus on politician or other victim but attempt to degrade our democracy have involve actor from state that be not classify as hostile and they have take place outside election time too policy must deal not with how thing be year ago but with the reality of an online world that be have huge offline consequence first agree with the hon lady that we lack tool to deal decisively with the growth in disinformation the online safety act do include measure to protect content of democratic importance but without clear definition of that content and with ofcom advisory committee on disinformation and misinformation apparently not have meet yet that must be remedie speedily give that over half of people now receive news through social medium and that rise to of young people recommender algorithm as she say privilege engagement above all else and extreme content engage more urge the government to consider include independent audits of recommender algorithm as contain in the eu digital services act but not in our online safety act secondly our new legislative regime although welcome rely on an antiquated separation of large and small platform last summer show how the far right often switch from telegram to youtube to rumble and to other platform large and small when they spread disinformation they do not keep it only on large platform so regulator should be prepare to act on small platform too thirdly the new regime be create when the major complaint against platform be that they be fail to heed their own rule now powerful platform owner be ditching rule and fire compliance officer and be themselves pump out disinformation there be no minimum standard in the new regime for platform term of service urge the government to look again at that with the care that know the minister always display finally we must work more closely with other seek to protect their democracy from helsinki to rio tallinn to ottawa and chisinau to berlin in that vein parallel the prime minister push for uk eu defence partnership we surely also need uk eu structure dialogue on digital policy and the defence of our democracy in conclusion remain grateful to the prime minister and my party for provide with eight month where could seek to serve my country as minister of state that be only possible because my constituent in oxford east afford through their free choice the opportunity to represent they voter free choice take for grant so often in our country but so precious be what be ultimately at risk if we fail to defend our democracy thank the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood for an excellent opening speech it almost make feel like put down my own speech because think there be nothing more could contribute thank she so much for that introduction it be worth say that the people who will be speak in this debate be probably not fearful of technology itself consider myself digital native grow up with msm and myspace and enjoy the connectivity that social medium bring to we all it have transform our society in way that be for the good but without doubt we do have problem we have big problem with content we have big problem with addiction and as the hon lady articulate so clearly we have problem with power will begin with content there have be huge rise in the level of hate misogyny violence and pornography we be see on our social medium feed be certain that be not imagine that be sure that the stuff that pop up on my for you feed on be not there few year ago prior to musk ownership the sort of thing that have be push towards as youngish man be an absolute disgrace few month ago there be knife crime incident in my community just yard away from my office the footage of it circulate online within minute again be sure be not kid myself that handful of year ago that piece of content would eventually have be take down today meta facebook have show no interest in take that down that shocking footage be still circulate around my community and shame on they for that that sort of content rise to the top of algorithm because it be emotionally charge it disgust it enrage and it spark fear that work for social medium company because that be how they generate their profit when we apply that kind of emotionally charge content to news it be no long judge by its veracity or the insight it provide but by its ability to provoke with the result that misinformation travel much more quickly than the truth on addiction we have to understand that this form of emotional engagement be new there be people out there who say that we have always have emotionally engaging content via tv radio and newspaper but the type that happen on these platform be genuinely new because it be addictive by design once upon time the bright mind in the world all want to work in law and medicine now many of they be work for big tech company try to work out the circuitry of our brain to keep we addicted to their platform they do that because we do not pay for those platform but we do pay for they with our attention the more we look at their platform the more ad revenue they generate that be new and we need new regulation to address it the second interrelated element of addiction be the way it interact with algorithm we funnel people down echo chamber and reduce their exposure to the other person view ultimately that damage critical analysis and lead to the kind of polarisation that believe we be see in our politic today with unregulated content full of misinformation be supply to people incessantly as we remain addicted to our device and stick in bubble we think to ourselves just imagine how dangerous this could be if the technology get into the wrong hand but of course it already have as liberal be always sceptical of concentration of power because we know how vulnerable it leave society we have somehow allow big tech to make the argument to we and to government across the world that its oligopolistic power over this industry be justify natural order somehow and something we should make an exception for in our global economy in do so we have allow handful of firm to dominate the digital world they control huge amount of our personal datum and now they control our discourse too as have be mention the vast majority of to year old use social medium as their primary news source as each generation pass the role of tv newspaper and radio will only continue to diminish be at career fair at local school the other day and young kid come up to he must have be about year old almost immediately he start talk to about donald trump in positive way when ask he where he be hear all this stuff he of course answer tiktok his mate all giggle because they be all do exactly the same thing do not think we be treat this with the seriousness that we need to will make just one more remark about the media environment lot of the more clickbaity outlet generate their revenue not by the quality of their content but by how many people they manage to get on to their website that be how they get ad revenue many of the more consider and perhaps critical publication be often behind paywall this situation be drive lot of our public conversation at the moment because of what medium be available to people for free if most people be get their news from these digital platform we be leave at the whim of those in charge of those platform those people not only have control of their platform to manipulate our discourse but have huge amount of personal wealth and can sadly interfere with politic in way that people have always be able to through donation and the influence of their personal wealth this be double edged sword for we as we have see this kind of wealth and influence have have real world impact most recently we have see elon musk role in the us election if we think back bit far there be kind of intransigence from facebook over the dark ad that run during the brexit campaign when nobody know who be responsible for run those campaign for some time as be explain early the organise pile ons and everyday disruption attempt to silence politician in their contribution to everyday debate over the past few year it feel like we be start to make some progress in society on this topic we have the formulation and introduction of the online safety act and it feel like great effort be be make to check the power of social medium giant however right now it feel like we be about to go backwards again in reaction to the election of president trump we see meta roll back its moderation capability in the uk legislation such as the online safety act and the digital services act some of the few tool we have in our toolbox to tackle these social medium giant be up for discussion as part of wide trade negotiation with the us we must fight hard to keep those tool in our toolbox and keep those protection but we be kid ourselves if we think those alone will be enough free press be fundamental pillar of liberal democracy and these digital platform be threaten it as well as protect the legislation we already have this house need to start talk about what further action we can take without it all our place be under threat thank the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood for bring this debate to the chamber throughout history from the print press to social medium technological advancement have often outpace the law mean to regulate they today digital platform evolve at speed that outstrip government ability to fully understand or regulate their impact especially concern for democracy which depend on informed citizen make choice shape by debate yet democracy be increasingly undermine by bad faith actor misinformation and manipulation as digital native and future voter young people face particular risk and government owe they duty of care to help they to develop in an informed and safe way online however old citizen with less experience of social medium and new tech platform can also face difficulty in how they interact and interpret information or disinformation in addition to the risk of early form of digital platform for democracy such as the spread of misinformation contemporary digital platform now possess novel risk such as deepfake ai bot and form video content will focus my speech on how this situation relate to our democratic engagement in scotland year old have the right to vote in local and national election with the government manifesto promise vote at in uk election it be important to consider the impact of digital platform on young voter and the young generation who will one day become voter it will not surprise many to hear that young people be extensive user of digital platform and that their online habit be evolve rapidly accord to ofcom of to year old use social medium and even among child as young as to third be now active online platform such as tiktok and discord be increasingly shape young people understanding of the world include politic ofcom report that child age to be now spend an average of five hour and minute day engage in social medium activity it be right to note that there be benefit to the use of digital platform by young people in our political system these platform allow young people access to the entire sum of human knowledge and therefore have real scope as great source of education and knowledge they can not only provide helpful information and analysis on our politic but act as new mean of get young people engage and interested in our democratic system despite these benefit it remain the case that there be real risk and harm associate with child use of social medium and their outlook on democracy recent tv show such as adolescence have highlight that digital platform can act as echo chamber where extremist community can influence young people idea and opinion recent survey publish by the university of glasgow john smith centre base in my constituency find that nationally of to year old would prefer to live in democracy that say of those survey would prefer to live in dictatorship the fact that more than quarter of this age group would prefer to live in system completely juxtapose to our own democracy should be warning to we all in difficult time globally with uncertainty and disruption to previously accept pattern of international national and local environment the lure of simplistic but dangerous solution promote by bad faith actor can be all too persistent welcome the action take to address these challenge by commit both to make the digital world safe place for young people and to deliver real tangible improvement in their life through other policy initiative but we must work hard as we move forward to respond to the ever change environment of online activity that we face social medium giant must be hold accountable for the role their platform play in shape public discourse and no tech executive should be above the law commend the effort of the hon member for lagan valley in secure this backbench business debate and introduce it today we must not only protect young people and in fact all citizen from harm online but equip they with the tool to shape their future assume they be not just passive consumer of digital content but informed and engage citizen in our democracy commend the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood first for secure this debate and give we all an opportunity to participate and secondly for her passion for the subject matter be pleased to be here to represent my constituency the two of we be represent the entirety of northern ireland here and commend she for her courage her speech and her determination to be sperson for many the rise of digital platform and their use have be of concern for many year recently more than ever be probably the old person in this chamber and we be talk about issue that never face in my youth but my child face they and my grandchild will information be distribute online so readily and it be easily access by anyone whatever their age the spread of false damaging and vile information shape how the public form their opinion and there be so much work to be do on this matter the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood refer to that in her introduction in survey just last week member of the legislative assembly in northern ireland both male and female be ask whether they have be subject to high level of abuse some say that if they have know that the abuse would be so bad they would never have enter politic if that do not tell we about the amount of abuse and vile comment target at both man and woman nothing do have recently see numerous disgusting comment on social medium about many politician include and other in my party they be write by keyboard warrior hero who hide behind their keyboard of all age and background in the past week have have nothing but admiration for my hon friend the member for upper bann carla lockhart she have be an inspiration not only to member but to young woman across the united kingdom who have face personal online abuse she have be so courageous watch she and naomi long the minister of justice in the northern ireland assembly on the view last thursday night when get home both of they be excellent they epitomise the sort of people who be at the receiving end of vile abuse family have to read abuse about love one there must be zero place in society for that abuse hope the minister will acknowledge how much work there be to be do on this matter we have see the rise of social medium over the past to year and its impact on child as grandfather of six very much understand why we must protect our child look to the minister who be mother to reassure we on this matter know that she appreciate how big an impact social medium have on our child and grandchild although social medium have obvious benefit it teach digital skill and give we the ability to communicate which be good thing the mental health issue that flow from it be shocking anxiety and depression be at an all time high among child when see the stat for northern ireland have to question they be sure the figure be similar for the united kingdom child as young as eight nine and be suffer from anxiety issue and depression we see more suicide and thousand of instance of cyber bullying hear the hon member for lagan valley comment on the new netflix show adolescence the traction it have gain be incredible and she should be commend there be lesson to be learn on mental health the danger of social medium and friendship and relationship perhaps there could be more onus on our school to deliver such material when the minister respond perhaps she can tell we what discussion she have have with education ministers to ensure that the issue be directly address at school agree with what the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew say about mobile phone be convinced that the issue have to be address directly know that school in northern ireland be run pilot scheme in which phone be remove from the child and put in pouch and then return at the end of the day if our education minister paul givan can see that this have to be do then with the great of respect it should be do here as well as an elect representative can say that yes it be important to have an online presence to engage with local business and constituent but have very limited engagement with social medium that may be because it be generational matter or because have see the devastation that social medium can cause there be no secret about the misinformation that be out there be probably fortunate that have limit social medium contact and that understand the danger of it freedom of speech be important but there be difference between healthy debate and disagreement on the one hand and the vile and unnecessary comment that we see on social medium on the other in this house have always try to engage with everyone in suitable way and to be friendly and respectful of other who have different opinion have speak in debate in the chamber numerous time include in debate on the online safety bill about the need for great regulation of social medium there be responsibility on the government in conjunction with social medium company to ensure that people be safe especially our youth adult should know well but unfortunately that be not always the case young people be impressionable and be inclined to go with crowd not only that but they be grow up in world where social medium be massive so the correct provision need to be in place and look to the minister for response on these matter know that will not be disappoint in she because she understand the issue she face the same issue with her family to conclude there be huge amount of work to be do there be responsibility on we personally on teacher on social medium company and on parent to ensure that online safety be accord the utmost priority address this matter be not simply down to the parent this be joint effort and we must work hard together to resolve the issue look forward to work closely with colleague from all part of this chamber on this matter because we all have the same connection and the same goal hope the minister will commit to work with her counterpart in the devolved nation to ensure that we can apply the same strategy everywhere thank the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood for secure this debate know how important this matter be to she and to all of we we be all representative of our democracy and it be crucial that we as government address the concern about the impact of digital platform on our democratic process sadly faith in our democracy be be wither away in today age of misinformation and disinformation even more concern be the rise of threat and abuse receive online by mp across this house the abuse take unique form for female mp and for mps of colour who be too often the target of sexist or racist threat of violence be not sure whether declaration be necessary in this case but would like to make it know that be member of the speaker conference on the security of candidate mp and election and commend mr speaker for his work in this space the anonymity grant to user by online platform make perpetrator feel especially confident in their abuse it also make it hard to track and identify the bad offender additionally with the rise of artificial intelligence bot can be direct to abuse mps and political candidate en masse these bot be even more difficult to trace direct abuse and threat at mps be not only hateful it deliberately undermine our political system asthe hon member for lagan valley say this be about threat against this house when we must fear for our safety the most valuable link in our democracy that between we and our constituent be strained an mp should feel safe in their own community as should anyone else threat and abuse be not the only issue online platform be privy to horde of personal sensitive information about their user for many people social media be their main source of news around of my constituent in stafford eccleshall and the village use facebook but we know that facebook have troubling history of endanger democracy we all remember the outrage when facebook breach the personal information of million of user share it with the political consulting firm cambridge analytica this datum be then use to target political advertisement in the us presidential campaign of the breach be not discover until two year later for this be the first time that realise just how seriously the political process could be undermine by digital platform very recently meta state that it would no long use independent fact checker as result misinformation run even more rampant be sure that we have all experience family member send we post that present themselves as fact but be often complete nonsense sadly since become an mp these have be really target at so my family and friend will send picture of at the back of room look shadowy member will be pleased to know that apparently recently ban banter allow misinformation to run rife lead directly to loss of faith in our democratic institution and to rise in extremism to reiterate the point make about look shadowy in the corner it be problem for all political party when individual be personally target particularly woman and people of colour as those group face specific attack it be obvious that social medium have the capacity to influence election and that it can be medium for abuse and threat know that many friend from across the chamber will have experience this at first hand it be therefore crucial that action be take to curb abuse and misinformation my hon friend be make compelling case about the risk associate with social medium platform company too often seem to have all the agency and none of the accountability for what we see on their platform we see these platform push more and more extreme content to people through their algorithm do my hon friend agree that it be time we see check and balance apply to the social medium giant my hon friend remind of something my sister in law recently tell she see story on instagram about girl experience in relationship my brother receive completely separate version of the story it be target by gender there be disparity in the narrative be push my sister in law mention how weird it be that they both get the story on the same day but with different narrative be push my hon friend be give an excellent emotional speech its excellence be her trademark highlight this problem and be sorry to hear about the issue she have face do she agree that when members of parliament be target in this way it affect not only they but their family as the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood say that put people off get involve in politic which can not be good thing for democracy thank my hon friend for his point and completely agree be particularly passionate about get more woman into politic it be something will constantly bang on about number of woman have say to do want to put myself in that position in fact when be consider stand for this place it be one of the thing be most nervous about be not huge user of social medium platform and have never really put my life out there in that way so be incredibly nervous about stand for political role because do not want to expose myself or my family in that way my hon friend make very valid point in the old day we have coffee shop and pub in which to disagree over politic but the rise of social medium have mean that today people often get their information online and have political conversation online quiet conversation in pub or coffee shop do not reach thousand of people within second social medium have mean that the very nature of political discourse have change because the medium have change apologise for not be here in the early part of the debate madam deputy speaker be so move by what the hon lady say the truth be that the discourse she describe have be brutalise complex idea have be make simple or at least apparently simple and malignance have be give licence exactly as she say my advice to any new member of this house be do not get involve be not involve in social medium at all but have an immense profile in my constituency because occupy the real world not the virtual world real world contact with people be always more value and more valuable agree with the right hon member host lot of community coffee morning in my constituency in which we discuss complex idea rather than three word solution to very complex problem social media be here to stay the next thing we do must be to regulate it appropriately it be our duty as member of this house to ensure that our constituent still have an avenue through which to share their opinion agree with the hon member for lagan valley about disagree with people it be an incredibly important feature of our democracy but we must enforce guideline that protect user from harmful content misinformation and abuse ultimately we must restore faith in our political process by improve the discourse we can improve our democracy look forward to hear the minister outline the government plan to tackle this issue rise order be impose an immediate five minute limit call manuela perteghella start by congratulate the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood on introduce this timely and urgent debate as we know the digital age have bring about an unprecedented opportunity for campaign of any kind include campaign of nefarious origin and by malign agent who seek to undermine democracy and the safety of our people digital platform be proliferate at rapid pace and reach an unprecedented number of british citizen they have become the most powerful communication tool of our age and be able to absorb vast amount of detailed personal information about their user far the platform can apply complex algorithm to create tailor make campaign and personally target advertisement and content that can include spread conspiracy theory extreme content and abuse towards citizen and elect official regrettably successive government have not be proactive in tackle the threat they have be complacent with inertia and inaction while tech and social medium giant have spread misinformation and outright lie they have let their digital platform incite hatred and digital and physical violence and they have cause riot on our street the digital world be the last frontier wide open for exploitation by domestic and foreign power who do not have britain good interest at heart the russian government have be accuse of orchestrate widespread campaign of interference and disinformation that seek to undermine the global order last autumn the head of warn that the international order be under threat in way not see since the end of the cold war accuse russia of reckless campaign of sabotage across europe likewise elon musk recently use his platform to suggest that america should liberate the people of britain and overthrow the uk government as we have hear it be not just our democratic process that be under threat and be target but our child too with violent misogyny online abuse radicalisation and sexualisation on these platform who be keep our child safe the online safety act must not be water down in any future trade deal negotiation with the us far the spread of misinformation online have the power to dramatically alter the outcome of our election and referendum and in do so change the course of this country who will take responsibility for the regulation of digital political campaign the electoral commission say that its focus be on campaign finance the information commissioner office say that its focus be on personal datum and the advertising standards authority say that it do not regulate political advert when we do not regulate to protect our democracy and our child and young people we rely on company to regulate themselves we hope that facebook three part strategy to target misinformation be robust enough that google centre for content responsibility take its job seriously and that the eu fine levy against tech company for spread disinformation have any real impact unfortunately our hope will be in vain in these unsettling time of global challenge we must take the protection of britain and its people into our own hand we can not rely on our safety be priority for any other nation or for unelected tech billionaire we need regulation and legislation to protect the people of britain and ensure that our democracy be not affect by lie propagate by group and individual who do not have britain good interest at heart effective tech regulation for digital platform would result in radical real time transparency for political advertising for example on donation and spending it should result in strong law on digital safeguarding especially for young people and child as america influence by its tech billionaire withdraw from its role as the protector of the free world let britain step up to the mark and become global leader in digital transparency regulation and safeguarding it be an honour to contribute to this debate on such critical issue as the former head of policy for the british computer society this be one of my passion project pay tribute to the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood for bravely bring this debate to the house as it affect we all as mps we have duty not only to preserve democracy but to strengthen it we must safeguard the integrity of public discourse yet increasingly the conversation be manipulate by handful of powerful billionaire unaccountable corporate giant and malicious actor foreign and domestic all count on we to dither and retreat from the scale of the challenge public trust in digital platform be erode as the people behind the algorithm that drive the platform wield unprecedented power and influence over million without any of the check and balance by which the rest of our democratic institution have be shape for generation the people behind algorithm that be design to manipulate or exploit be reward sensationalism and division over truth nuance and meaningful discussion and do so with impunity the very distinction between fact and fiction be be erode and fear that young people consciousness of that be be so damaged that we will be unable to navigate the journey to truth that the hon gentleman describe it be about the great internet giant but it be also about the keyboard warrior umberto eco describe the internet as the empire of imbecile the trouble now be that people can not tell the difference between imbecile and expert there be rightly lot of conversation about child in this space but we often forget that people generally be have huge problem just last weekend be knock on door and grow man be say they do not believe anything they read online they do not believe anything say there be no justification it be real difficulty so absolutely take the right hon gentleman point it be important to talk about the people behind the algorithm it be not only important to make the distinction between fact and fiction do my hon friend accept the distinction between the real and fake people who operate in some of these space yes absolutely my hon friend the member for stafford leigh ingham mention the difficulty of identify or hold to account the bot and the non people actor who be cause so many problem in debate such as this talk about the people behind the algorithm and platform because it be far too easy to lose perspective and characterise algorithm and digital platform as something intangible and alien to we when we be actually in control of they in the former member for uxbridge when he be prime minister claim that mutant algorithm be to blame for the exam fiasco it be masterclass in deflect blame from the egregious human failure and from the line of responsibility that track right back to the heart of his government the consequence still impact the thousand of young people my constituent include whose life plan and chance be upend by the hubris of government who be enthral by the promise of tech as quick fix sensationalist headline about mutant algorithm serve no one other than those avoid the finger of blame and it all come at the expense of meaningful space to discuss the issue that truly matter to our constituent such as the cost of living the housing crisis and the need for well public service we must do well online disinformation be persistent and pernicious threat to our democracy false narrative spread much fast and they stick much hard than the truth populist snake oil salesman hawk false hope online and pervert public perception they sell simple solution to complex problem to desperate people they intentionally undermine our institution to their own end do my hon friend agree that many of the people who operate in the background do so on the behalf of our foreign adversary country like russia and iran who outsource this sort of work to sow division inside our society we should work with the government as hard as we can to tackle that thank my hon friend for his intervention will get on to that disinformation have become stealth weapon wield by hostile state and domestic actor alike to destabilise community and society and to undermine democratic norm we see the real world consequence of that just last summer when inflammatory content spread online with impunity fuel riot and civil unrest that serve as stark warning that disinformation do not remain online but have dangerous real life consequence in my constituency see how people manipulate fear in our most vulnerable community use online platform to promote their own craven political agenda will never forgive they for that do my hon friend agree that there be responsibility on all of we who be fortunate enough to be in this place to use our voice proportionately carefully and with respect because by use such platform we have the power to inflame and antagonise which can make situation bad as my hon friend know be very moderate human being agree with she one of the thing that want to do in this place and in my constituency be always look for the positive angle in thing to talk with moderation and to calm community tension rather than inflame they for political gain see much more of the former at the moment and be grateful for that strong regulation great transparency and real accountability be essential but so be meaningful and applicable education and training one will not be fully effective without the other platform must act in the public interest and have great ethical oversight and governance rather than simply follow the corporate interest of shareholder the voice of ordinary citizen not the interest of the few must shape our national discourse and the uk have to push for global consensus where it can in an increasingly challenging and complex world my hon friend be make an incredibly impassione speech which come from place of real experience as have be mention though we see an incredibly stark divide in the young generation recent research on generation have show that it be more polarised than ever with over of young people prefer authoritarianism do he agree that it be time to ensure that our young people can access nuanced debate absolutely we need to create space in our school and our community for that debate be really encourage by the work of my colleague in government include my hon friend the minister who be take their responsibility to the british public seriously and show an openness to engagement that be sorely lack under the previous administration in policy around technology look forward to work with my colleague to take the necessary step to protect and strengthen our democracy in this digital age the government have moral duty to act in the public interest on this let we work together to restore faith in our democracy and our institution and show that we be still the master of our own destiny even in this brave new digital world rise order be now impose an immediate three minute time limit thank the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood for bring this important debate to the chamber and for her courage as we have hear the netflix show adolescence have be wake up call for many about social medium dangerous impact on our world view and belief young boy groom online by an incel culture that be hostile to woman murder female classmate for resist his prejudice against woman campaigner have recently warn of this issue month before adolescence be release zero tolerance many good men report highlight the need to well regulate platform that spread misinformation and radicalisation that be of particular importance for young people include those in my constituency of mid dunbartonshire as nearly of they rely on social medium as their primary information source include for news as we have hear if radical content already fuel violence against woman and girl we must be aware of its effect on democracy the hon member for glasgow north martin rhodes reference research at glasgow university recent work by king college london show that over half of generation think that the uk would improve under strong leader who be unconstraine by parliament or election more worryingly when explicitly ask if they would prefer dictatorship say yes yet when question on that stance they clarify that they simply want leader who could effect change quickly as current progress be too slow this should not come as surprise after all they be bear the brunt of mental health crisis soar house price and brutal job market it be clear that poor online environment reflect poor real world environment individual of all age frustrate by their circumstance look for something to blame be it woman immigration or democracy in sentiment drive by social medium giant and the far right populist who exploit young people frustration the solution to social medium erosion of democracy lie in the real world the john smith centre stress that politician should be more open and transparent and address young people housing and employment concern to reduce disillusionment if we ignore their challenge social medium will continue to undermine our democracy and draw our young people into increasingly extreme environment be grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate and thank the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood for raise this important issue it be all too tempting to believe that democratic process be once strong more resilient or perhaps more civil but do not think nostalgia be particularly practical strategy nor however can we assume that progress towards well world be natural and without setback it be our responsibility as legislator not simply to comment on history but actively to shape it particularly when we be confront with new and complex challenge the impact of digital platform on our democracy represent precisely such challenge they promise to democratise the debate and give every citizen an equal voice but the reality have be far more complicated and would argue more destabilising than democratising polling by more in common have reveal that of britons believe that social medium negatively impact young people and even more people show strong appetite for great accountability from tech company particularly regard misinformation and online harm ofcom late finding show that three in child age eight to encounter harm online in the last month that be not abstract just because it be online do not mean it be not real harm we do not allow it offline so we should not allow it online social medium company have enormous power to influence the public debate their platform have too often facilitate harmful content hate speech misinformation and abuse and the reality be that they continue to profit from division and outrage we should expect lot well from such influential business chair the all party parliamentary group against antisemitism so be subject to particular kind of abuse that give the tiny glimpse into what it be like to be either jewish or indeed any minority in the uk just ignore most of it because it be so widespread but occasionally will get something and think that be really not acceptable and will report it there have be lot of comment in the debate about the impact on members family my hon friend be talk about her experience of abuse in her role as an appg chair do she agree that her staff be also expose to that absolutely agree want to give member sense of what have report to which have be tell do not meet its threshold for action and can just block the account if want to here be some of the comment be direct at why be jews allow to invest in politician in the uk be you jewish most jewish child be weak and neurotic and struggle to understand thing the way advance aryan child do you be not well breed you be taint of jewish blood this soften the heart and darken the soul in relation to the holocaust have be tell it do happen mate that do reach harmful content threshold and be allow to continue these people operate with impunity in this country transparency in the algorithms proactive content moderation and genuine co operation with regulator such as ofcom should absolutely not be optional tech company must understand that access our market and citizen carry clear responsibility and that if they want to operate here they need to obey the law of our land this be not about stifle innovation or freedom it be about order call noah law the strength of our democracy lie in its people their voice concern and participation the labour party that know have always be party of the grassroot particularly in cornwall and of real individual engage with real community we be not the party of faceless bot anonymous profile or foreign interference yet as we reflect on last year general election we must confront the unsettling reality that the integrity of our democratic process be under threat from hostile actor and unaccountable digital platform such as those we have hear about today in my constituency have see the manipulation at first hand the administrator of the local reform uk facebook group supposedly represent my constituency be not local at all not single one that can see have anything to do with my constituency many can not even be identify as real individual this be not grassroots activism it be astroturfe an insidious form of political manipulation where orchestrated campaign masquerade as spontaneous grassroots movement mislead and deceive the public that be not an isolated case across the uk our election be taint by misinformation on an unprecedented scale these be not spontaneous expression of democratic electorate but the work of malign domestic and foreign actor deliberately interfere to distort the public discourse the power of those platform to spread falsehood rapidly and without scrutiny undermine trust in our political system undoubtedly the owner of the platform wield immense influence on our public discourse their decision on content moderation as we have hear shape what information be disseminate and trust the fact that one such owner have openly endorse figure convict of hate crime such as stephen yaxley lennon be appal signal how those with immense digital influence can amplify those voice these be not neutral platform but ideological battleground and right now the scale be tip in favour of disinformation labour stand for different vision of politic politic build on real people engagement and community call the liberal democrat spokesperson serious allegation be make recently that liberal democrats spend too much time in our community fix church roof and be not on twitter well last night log back on and let tell the house that twitter be absolutely brilliant the quality and depth of political debate really be something to behold liberal and authoritarian nationalist and internationalist and people from the economic right left and centre be engage in well inform expansive and thoughtful debate about the most pressing issue of the day jest of course it be total waste of time for everybody involve include elon musk have make twitter useful for some people though refer to those on the hard right of politic who be profit by sow the seed of division they be not just profit politically but line their pocket with the money of social medium baron madam deputy speaker have already tell the member to whom be about to refer that intend to refer to he today because his entry in the register of members financial interests be reveal the leader of reform the member for clacton nigel farage have declare more than in earning from one particular source since he be elect the address of the payer be in market square know what member be all think it the charming cover market in clacton no that close in it be elon musk base in market square in san francisco california he have also declare more than in earning from google from cameo base in chicago and more than from meta in california one wonder where the member for clacton find the time as intake mp encounter colleague who basically do not have time to go to the loo on more philosophical note for someone who claim to be patriot he be certainly take lot of money from international source that should give we all pause for thought when we consider the impact of digital platform on democracy we might conclude at the very least that it distract some mps from do their actual job and do not mean the distraction of doom scrolling mean the distraction of the grift what of the broad threat present by social medium platform we have speak on many occasion recently about the issue that young man face and the impact on democracy it be my belief that at heart those issue be the symptom of many problem include the tone of debate about the role and responsibility of boy as they become man lack of route to secure employment and ludicrously high housing and rental price for someone who be stick in their childhood bedroom look for reason why their life be rubbish the digital world have no shortage of scapegoat woman minority people immigrant foreigner refugee disabled people the weak single parent family the list go on there be also no shortage of snake oil

the ocean be pretty sure that be not true the lad should not worry about it but so many do thank to these snake oil seller online thank to president trump and those who argue for bizarre form of freedom of speech just not for everyone the truth be now contested concept and it be intertwine with fear and hatred which be both threat to our democracy we all know where the truth go to die whichever social media platform you like you just start post outlandish stuff you keep go you double down you find mad and hateful narrative you tell everyone it be free speech and before you know it you might be lucky enough to become successful online grifter with your top off perhaps you will be an mp or maybe even the president of america two day ago it be april fool day hate april fool day because the world be now so ludicrous that we do not know what be joke and what be not even bad what we post as joke might end up be share so many time that it become somebody else truth eventually in the bad case that become part of hate fuel conspiracy theory will not mention it everyone here know what it be there be many increasingly popular conspiracy theory online that have nothing to do with hatred but be plainly bizarre will not name they here for the sake of all our inboxe but every single one of those outlandish claim be threat to our democracy and those view be go round the world quick and quick thank to social medium what should we in this place be do about it while digital and social medium platform can be good for democracy they be inherently vulnerable to misinformation and abuse and they reduce the quality of public debate we need look no far than the riot follow the tragic southport attack that tragedy for those little girl and their family be compound for so many by what happen in the follow day when people be whip up into frenzy by false rumour lead to more violence musk zuckerberg meta and other social medium company facilitate that spread of misinformation and they have make it entirely clear to all of we that they do not care let we face it platform such as tiktok and snapchat be make our child sad and depressed they be put check on the development of the adult of the future and they absolutely can not be trust musk use his purchase of twitter to far leverage his influence over the world large democracy he change the rule to boost his own post and push aside those he disagree with freedom of speech but for some more than other from his own platform the world rich man have make several direct interruption in our democracy last summer he seek to far incite disorder post that in the uk civil war be inevitable he also call for america to liberate the people of britain and overthrow the uk government and he have suggest he might bankroll the reform party while have some sympathy for ministers deal with trump do they really think it be wise to be so gentle with he when his right hand man musk have call for they to be forcibly eject from office realise that minister be limit in what they can say but be pretty sure know what they think regardless of diplomatic norm this be plainly absurd bad than that it make our once strong nation look weak what should we do social medium company must take large role in tackle misinformation it be clear that they will not do it without government intervention and they need to get on with it liberal democrats believe that strict regulation must be introduce to ensure that they properly challenge the spread of misinformation on their platform we must stand up to they we must intervene to protect our democracy as liberal believe that unchecked power and wealth be inherently dangerous and often take my whip from john stuart mill who warn the dictum that truth always triumph over persecution be one of those pleasant falsehood which all experience refute we must heed that warning call the opposition spokesperson thank the backbench business committee and the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood for secure this important debate digital platform can both enhance and undermine democracy social medium can increase awareness of election and candidate encourage participation and voter turnout but it can also lead to the abuse of democratically elect mp councillor and politician even more worrying be the threat of electoral interference from malign international actor be grateful to member from all party who take part in what be an incredibly thoughtful and interesting debate on such an important issue for reason of time can not reflect on everyone speech but wish to pay particular heed to three member who have speak thank the hon member for lagan valley for her incredibly powerful speech and be sorry about the abuse attack and threat she have experience any attack or abuse to an mp be an attack on our democracy we have brilliant representative in this place be proud to be member of this the great parliament in the world and there be duty on we to stand up for our fellow colleague member across the house and elect representative at all level particularly thank she for mention jo cox and david amess be elect after jo cox be murder but do get to meet david amess before he be murder and still have letter that he send when be elect as new mp know that he and jo cox be very much miss by we all sadly what happen to they clearly drive home the importance of ensure that we deal with these problem and get this right later in my speech will pick up on one of the point that the hon member for lagan valley raise about disinformation and misinformation as well as digital watermarking she also raise important point about how social medium operate have often think that we need to think about anonymity and privacy separately in term of people use platform and its content pay tribute to the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds who use her speech in part to make some comment regard her resignation principle be not principle unless we act on they and hope she have the opportunity to serve in his majesty government again at some point in the future there have be so many brilliant speech and would like to reference everybody but can not due to time however some remark by the hon member for east kilbride and strathaven joani reid jump out at particularly the quote that she read out in this chamber and those vile comment would be grateful if the minister comment on that when she wind up the debate and say what reassurance she can give the house that the issue be be deal with appropriately by the digital online platform protect the integrity of our election and stop the influence of malign and foreign actor be critical role for the government and it be the government responsibility to work closely with the electoral commission and other to protect the integrity security and effectiveness of uk referendum and election the electoral commission have wide range of investigatory and civil sanction power and the government be able to refer more serious matter to the police or the national crime agency as outline in the previous government response to the report on russia by the intelligence and security committee the uk adversary adapt whole of state approach to hybrid and malign activity therefore tackle it require cross government cross society response to respond effectively the government need to draw on the skill resource and remit of different departments agency and non governmental organisation consider the current geopolitical landscape it be essential that the government keep all aspect of their approach to protect democracy under review so that they can quickly adapt to any new threat that emerge the uk be not alone in face this issue democracy across the western world be face the same issue political party be successfully harness the impact of social medium to reach cohort of voter who be normally uninterested or disillusioned that be good thing but country be face interference from other state include russia and china so how should government respond the previous government be resolute in defend our country from hostile state activity the elections act which they bring forward restrict third party campaigning to uk base group and eligible overseas elector so that only those with legitimate interest in uk election can campaign at uk election it also contain new measure require digital imprint on online campaign material and great transparency in political funding the previous government also pass the world lead online safety act to which many member have refer its provision have only recently come into force and hope this government will continue to actively monitor what ofcom be do to ensure the act be work appropriately there be also threat from artificial intelligence and disinformation particularly the ability of ai to create realistic video and image impersonate trust public figure include political and religious leader the risk of that be clear for all to see in committee we table an amendment to the data use and access bill that would have set up technological standard on digital watermark in part it be about help to solve some of the issue around ai and copyright but it be also about ascribe authenticity to what people be put on social medium suspect that like many colleague from across the house would like to have the ability to put digital watermark on the material they put out so that people can be sure that the content they be see be from the person who purport to have create it the government vote our amendment down but hope ministers will work with we to support such measure go forward to conclude we must ensure that regulation be effective and up to date with the late technology we must ensure that the public be make aware of the risk of ai generate content and deliberate misinformation and we must tackle foreign interference in our election digital platform can enhance democracy and it be important that we do not lose sight of that like it or not traditional media be no long the primary news source for many people twitter facebook tiktok and snapchat be all part of the news ecosystem if we as politician want well participation in democracy believe that all of we want that we can not vacate social medium although if be honest be very jealous of the people who do not use it or vacate the online space instead we must ensure that it work for all of we thank the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood for secure the debate join she in honour the memory of our dear colleague sir david amess and jo cox be grateful to she and to all the other speaker for their incredibly powerful and insightful contribution to the debate the government share the hon member concern about the impact that online harassment intimidation abuse misinformation and disinformation have on our democracy exist and emerge technology have lead to change in the information environment and will continue to shape our future but it be and will always be an absolute priority for the uk government to protect our democracy and we remain well prepared to do so with robust system in place be grateful to the hon member for share her experience the house should hear about the online abuse and hate that she have face there be no place for that and thank she for share it the government be commit to combat violence against woman and girl the online safety act require ofcom to develop and enforce guidance for tech company which aim to ensure that platform implement measure to reduce harm to woman and girl online the act impose legal responsibility on online platform include social medium platform gaming platform date app and search engine to protect user from illegal content and material that be harmful to child and to address issue that disproportionately affect woman and girl those measure reflect the government commitment to create safe online environment acknowledge the unique challenge face by woman and girl in the digital space in put that guidance together ofcom consult with the domestic abuse commissioner the victims commissioner and expert in the field the effectiveness of those measure depend on their robust implementation and enforcement which we will monitor closely as the hon member know the implementation of the online safety act start only in spring this year while we know it be landmark act it be not perfect so the government will continue to keep it under review and we will not shy away from strengthen it where require as say the act be already be implement we will introduce protection to protect people from illegal content such as child sexual abuse and terrorist material as well as to protect child from harmful material make it clear to the house and to all member who raise this issue that that be not up for negotiation the hon member also raise the issue of ban smartphone for the government will consider all option in pursuit of child online safety however it be important that the government take evidence base action in recognition of the need to balance safety with allow child to use technology positively be sure she be also aware that in november last year the department announce study use method and datum to understand the impact of smartphone and social medium on child the study begin in december last year and will run for six month until may and be sure we will report to the house on that come back to my right hon friend the member for oxford east anneliese dodds take

tackle content contribute to the disorder which include proactively refer content to platform that assess and act on it in line with their term of service throughout our engagement we have be very clear that social medium platform should not wait for the online safety act to come into action they should actively be remove harmful content my right hon friend also raise the issue of broad international collaboration on online safety with which absolutely agree international collaboration be absolutely crucial in tackle the global threat of online harm and we must build consensus around approach that uphold our democratic value and promote free open and secure internet as the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer say since the elections act have protect candidate campaigner and elect office holder from intimidation both online and in person it be an election offence for person to make or publish before or during an election false statement of fact about candidate personal character or conduct for the purpose of affect the return for that candidate at the election if the person do not believe it to be true this provide reasonable check and balance against malicious smear campaign we also have the defend democracy taskforce which have mandate to drive forward whole government response to the full range of threat to our democracy that taskforce

recommend that all candidate take look there be also an investment of million over financial year to strengthen protective security measure for mp locally elect representative and candidate as report by the electoral commission last year uk general election be deliver safely and securely certain novel risk such as ai generate deepfake influence the outcome do not materialise however in that election there be unacceptable harassment and intimidation direct at candidate particularly female candidate and campaigner especially online it be clearly vital that everyone regardless of their sex gender or race feel able to participate in public life the home office be review this activity through the defend democracy taskforce we need to well understand the trend motivation and driver that cause people to harass and intimidate their elect representative that include identify gap and vulnerability and develop recommendation to strengthen legislative response as well as clear delineation of online versus in person activity and its impact that work will be report to the taskforce and my department have contribute to these effort to tackle online harm and improve online environment

digital platform on uk democracy access to sport pe in schools beg to move that this house have consider access to sport and pe in school first put on record my gratitude to the backbench business committee for grant time for this debate in the chamber call for this debate because make visit to sir graham balfour school in my constituency where meet one of my young constituent tane after my visit he write letter in which he talk in detail about his worry about the impact of on his generation will start by quote he exercise do just chemically make you feel good it great for socialise raise self esteem and cop with losing all life skill that seem bit miss in kid my age since lockdown his statement be profound in its simplicity but it be at the heart of my argument today access to sport and physical education be about more than keep child physically fit it be about give they skill resilience and the confidence to navigate life challenge it be about their mental health their ability to form friendship and their capacity to overcome obstacle it be about ensure that no child be deny the chance to benefit from opportunity because of their background or gender or any other barrier to opportunity that they face in life to begin with want to focus on the clear and undeniable health benefit both physical and mental of sport and exercise sport england active life survey of child and young people provide invaluable insight about physical activity among young people it confirm what many of we fear while overall activity level have remain stable since the long term effect of the pandemic have cast shadow over child engagement with sport their mental wellbeing and their future relationship with physical activity for child who enjoy sport or whose parent can support they in be physically active thing be straightforward but for those child and young people who do not feel comfortable play sport do not have playground to play in or do not have the physical ability to be active easily these thing become much more challenging for many child especially those face socioeconomic challenge or with limited access to recreational facility pe class may be the only opportunity to engage in structured exercise by provide structured and comprehensive pe class school not only contribute to the immediate health of student but equip they with the knowledge and skill to lead active lifestyle into adulthood we know that access to sport do not just benefit physical health as tane say it benefit our mental health too engage in regular exercise release endorphin our feel good hormone that alleviate stress and anger and improve sleep quality mp could probably benefit from that include furthermore participation in team sport or group activity can foster social connection which be instrumental to wellbee and so important in the wake of congratulate my hon friend on secure such an important debate she be kind enough to contribute to my debate about mental health support in education setting she be well aware that the link between mental health and exercise be so important physical exercise can help people manage stress anxiety and depression one in five young people report have mental health disorder or mental health crisis so create and support robust pe curriculum and give child the opportunity to take part in outside sport be more important than ever completely agree will come on to discuss this issue far individual who be inactive be three time as likely to face moderate to severe depression than their active counterpart and we know that regular physical activity can reduce the risk of depression by up to the benefit be even more pronounced when exercise take place outdoors study indicate that immersion in nature enhance happiness impart great sense of life worth and diminish depression and anxiety in change world in which more and more child struggle with their mental health we need to support our young people in any way we can when it come to access sport the significant challenge that young girl face include lack of confidence and fear of judgment particularly around body image they be surround by social medium and edit unrealistic image of woman body which tell they that they need to be perfect to participate this be compound by the fact that many sport be still male dominate be grateful to the hon lady for open today debate my constituent olivia recently write to she and her sister play football for the stockport county and team and they be show clear talent and skill do the hon lady agree that it be really important that we support young girl to get into the habit of play team sport olivia write to because they be look for support with bib and ball which be work on be sure the hon lady agree that get young girl play sport be really important way of get they in the habit of do so for the rest of their life completely agree be about to say little bit about that because equitable access to sport be so important before be elect as an mp work for an organisation call plan international which specialise in work with young people particularly young woman and girl be shocked to learn that on average two third of playground be take up by boy they often play football which mean that the physical space that girl have for play sport be significantly diminish be delighted to learn that four school in my constituency sign up to take part in girl big ever football session sir graham balfour flash ley primary stafford manor high and church eaton primary change start at home so be proud to have school in my patch that prioritise the inclusion of young woman and girl in sport and football however despite the lionesses brilliant euros win many girl still do not feel comfortable playing football in the lionesses bring football home and say that it be only the beginning echo their open letter to the then prime minister in which they ask he to make sure that young girl have access to at least two hour of pe week that physical activity among young woman be track and that there be accountability for ensure that take place the government now have the chance to deliver on the lionesses ask which would benefit girl and young woman around the country from sport england research we know that active child be not only healthy but happy more resilient and more confident however despite the overwhelming evidence support the benefit of physical activity many young people be be leave behind particularly those from disadvantaged background speak to representative of swim england who tell that only of child from the least affluent family can swim metre by the time they leave primary school by comparison of child from wealthy family can perhaps unsurprisingly the impact of on child relationship with physical activity have be profound those who be in nursery or early primary school when the pandemic strike who be now in year to remain significantly less likely than their old peer to have positive attitude towards sport and physical activity worryingly happiness score have also drop among these age group as have their sense of resilience the number of child who keep try when thing get tough be down by for those in year and and down by for those in year and in change world we know how important it be that child be able to keep go when thing get tough and sport be one of the key way that they can learn that resilience as tane say where else can child learn to pick themselves up and go again in prepare for this debate want to ensure that the voice of child with special educational need and disability be at the heart of the discussion walton hall academy in my constituency be special educational need school and it have tell how crucial the role of sport be in support its student by provide an opportunity to develop essential skill include hand eye co ordination and teamwork while foster sense of belong and confidence for many send young people in both mainstream and specialist school sport be not only an activity but powerful vehicle for achieve their education health and care plan target such as promote communication and building connection which be area that can be particularly challenge for send young people however when speak to the activity alliance and paralympicsgb both share some worrying information about inclusivity of sport for send young people nationally of our young people and child have special educational need which be about million people but of they be not active in school mean that over one in of our child nationwide be not active fear that those number be due to poor understanding of inclusion for disabled child furthermore access sport and play outside school can be financially prohibitive for send family with membership fee and specialised equipment present specific barrier have be run campaign in my own constituency for inclusive playpark as place where child can get active for free but that would need to be roll out nationwide that have significant challenge because of the difference when it come to special educational need and disability recently host coffee morning on send in my constituency and many parent tell that their experience with council and school be frequently adversarial and confrontational which can exacerbate this issue no child should be leave on the sideline and know how seriously the department for education take its responsibility to send child strongly encourage the government to consider adapt teacher training and education to ensure that the next generation of the teaching workforce have the skill and confidence necessary to deliver truly inclusive physical education that could involve significant disability inclusion training and introduce subject specific disability inclusion training to the core content framework for pe specialist such as special accessible lesson plan and wide range of adaptive sport do not know if any member have ever play wheelchair basketball but it be actually the most fun and it be incredibly competitive recently play wheelchair basketball with the harrogate hammerheads at the liberal democrat party conference with my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey it be joyful experience and what learn be that it be basically impossible thank the hon member for the intervention agree that it be definitely challenge but what like about it be that it can provide level playing field class of mainstream and send kid can play it together and everyone find it really challenge so it be great leveller move on from send the ongoing curriculum review be rare opportunity to enhance access to pe sport teach teamwork discipline and resilience which be essential quality for both education and employment employer seek individual who can collaborate and persevere and sport provide such training ground diverse pe curriculum include activity beyond traditional sport such as football and rugby no shame they be both great sport can engage more student option such as martial art yoga and dance could be explore to ensure that pe appeal to all however this be not just about access to sport it be about the social value of sport and the fact that it give child and young people more time and energy to focus on other subject and attain well result what other subject give kid focus like pe do by embed structure high quality pe into the school week we would be not only improve child health but give they the tool they need to succeed in other subject and study sport also provide valuable lesson beyond the classroom such as teamwork resilience discipline and leadership again those be essential quality for most career make it clear that perhaps unusually this debate be not to ask for more money for sport at time when our financial situation be so tenuous what we need be more sustainable funding framework for pe and for the pupil premium and school game organiser in school game organiser receive funding promise for each academic year of that parliament that be during process of substantial change under previous government prime ministers and education secretaries but that funding commitment do give school the ability to plan ahead build structured sport programme and invest in the staff and resource necessary to make pe effective however in the year since uncertainty over future funding have leave many school unable to make long term commitment force they into cycle of short term solution that do not serve student or school community well we need assurance that fund for sport and pe will be protect and give the same security as other area of education without that we risk lose dedicated school game organiser and vital school sport programme that have be prove to improve health and wellbeing can the minister please give confirmation that funding for school game organiser will be provide for the next year and consider the possibility of more sustainable long term funding commitment in conclusion we know that sport provide health value in improve physical health we also know that it provide social value in the wellbeing of our child and adult finally we know that it provide an economic value in reduce mental health service usage few gp visit and prevent illness altogether that value be upwards of billion each year sport and pe be not just about fitness they be about the future they be about create society where young people grow up healthy happy and more equipped to navigate life challenge the benefit of sport be not abstract they be real measurable and profoundly impactful if we want healthy nation more resilient workforce and strong society then invest in access to sport and pe be not just policy choice it be necessity urge the government to take the issue seriously to commit to sustainable funding and to ensure that every child regardless of background have the opportunity to thrive through sport we must listen to young people like tane who have articulate so clearly the need for action we must respond with real change as tane say when he write to this seem like quite simple solution to lot of problem congratulate the hon member for stafford leigh ingham on secure the debate could easily spend my whole speech talk about the challenge of increase girl participation in pe and sport in school despite the progress make through initiative such as the this girl can campaign there be still gender gap with only of girl age five to achieve the recommend minute of physical activity each day compare to of boy accord to sport england active life survey in we have come long way since my schoolday in the when girl over eight be not allow to play competitive mixed football and there be no girl team could join have be delighted to see the great stride make in woman football in recent year and it be joy to join girl training session at pucklechurch primary school recently the plus girl run around on very small pitch show that girl really do like football however want to focus today on different area of inequality the participation in pe of child and young people with special educational need and disability be pleased that the hon lady raise this issue in her speech child with send be one and half time more likely to be inactive compare to their peer without send we know the benefit that physical activity can bring improve mental and physical health boost self esteem and important social opportunity for send student so what be the barrier only of pe teacher feel fully confident in adapt activity for child with send accord to research by the youth sport trust there be significant gap in teacher training for inclusive sport school often lack access to the necessary adaptive equipment make it difficult for send student to engage in physical activity on an equal footing with their peer provision be inconsistent with some school able to offer much more well develop programme for send student than other one consequence of that which may surprise some be that it can lead to increase absence for send student the youth sport trust have highlight that pupil with send be more likely to experience disengagement in physical education which can lead to increase school absence report from scope lead disability charity find that child with send who feel exclude from physical activity be at high risk of develop mental health challenge which can far exacerbate absence study by the national autistic society find that student with autism in particular be more likely to be absent from school when pe lesson be not adapt to their need with absence increase by up to for those student to tackle that scope call for more accessible pe facility and training for teacher on how to adapt physical activity for send student it emphasise the importance of inclusive support suggest that school offer broad range of activity that cater to different ability from wheelchair sport to multi sensory activity the national autistic society stress the importance of clear communication structured environment and sensory friendly approach while special olympics great britain highlight that key barrier for child with send be the lack of mainstream sport club that offer inclusive programme urge school and community to create partnership with local club offer pathway to competitive sport for send child and foster an inclusive and welcome environment on that would like to highlight the work of yate acrogymnastics centre contrary to the hon member for stafford do think this will require some funding for adaptive equipment and the specialist training for staff will conclude by highlight the work do by the charity gympanzees which be currently fundraise to open in my constituency the uk first fully accessible exercise play and social centre for disabled child and young people have the privilege of visit its pop up offering before be an mp where see for myself the fantastic holiday activity it provide with an array of specialist equipment and dedicated staff it have have massive impact on its user live whether that be the three year old laughing for the first time the year old

young people who be able to walk for the first time use the specialist equipment open this permanent home for the charity activity will allow it to offer scheme not only in school holiday but year round and would give the centre the scope to open up its facility for other organisation to use include school gympanzee have already raise more than half of its million target to fit out the facility have previously write to ministers ask they to consider contribute to the funding of this centre as pilot facility model that could be roll out across other region to help to inform provision in and provide training for our school ask they to look again at the huge benefit this project could bring for child with complex need and the potential it have to deliver access to pe for child who currently miss out do want to try to get everybody in so we will start with an immediate time limit of four minute thank my hon friend the member for stafford leigh ingham for secure this debate she make some fantastic and profound point in her speech like the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young will focus on disability sport in school across the country three in four disabled child do not take part in pe regularly and four in confide that they would like to take part in more sport if it be offer we should not underestimate the impact this have on these child with disabled child

foundation do genuinely incredible work right across south london include at the national sports centre to support disabled people and other as part of this work the foundation host football session for those with down syndrome and visual impairment as well as powerchair football one of the point that often try to make to people be that of all the protect characteristic define by the equality act disability be by far the most diverse we also talk of specific disability such as autism and cerebral palsy as have spectrum the challenge for disabled sport be really comprehensive but we have expert by experience people with disability who understand how good to bridge that gap and make inclusion possible it be fantastic that the schools minister have recognise this know that she have speak about the need for increased pe in school for disabled child if speak to some of the local school in my constituency be tell that have other facility outside school be absolutely essential it would be remiss of not also to mention kent county cricket club in beckenham which alongside manage two disability team run regular friday night disability cricket session in beckenham for child and young

sport to school across northwich and winsford school sport partnership be an early casualty of the coalition government with the announcement that ringfence funding would be remove in letter to the youth sport trust from the then secretary of state michael gove in october in direct contradiction of what the conservatives have say when in opposition in northwich and winsford the school get

come along to support this worthwhile event shall certainly do my good call josh dean thank my hon friend the member for stafford leigh ingham for secure this debate will say from the outset that sport and pe be not my favourite part of the school week and in prepare for this debate many memory of run in the cold on monday morning come back as be often remind it be not that long ago for be the boy at the back of the class hop that the bell would not ring because desperately do not want to go and do pe member might wonder why have choose to speak in this debate and be sure some of my pe teacher bless to have witness my sporting skill will similarly wonder why one of the many joy of this job be the way it help to see thing in new light even in the community know well where grow up and which call home hertford and stortford have have the privilege of visit almost half of the roughly school in my constituency since be elect and at each one have be amazed at and impress by the quality of their sport and pe provision the positive difference it make for the young people and their success at it to give some example it be great to hear how herts and essex high school girl team recently win silver medal after reach the national hockey final bishop stortford high school pupil luke dunham who be member of herts phoenix athletic club base in ware come third in the race in the inter county cross country championship last month be also privileged to visit new secondary school avanti grange at the end of last year we have touch on the importance of resilience and mindfulness and at that high school see one of its new yoga class have those build into its curriculum and class be way to ensure that their young people be resilient mindful and prepare for the challenge of school and life think that be fantastic when young people find sport that they enjoy at school they will often progress to one of the many fantastic local sport club in our community such as hertford town football club or the bishop stortford community football club to say nothing of our fantastic offering in ware and sawbridgeworth some will go even far like premier league footballer oliver skipp who like go to richard hale school without digress too far from the topic of the debate for young people it do all start at school sport build our young people confidence and be good for their mental health and wellbeing accord to sport england child who be active be happy more resilient and more trusting of other would be grateful if the minister could address two specific point regard the provision of pe and sport in school first give that the final report on the curriculum and assessment be due later this year will she ensure that child mental and physical wellbeing as well as academic achievement be right at the heart of that review additionally in december sport england highlight the impact of the pandemic on young people child age seven to be now less likely to have positive attitude towards activity and they have low sense of opportunity will the minister set out what the department be do to improve and foster positive attitude towards physical activity and exercise among young people mention at the start the many memory have of not enjoy sport or pe at school but it have be privilege to see the amazing provision in my local community and to know the confidence it be build in our young people and how good it be for their mental health and wellbeing want to say huge well do not only to the young people represent our school and community in competition across the country but to all the young people who just want to give sport go and improve their physical and mental wellbeing and enjoy it too thank my hon friend and almost constituency neighbour the member for stafford leigh ingham for secure this debate on such an important topic when we talk about access to sport and physical education in school it be about not just fitness and physical activity but opportunity it be about make sure that every student no matter what their background have the chance to find something in which they can excel or at the very least that they be give the chance to try wish to share personal story when be in school the sport we be offer be restrictive to put it politely or archaic to be bit less generous in autumn and winter it be football for the boy and netball for the girl in summer it be football and cricket for the boy and rounder for the girl sadly although enjoy watch both football and cricket be never my strong suit and yes be always the last one pick for any team as the bottom of the barrel be scrap because of this never feel that sport be something that could excel in or even enjoy however around the time reach year have the opportunity to try sport such as badminton and volleyball sport that suit that be reasonably good at and most importantly that actually enjoy and want to carry on after leave school the lesson take away from that be that sport and pe be not one size fit all there be so many different sport each with their own appeal and it be crucial that child and young people have the chance to explore as wide range as possible accord to youth sport trust report last year of girl in the uk say that they would like to have more option to choose from many girl be not engage in historically male dominate sport such as football and rugby to address this we need two thing first we need improve access to the alternative sport that girl be miss out on to give they the chance to discover something they enjoy and excel in as do secondly we need to break down the outdated gender taboo around sport the lionesses the red roses and campaign such as this girl can be smash those taboo hope that will radiate through our school so we do not leave such huge proportion of student behind in my constituency last month norton canes primary academy and jerome primary school in norton canes and the john bamford primary school and chancel primary school in rugeley all take part in the big ever football session organise by the fa to empower girl to feel like they belong in football as my hon friend the member for stafford say it be great to hear about such initiative to make sure that girl around the country have the opportunity to participate accord to another youth sport trust report child from poor background be the least confident in be active only of to year old in the and socioeconomic group rate themselves as confident about take part in physical activity compare with for high socioeconomic group the statistic show how important fairness and equality of access be the government be absolutely take the right step particularly with last month announcement of million to revamp local sport facility across the uk break down barrier to opportunity and give young people the opportunity to build vital skill and connection my final point be about the importance of sport and pe for young people mental health because of my uselessness at football and cricket often find pe lesson an isolate experience which contribute to the poor mental health that experience at time grow up the macho culture around football in particular be really hard for young gay person in school but believe that culture be start to shift happily have since find hugely positive mental health benefit in sport to make sure that child and young people in school can reap the benefit hope that the recruitment and retention of teacher will be make more stable and that through partnership with school local authority academy trust and the government we can make sure that as many pe teacher as possible be mental health first aider and champion they have such pivotal role to play which perhaps we should value more than we currently do be so grateful to my hon friend the member for stafford for secure this debate because investment in sport be investment in something that will give child the confidence and mental resilience that they need to succeed both on and off the play field pay tribute to my hon friend the member for stafford leigh ingham for secure this important debate which be inspire by one of her constituent by lead the debate my hon friend have show that she put the people of stafford eccleshall and the village at the heart of everything she do in do so she be build back trust in our democracy and democratic institution step by step commend she for that it be also privilege to speak while have two of my favourite constituent aishah and samir up in the public gallery thank they for come wish to offer some personal reflection and will probably echo some of the comment make by my hon friend the member for cannock chase josh newbury as someone who live under the long dark damaging shadow of margaret thatcher hat section in the school and particularly pe be often violent and miserable place for gay kid like who could not fit in no matter how much try or how much pretend not to be who be thankfully because of the new labour government commitment to break down barrier to opportunity their repeal of section and the many other legislative and social change that be deliver education and sport in school be now far more inclusive sport teach teamwork resilience and discipline exclude less build friendship and give child the chance to push themselves and crucially have fun it be one of the simple and most effective tool we have to improve both physical and mental health yet while so much progress have be make to make sport inclusive access to pe and sport in school be far from what it should be over the past year we have see decline in the number of pe hour in secondary school and the gap in sport provision between state and private school have continue to widen however there be shin example especially in place like weston super mare and the village that demonstrate the incredible difference that access to sport can make to child life broadoak academy under the leadership of its principal danny mcgilloway and his excellent team have make significant stride in promote sport for all it celebrate its young people with an annual sport personality of the year award one of the most exciting development for the school and the town be the introduction of girl football team in every year group for the first time this year that be huge milestone for the school ensure level playing field across gender it also ensure that girl can feel part of something big and empower that be the sort of structural change in school that really love there be also the hard fight for inclusive send playground at castle batch in worle and pay tribute to councillor catherine gibbons for her tireless effort to secure support for send kid in my patch those example from my constituency show what can be achieve when there be commitment to sport and physical activity for all the reality be however that too many school be still struggle with inadequate facility and limited resource want to take moment to recognise the incredible teacher coach parent carer and volunteer in our community who already go above and beyond to make sport possible for young people know that both my sister their husband and all the kid that surround my family have community sport at their heart love the joy and confidence that it bring to they all probably love it more because of the stark contrast with my experience of sport at school whether it be teacher stay late to run after school club grassroots football coach give up their weekend or parent fundraise for new kit those be people who be make real difference they should not have to do it alone we can get this right and ensure that sport and pe be available to every child no matter where they live or their circumstance thank my hon friend the member for stafford again for push this issue not just on behalf of her constituent but on behalf of all our constituent thank my hon friend the member for stafford leigh ingham my right good friend for secure the debate it have be great to hear so many hon member talk about the importance of sport in our school have slightly different experience from some of my colleague with pe in school because love it be right up for it have the pleasure of play for my school cricket team once have the pleasure of play for my school football team once be little bit well at basketball so get to play that twice it turn out that there be limit on how far enthusiasm will get you rugby union be my sport in school and at the risk of the northerners ire will say that rugby union be the correct code hon member oh that have not go down well we only ever have three fixture when be at school but absolutely love it also love go to pe lesson my background be really academic but use to love that break in the school day when we get to go out and do something slightly different it be important to recognise that follow that go off to university become teacher and teach for almost year hope to carry that background with during my time in this place we have hear lot about the health benefit of physical activity and absolutely agree with those point but have also see some of the transferable skill that kid teach pick up from their pe lesson and how that can contribute to well rounded education teach physics astronomy and little bit of math mostly at key stage and for old secondary pupil so my background be in an academic part of the school but support the debate because on top of all that run friday night sport club at my school where kid could come along and play ultimate frisbee the game find at university where the ceiling on where enthusiasm get you be slightly high in school too often there be temptation to play subject off some be academic and some be not some be more important and some be not those be binary that do not recognise not personally not from my experience and not from my experience in the classroom as much as support great science provision and great math teach subject such as music art drama and particularly pe be hugely important to every single individual in school not just to the kid who will go off to university or the kid who have more vocational route but to every single kid because of the soft skill they pick up such as teamwork resilience and just be able to react to anything outside their control anybody who have ever try to chase an egg around rugby field will know it be bounce you have no idea where you be go and you have to think on your foot often while be chase by stone of very rare meat sport push you out of your comfort zone to use skill that we all rely on day in day out in fact know that the skill use in my role here come much more from some of the sport have experience and some of the soft skill have develop than my university education which pay lot more for sport in school be also an amazing way to build community see that in my constituency couple of week ago be at the rugby watch lichfield play tamworth and it be really great to see some of the old boy and the gentle rivalry between the guy who go to friary or year ago and the guy who go to king ed or year ago while be sit in the corner from nether stowe the community that they have build around there be community of rugby player but within that there be gentle rivalry and it come from that school experience it be hard to replicate although we also see it up the road in chasetown football club which be call the scholars because it be set up by pupil from chase terrace high school there be example in everybody constituency it be really important that we keep school and pe at the heart of school keep pe in the classroom and keep the classroom on the field sometimes thank my hon friend the member for stafford leigh ingham for bring this important debate to the house be pick last be very much my experience of pe at school it be interesting that the majority of people who have speak in this debate be not very good at sport there be rule in the parliamentary football team that mp have to start have to say that be the footballer who have push that rule to its limit lead to the question how quickly can we sub chris off and bring on well player before this debate on the suggestion of my hon friend for stafford reach out to some of my local school in harlow to hear about their good practice and to find out about some of the challenge they face people will know that harlow have proud history of sporting excellence it be the childhood town of glenn hoddle the birthplace of laura trott not the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott who be now laura kenny have to mention long distance runner michael casey because he be now local journalist and my sporting hero the paralympian anne strike mbe two school be very quick to get back to about what they be do in harlow thank luke hammond the pe lead from purford green primary school for his quick response and what he share from his school and the wide passmores co operative learning community which be strong advocate for physical education he tell that they have do up to event in the past year alone they purchase and lend out bike as part of bikeability programme and create their own sporting event believe it be call tchoukball and dedicated festival to support send student to do pe as well as girl only tag rugby tournament where over student participate he particularly want to pay tribute not just to the staff in his school but to the staff in primary school and school across harlow who work collaboratively in coalition to support one another my hon friend the member for mid cheshire andrew cooper mention the decision by the coalition government in have to say that be old enough to have be teach at the time of that change although be pleased that jerounds primary school in my constituency continue to excel in ensure student have at least two pe lesson week it also invite people into the school include representative of essex cricket club which we know be the good cricket team in the country there be not enough people to boo that my hon friend make brilliant case for access to sport could challenge he on his last claim but he be such doughty champion for harlow and thank my hon friend the member for stafford leigh ingham who bring we together for the debate do he agree that sometimes school sport can fall off when we talk about elitism elite athlete the olympics and all that will he champion the culture media and sport committee report that we be work on we take evidence the other day it be on community and school sport and the challenge face sport club and under represent group school be central to that and as an ex teacher know he will agree my hon friend mention that be teacher before do oh no do mention it you look too young thank you my hon friend make an important point and what be interesting from hon member contribution be that none of we particularly excel at sport certainly do not but we have see sometimes in late life how important participation in sport be she be right that it be not just about elitist sport we could talk about harlow parkrun where people come together as community and take part in sport every saturday morning there be so many example where sport do not need to be elitist of course we want people to excel at sport and of course we want the next laura kenny or glenn hoddle but we want people to enjoy sport the impact it have on their mental health be huge thank my hon friend for the work she be do on the select committee to champion that point and look forward to that be feed into the curriculum review increase transport cost be among the big challenge that teacher have raise with for some harlow parent struggle financially and low income family transport their child to away fixture be just not possible my hon friend the member for stafford and the other bit mention the lionesses we have all be inspire by lucy bronze and other in that team and young girl in harlow have be inspire by they as well however many girl and young woman in harlow have to leave harlow to go to bishop stortford of all place to access sport so we clearly need to do more to ensure that sport facility be readily available and close enough for everybody to go to they as someone who be not the most sporty person in the world but appreciate the value of sport my plea to the government be to invest in pe in our school because it help develop skill such as resilience and physical and mental health as mention previously it should not be just for elite athlete it should be for everybody to enjoy even slightly over the hill former math teacher before call the front benchers it be important to put on the record that too be always pick last call max wilkinson thank you madam deputy speaker you would always be my first pick interruption sorry that be terrible start be it let do well otherwise my joke will end up go down like the us stock market the hon member for cannock chase josh newbury mention rounder and the hon member for weston super mare dan aldridge mention the school that go to that take right back to my gcse pe assessment where we be tell that we would do rounder because it be the easy and we would get good grade as result regret to inform the house that get three out of seven for rounder have no idea how and that lead to my failing to get grade at gcse pe hon member aw know and become the liberal democrat culture media and sport spokesperson despite that failure not that grade be failure will get serious now we be in the midst of crisis of sedentary lifestyle and obesity almost third of child and young people be class as inactive more than one in four child be either overweight or obese and the mental health crisis among young people be widely acknowledge to be totally out of control not least because of the subject of the previous debate on social medium these fact shame our nation and store up huge problem for our economy our health service and individual that be why the debate be timely and commend the hon member for stafford and the village for secure time in the chamber because instill love of sport and exercise in young people can do so much to turn around and tackle the public health crisis and that start in school for and for many of we my early memory of take part in sport be of play football on the primary school playground but know from first hand experience what happen when school do not have the facility to offer proper pe lesson when attend broadoak school in the constituency of the hon member for weston super mare it be fall down and we have one playing field leave for the whole time we be there we be all cram on to it at break time that mean we be not able to play as many fixture as we otherwise might have do be too weedy for rugby and the guy who be captain the football team just pick his mate and do not like so it make little difference to my school experience but it do have an impact on many other it probably have an impact on what else go on at the school which struggle with difficult catchment area although rarely take to the field for my school team do achieve something brilliant in the fourth division of the cardiff university intramural game score from the halfway line against the japanese society moment will never forget nor will anyone else who be on the pitch that day on more serious note hour of physical education have be lose from the curriculum in the last decade that be travesty state secondary school in england teach hour of pe in down from have many high perform independent school in my constituency and many good state school but the difference in provision between the independent and state sector be mark we need to ensure that the state sector be provide the very good for child the proportion of pupil in year and who can swim the standard metre have fall in the last eight year with disparity evident among demographic group give rise to concern about equality that be not surprising because school pool have be lose over the last year swim england say that the department for education can not even provide statistic due to the number of school not properly report swimming lesson sport england suggest put pe at the heart of the curriculum by protect time for it and subject it to suitable rigour it suggest really important change from traditional school approach that we reimagine the pe curriculum so that it be base on enjoyment and meaning rather than force people to go into scrum and run into each other on the pitch that be wise because not everyone be into that kind of sport they might be into yoga dance or something else let we be expansive about this enjoyment be the single big factor that drive up the number of minute that child spend play sport the lawn tennis association be among the body call for we to enact the chief medical officer recommendation for one hour of sport and physical activity to be deliver inside and outside school every single day to do its bit the lta be offer free teacher training and grant for equipment it be also ask for clarity about the future funding of the park tennis project and hope the minister can provide that clarity or take the matter up with her colleague the medical expert and sport organisation know what be screamingly obvious to everyone else sport and physical activity be the silver bullet for solve our public health crisis if we can get it right by instill healthy habit among people at an early age and then provide they with opportunity through their life much of the rest of the challenge we have in the nhs will fall into place it be not fashionable to say that because we be suppose to just stand up and shout save the nhs but think we in this place all know that it be much more complex than that facility be core to the challenge in my constituency be support pittville school effort to upgrade its badly outdated sport hall when the kid play badminton the shuttlecock hit the ceiling the school have be wait for age to get its application through the planning system one of the local council have remarkably raise an objection on conservation and heritage ground hope ministers agree that the planning system should be make it easy for school to build more sport facility not get in the way hope ministers will also consider designate sport hall and swimming pool as critical health infrastructure that be really important idea for ministers to take forward because in these straiten time it cost the taxpayer nothing to do that in february so long ago that have full head of hair ofsted publish report recommend that school spend at least two hour week on pe all these year on there be still no requirement for school to provide those two hour we want to ensure that every child have access to high quality pe as well as extracurricular sport activity that would ensure that all child have access to some form of physical education which be not always the case we need to restore those two hour can the minister confirm that the government be consider that school also serve as an important gateway to sport club the sport and recreation alliance be call for well link between school and sport club something the liberal democrats pass policy on as long ago as be that one simple change part of the government agenda we all know that the government be deal with tight finance but it be important to note that every pound invest in sport be likely to generate return on our investment of more than can not think of well investment for this nation to make we in this place often talk about the pressure on the nhs and about make proper effort to ensure that child benefit from love of sport and activity if we can marry those two up we will ensure that many child who be grow up to be obese unhealthy and depressed be save from that fate if we fail to get this right member from across the chamber can carry on say save the nhs and complain about wait time as much as we like but it will not make difference all we will ever be do be deal with an epidemic of chronic physical inactivity and mental illness cause by inactivity we will be deny generation to come love of sport and physical activity which would be dereliction of duty on the part of we all call the shadow minister be grateful for the opportunity to respond to today important debate on access to sport and physical education in school thank the hon member for stafford leigh ingham for secure this debate and all hon member here for speak about this vital issue which cut across our approach to education health mental wellbeing and social mobility at its heart physical education be about give every child regardless of background the chance to lead healthy active life while learn important life skill such as teamwork resilience perseverance and respect for other sport be about so much more than just be healthy it create opportunity and can transform life indeed many of our country most famous sporting hero begin their athletic journey while still at school olympic champion dame jessica ennis hill write about the positive impact that sport have on she play sport as child help enormously meet lot of different people both teammate and competitor and face new challenge the camaraderie and support that you get from sport massively help build my confidence and my ability to overcome setback and defeat both on and off the track it be precisely because sport have the power to do so much good that conservative members work so hard to make real measurable progress on improve access to sport and pe in our school when we be in government let start with what we do the last conservative government take clear stand in favour of equal access to sport for all child girl and boy alike in march the department for education publish new guidance for school make it clear that boy and girl must be offer the same sport both during curriculum pe and in extra curricular activity for too long some pupil have miss out because of outdated or inflexible provision and that be no long acceptable our new standard ensure that opportunity in school sport be not determine by sex it be drive by fairness aspiration and choice that guidance follow the success of the football association letgirlsplay campaign which aim to change perception and ensure that girl get the chance to play football as part of the school curriculum as well as at break time after school and at local club it have prove very successful much large number of girl be play football inspire by our amazing lionesses follow their success at the euro tournament but that be not all we do our school sport and activity action plan set out the clear expectation that school would provide minimum of two hour of pe per week we take that step because we know that exercise be not luxury or an optional extra it be fundamental to child physical health mental wellbeing and ability to focus and succeed in the classroom in addition to consider what happen during school hour we take decisive action to boost participation across the country in august we launch our get active strategy which provide for new national taskforce include government official education expert and former sport professional the taskforce be give the bold mission of get million more adult and million more child physically active by those serious ambition be back by serious action and they reflect long term strategic commitment from the last conservative government to increase participation promote inclusion and tackle the root cause of inactivity do not pretend for one moment that the job be do there be more to do but be proud of our record in this field however regret to say that there have be fallout from this government budget we be see evidence that the decision to end business rate relief for independent school be have damaging consequence some such school now question whether they can continue to operate community sport facility include school playing field lest we forget those facility be use not just by the school but by local primary school community group youth sport team and family see the benefit of that on my doorstep many child in my constituency attend local primary school be learn to swim and get the benefit of other sport facility at their local independent school if this policy end up force the sale or closure of those facility it will only have succeed in reduce access to sport for the very community who most need it be disappointed that the government have choose to scrap the opening school facility fund programme design to keep school sport hall and play field open over the holiday and outside school hour that fund enable school to support healthy active lifestyle all year round not just during term time in addition will the minister end the uncertainty and finally confirm the government plan for the school games network which be set to end this year the network support million participation opportunity for child and be hugely valuable will she confirm that that have not be scrap as well want to take moment to recognise the importance of access to sport for disabled young people as powerfully set out by the hon member for beckenham and penge liam conlon and for thornbury and yate claire young it be vital that barrier to inclusion be remove so that disable young people can benefit in the same way as all other child in school can not speak about the importance of sport without touch on the subject of sex the concern trend of gender ideology threaten to undermine effort to promote sport among young woman and girl let be clear it be body that play sport not feeling in woman and girl sport participant must be separate by sex not only for safety reason but for fundamental fairness former olympic swimmer sharron davies mbe have be warn about the negative impact of this issue on woman sport for many year and it be important that she and other advocate for woman be listen to urge the minister to ensure that as soon as possible we finalise and issue the draft guidance for school and college on gender question child which be prepare under the last conservative government and which make it clear that sport participant should be split by sex until we act to address the rise in environment where young female athlete feel unsafe or simply can not ever win how can we feign surprise when girl be less inclined to participate in sport the conservatives believe that access to sport and pe be fundamental part of good education for boy and girl we believe that child should be give the tool to live healthy active life and that sport build confidence resilience and teamworking skill not just health and fitness those be belief that we put into practice in government through new equality standard mandate pe entitlement and join up national strategy and by allocate fund to widen access to facility that be how we build healthy fair and more active future for every child in this country look forward to hear from the minister about how the government will seek to ensure access to sport and to her response to all the excellent question ask by member include mine congratulate my hon friend the member for stafford leigh ingham who represent stafford eccleshall and the village on secure the debate will henceforth refer to she as my hon friend the member for stafford thank she for her powerful opening speech be hop that her application for this debate would be grant as it be subject that feel incredibly passionate about and know that every member in the chamber who have speak feel that way too every child deserve an enriching and rounded education and pe and sport play key part in achieve that as many have say access to sport improve health outcome boost wellbee and build resilience as be show by tane the student my hon friend mention that be not just theory know that from personal experience my experience be the opposite of that of my hon friend the members for hertford and stortford josh dean and for lichfield dave robertson the day from school that remember well be the day spend with friend play hockey tennis and netball those day build my confidence and get through the school gate in the morning when quite frankly the academic subject be not appeal that be why believe that we need to break down the barrier that prevent child from access and enjoy sport and pe that be key the importance of access and enjoy pe sport and physical activity at school come out very strongly in today debate know my hon friend the member for hertford and stortford wholeheartedly agree as he go on to explain because we can not deliver on our ambitious plan for change as government without it our mission lead government have commit to put child and young people at the heart of our priority ensure that every child can achieve and thrive as part of the opportunity mission we will get more child active by protect time for pe and support the role that grassroots club play in expand access to sport have really enjoy listen to the contribution of hon member today particularly on their personal experience of sport include those from my hon friend the members for cannock chase josh newbury for weston super mare dan aldridge and for lichfield who be very honest about their experience of sport agree with they that we have to broaden opportunity so that every child can find an activity they enjoy we be not alone in that mission as have hear so clearly from young people school charity national sporting body and hon member in recent week have have the pleasure of meeting with the sports minister with sporting body and just this morning with baroness campbell who speak with great passion about ensure that sporting opportunity be available for everybody not just the privileged few in few than half of child and young people meet the chief medical officer guideline to be active for minute day it be clear that there be inequality and disparity among those less likely to participate whether they be girl child from poor background or child from black and minority ethnic group have see numerous example of school and their pupil benefit from resource teacher training and exclusive offer provide by sport governing body there be some fantastic example such as the lawn tennis association youth school portal and chance to shine in cricket which have the pleasure of join

particularly my hon friend the members for mid cheshire andrew cooper and for harlow chris the big community that can exist around sport which also support its effective delivery within school to build on that network school have to provide further opportunity to play sport and take part in other activity the vast majority of school offer extracurricular sport and physical activity and the dfe

community thank all the member who have come to the chamber today to speak on this subject and also the shadow spokespeople it have be one of the most fun debate that have take part in even though interestingly lot of the member who speak like myself be not necessarily the most sporty at school the memory that this debate have clearly evoke in many of we have be pleasure to listen to particularly thank my hon friend the member for beckenham and penge liam conlon and the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young prior to be elect the hon lady and be councillor together in south gloucestershire and she and participate in some sport activity it be nice to be able to recollect that memory my hon friend the members for mid cheshire andrew cooper for redditch chris bloore

within the dfe and know that as soon as those funding arrangement can be confirm she will be in touch as say early in the debate and as we have hear from member across the house this be not just about fitness or fun it be about the long term health resilience and success of our young people thank everyone present for participate in today debate with that at the forefront of their mind question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider access to sport and pe in school adoption breakdown motion make and question propose that this house do now jones be pleased to have secure this debate on this important issue which be rarely discuss yet profoundly impact thousand of family across the uk the crisis of adopt child leave the family home prematurely want to highlight this issue of adoption breakdown which sometimes might be day month or even year after an adoption order be sign adoption be not just legal process but lifelong commitment that demand sustain support from government at present that support be simply not in place after meet family in my constituency who have experience an adoption breakdown be deeply alarm by the lack of support available once an adoption order be sign since secure this debate have be inundate by message from people and family across the country share their live experience the overwhelming consensus be clear adoptive parent feel isolated and force to navigate the challenge of raise child with trauma and complex need without sufficient support often result in adoption breakdown the reality be that many adoption face profound challenge the trauma loss and attachment difficulty experience by adopt child do not simply vanish once an adoption order be grant those challenge persist often surface as complex behavioural emotional and psychological difficulty that demand long term specialist support accord to adoption uk of adoptive family report that their child have significant social emotional and mental health need many be diagnose with condition such as foetal alcohol spectrum disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or post traumatic stress disorder yet post adoption support remain inconsistent and inadequate force family into exhausting battle just to access the help they desperately need for many adoptive parent raise child who have suffer early life trauma be an immense challenge many endure physical aggression verbal abuse and school exclusion they feel abandon leave without clear pathway to support and when crisis emerge the system often respond too late if at all the issue that my hon friend raise be spot on would he agree that the more trauma inform training we have within school the well these young people will be able to be accept and support within school rather than potentially demonise thank my hon friend for that intervention and will come on to that important point later in my speech major challenge in tackle adoption breakdown be the lack of reliable datum we have little understanding of the true scale of the problem make it hard to assess the effectiveness of current policy or plan for meaningful improvement local authority which be mean to provide support frequently fail to help parent face those significant challenge in raise child with complex need and that be worsen by the absence of clear specific policy to prevent or respond to adoption breakdown there be an urgent need for well datum have meet number of adoption charity and organisation in beckenham and penge and they have tell that adoption breakdown can lead to significant emotional trauma for child and adoptive parent and many other implication do he agree on the need to bring local authority government and family together first to try to prevent adoption breakdown but then where it occur to take action to support both parent and child the hon member raise an excellent point that be exactly the case and have hear exactly those point from many adoption charity across the uk our focus must also be on try to make sure that there be clear policy and improve support system and address the gap be the only way to reduce adoption breakdown and ensure that every child have the chance to grow up in loving and stable environment our focus must shift to enhance the support structure available to family post adoption while the current framework be well intentione it be insufficient raise adopt child be make more difficult by barrier to vital special educational need and disability service and mental health support increase investment in service such as counselling educational support and respite care could significantly improve outcome the most recent government research and datum that could find on adoption disruption date back over decade it be the department for education beyond the adoption order research paper publish in the paper estimate disruption rate of between and since then there have be no significant follow up or research and if we be to address this issue it be vital that we have that up to date information on disruption to properly assess and respond to the challenge that parent face currently local authority and regional adoption agency record datum inconsistently create an incomplete picture of the national situation the department for education report that child enter local authority care after be adopt in the year to march average adoption per constituency however be aware that three adoption break down in my constituency of harrogate and knaresborough in the same time period so the data be clearly patchy the discrepancy highlight significant gap in our understanding of the prevalence of breakdown how can the government possibly expect to adequately support those affect when they do not fully understand and comprehend the extent of the issue in speak to adoptive parent regardless of whether they face disruption or not clear theme emerge support often vanish once the adoption order be sign motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now jones while the early stage of adoption may involve training and some resource the ongoing assistance tend to dwindle after child be place many adoptive parent especially those care for child with complex need report feel isolated and overwhelmed as local authority frequently fail to offer consistent tailor support have be approach by my constituent about their breakdown as we do not have any datum we do not know how many parent be struggle in our constituency do the hon member agree that if we do not identify adopter and support they we will not have any adopter in the future that be one of the key point about adoption disruption and breakdown and the hon gentleman make it very eloquently there be concern that if we do not help people who be adopt now we will not have next generation of people who will adopt be grateful to the hon member for secure today debate we know from adoption uk adoption barometer that of family experience challenge or crisis it also note that it can take they an average of five month to get the support they need and we need to shrink that timeframe do he agree that we need to have money reserve for the urgent support that these family need the hon member be exactly right and put she point eloquently far too often family and child be leave wait which cause additional pressure that can lead to adoption breakdown so completely agree with she as say while the early stage of adoption may involve training and some resource the ongoing assistance tend to dwindle apply for this debate after meet some of my constituent at regular surgery ian and verity experience this issue at first hand when their adopt child begin exhibit violent behaviour when they reach out for help they be shock to discover just how little be available to they unfortunately like many service post adoption support have become postcode lottery available service be often fragment underfunded and difficult to access leave parent without the necessary help to manage the challenge thank the hon gentleman for secure the debate as he know be an adoptive parent and foster carer in the run up to this debate have the opportunity to speak to the social worker who be support and my husband with what we hope will become our second adoption and would like to get the hon gentleman view on some of the thing she mention the importance of have well access to more holistic support in school close work between psychologist and adoption team to maximise the use of the adoption and special guardian support fund therapeutic life story worker to work with child and family particularly those at great risk of breakdown and great training in social work course on key issue such as early trauma and attachment to widen the knowledge across the workforce and ensure that wide range of team can support adoptive family when they come across they do the hon gentleman agree that such measure would go long way towards keep adoptive family together have have the pleasure of meet the hon gentleman child and look forward to meet more in due course he make an excellent point will come on to everything he say when set out the wish list from adoptive parent to the minister and be sure she will respond to the good of her ability within the constraint of what the government can do when ian and verity reach out to be shock by how the local authority and local service have fail they when they reach crisis point they request an intervention from the local authority but instead of receive help they be threaten with police action for child abandonment ultimately they be force to disrupt the adoption cause trauma to both the child and the entire family have ask people to email their story and common repeat theme be local authority use child abandonment charge as scare tactic which be deeply worrying the advocacy group patch have highlight how family face adoption crisis be often meet with punitive approach that fail to acknowledge the impact of trauma on these child as result family break down because they can not access the resource need to address those challenge have hear from many family that have experience breakdown and instead of receive support when they have face violent and threaten behaviour from their child they have be meet with blame threat and criticism culture of blame adoptive parent persist leave they isolated and without the help they need many adoptive parent be not fully inform about the child need before adoption thank the hon member for secure this very important debate do he agree that under article of the united nations convention on the right of the child when child can not be look after by their own family they should be look after by those who respect or represent their ethnicity their culture their religion and their language with bame child be disproportionately represent and unfortunately very vulnerable do he agree that this be about not just find place for child but find the right place for they thank the hon member for that intervention he make good point we have end up in situation where local authority be try to recruit anyone to adopt and it be often scramble to find any place so place do not necessarily always meet the need of or provide the good option for those child think that be the nature of the situation we find ourselves in with the service at crisis point many family that have be in touch have also say that support for adoptive family be often limit to the adoption and special guardianship support fund this fund seem to have become bit of stick plaster to allow local authority to claim that they be support family with adopt child while the fund be massively helpful it be often the only resource that people can turn to as the minister mention number of time during tuesday urgent question local authority have legal obligation to support family who have adopt however this fund be often inadequate and it be the extent of support in many area it be not an instant fix and it be often only available to family once they have reach crisis point as the hon member for york central rachael maskell say family often report wait for month six month and upwards to access fund and support due to delay by local authority during this waiting period crisis can escalate and family be push close and close to breakdown thank the hon member for secure such an important debate during the process of put together his speech be sure he read the local government and social care ombudsman report from last november which detail litany of failure across england in support adoptive parent for the most heartbreaking element of read the report and its recommendation be the number of family who say that they be put off the process or drive out of it by the bureaucratic failure and the lack of support on offer thank the hon member for his intervention and that be one of the key point will turn to example of where people try to access that fund but many people do give up which be such shame for the child involve be grateful to my hon friend for give way the number of intervention he have take show how important this debate be to the house too have have adoptive parent come to my surgery who be go through breakdown and they have tell that their experience of adoption be well in the past because they use to have name person support they at the council that council service have merge with those of eight other borough so it be now nine borough service adoptive parent no long have name contact and they have to go through central hotline do my hon friend agree that the adoption breakdown rate be increase partly because of the funding environment for local government and that we need to improve that first to get this service fix thank my hon friend for that intervention the point he make be one that experience at first hand when we have local government reorganisation in north yorkshire people have comment that the merging of service lead to an inferior outcome at the end agree with his point about need great funding for local authority to help fix this problem the government must ensure swift distribution of the new funding announce early this week to prevent future delay for many family that be already struggle the support fund be lifeline delay in therapy increase anxiety and distress not only for these child but for their family as whole and it can cause huge disruption to their daily life in some case family have be leave without support for month or even year the prolonged period of uncertainty around the support fund have cause an exacerbation in woe and fear many family feel they have be abandon by the system and have struggle to navigate complex and fragmented network of support service it be clear that the system be fail the family it be design to support the unpredictable nature of service access mean child and family be leave to fend for themselves the government must urgently address the chronic underfunding of adoption support service and commit to ensure that family have timely and reliable access have hear countless story from adoptive parent and child who speak about the deep trauma of what happen when an adoption break down the impact be not just emotional it can extend to physical and social challenge as well and lead to behavioural problem mental health struggle and difficulty in school in some case point make early by another member be that key barrier to provide that support be the lack of training for professional work with adopt family teacher social worker and healthcare provider all lack an understanding of the unique challenge that adoptive parent and adopt child face that lack of knowledge result in misguided intervention and insufficient care adoptive parent require more than just financial assistance they require access to specialist include trauma inform mental health care educational support and respite care too lived experience be at the heart of this issue and countless adoptive parent have share their story of pain struggle and heartache they be not just statistic they be real family grapple with unimaginable challenge and receive little to no support in the time leave will try to briefly share some of those story one parent write to about how an adopt child have suffer severe abuse despite their good effort the child behaviour become increasingly violent and unmanageable when they reach out for help they be meet with indifference by the local authority eventually the situation become so unbearable they have no choice but to disrupt the adoption leave heartbreak in its wake another adoptive parent share the story of child who have be through numerous foster placement before be adopt despite the child significant trauma the family be dedicate to provide love and stable home however due to lack of support and the inability of the local authority to help meet the child need eventually another adoption break down the parent feel ashamed and abandon by the system that promise to support they as we reflect on those story we must remember that behind every statistic be child who have already endure more than enough and more than most these child deserve the same opportunity to thrive as any other but they can not achieve that without the right support it be our responsibility to ensure that adoptive family be equip with the resource tool and understanding to provide that we need system that place support at the centre of the adoption journey from the moment child be place to the challenge they face during adolescence it be not enough to provide support just in the early stage and walk away once the adoption order be grant and the child appear settle we need cultural shift in how adoption breakdown be view parent should never be make to feel guilty for seek the support they so desperately need the live experience of family impact by adoption breakdown serve as reminder of why change be necessary adoptive parent do not want to bear the blame for breakdown many of which be cause by systemic failure they want to be part of the solution these family have open their heart and home yet they feel abandon we can no long allow adopt child and their family to fall through the crack decisive action be require now will set out few thing that the government could do to try to help with this issue we need commitment and guarantee that the adoption and special guardianship fund will be make permanent and that we will never see return to the year by year situation that have cause heartache and pain for child and parent this time around we need to mandate regular keeping in touch opportunity for all adoptive family too many family feel isolated without clear support network during time of crisis we must improve local authority support structure family must have guarantee access to crisis intervention service and mental health support before situation become unmanageable we must ensure that health and education professional be train in early trauma and care experience we can not expect teacher social worker or mental health professional to support adopt child without properly train they and give they the resource would like to see an extension of adoption support service to at least the age of trauma do not end at and young people need continue access to support as they transition into adulthood we need to provide target support pathway for teen and young adult include access to specialist advocacy service mental health care and intervention to prevent exploitation and criminal involvement before conclude would like to share few other personal story there be one which stand out it be from somebody who get in touch after put out an appeal for story ve be reflect on my adoptive son life story and want to share some statistic with you and the service involve social workers plus placement with only three regulated plus carer innumerable police officer innumerable fire officer five care home manager four headteacher five teaching assistant judge include eight high court judge three gps two dentist plus class teacher two behavioural analyst three play therapist one psychologist one child guardian the list go on and on adoptive child interact with service across the board but it be clear that they be be fail and pass from pillar to post hear another story from family whose adoption break down in january last year when their child be age just and only six month early they have celebrate their anniversary as family by go to paris like many other adopter they have several happy year before thing start to go wrong the family believe combination of inappropriate education hormone peer pressure social medium and possibly most significantly trauma from childhood be the cause of dramatic change to cut long story short thing get so bad that myself and my husband both suffer breakdown and the child go into care we be lucky that we be in regular contact the current system leave far too many family struggle with inadequate support which often result in disruption that could have be prevent with early target intervention and support without accurate datum clear policy and sustain funding we can not address the root cause of adoption breakdown or provide the resource need to ensure successful adoption call on the government to make sure further action be take post adoption to ensure that there be no postcode lottery and that local authority be hold accountable for provide the support that family need these child have already face immense trauma and instability and they deserve well adoptive parent who open their heart and home should never be leave feel abandon when they seek help we need urgent and meaningful reform to mental health service and access to send and we need to establish robust long term framework for post adoptive care will close by thank everyone who have reach out to share their deeply personal story and especially my constituent ian and verity we must reject the idea that adoption be one time event it be lifelong journey that require continuous and specialist support to every adoptive parent struggle in silence and to every young person feel abandon by the system say you be not alone today we ask those in position of authority and power to listen learn and act congratulate the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon on secure this important debate have indeed listen and hear his many concern issue and question there have be great number of intervention from many hon member across the chamber and will endeavour to respond to those too the story that the hon gentleman mention be heartbreaking on the back of that would also like to say that there be many many positive story of adopt child and their success where thing have go incredibly well just want to give bit of balance know that when an adoptive parent adopt child they want to do their very good for they to bring they into their family love they show they security and help they to thrive grow and develop in every way possible know that people across this chamber share that view and that we all want the very good for adopted child and adoptive parent support adoptive family and prevent adoption breakdown be priority that know all member across the house support as the minister for children it be significant priority for too so be pleased to be able to respond to this debate support child through adoption be manifesto commitment for this government every child deserve and need love and stable family home which be exactly what adoption can should and must provide improve support for adopt family be key part of our plan for change to ensure that every child have the opportunity to succeed we inherit system in which far too many family be miss out on vital post adoption support service we recognise that we need to improve our knowledge of adoption breakdown and be take action to improve the statistic the datum we collect and other form of research the number of child who return to the care system who have an adoption order have remain between and in each of the past five year however these figure be not as robust as we would like they to be and we will be challenge local authority to improve the accuracy of their return in particular we need social worker always to record when child enter care be live under an adoption order we do not collect specific information on adoption breakdown where the child do not return to care some adopt young people will go to live with birth relative and other to live independently at the age of or without the knowledge of the local authority sometimes this be for short period and sometimes they return home we know from previous research that around of adoption disrupt but this research be year old to gain more up to date information the government have be fund the new research family be sure member will be very interested to know more about that which be look at adopt child outcome this will give we new up to date information on adoption disruption and breakdown and the result will be publish later in the year high quality support for adopt child be critical it can decrease the likelihood of adoption disruption or breakdown research show that approximately one third of family be do well one third need extra support compare with other family and one third report that they be in crisis adoptive family often complain that they do not get the support they need when they be in crisis they often experience blame and criticism of their parental approach and there be lack of understanding about the impact of trauma on their child behaviour have ask regional adoption agency to put in place service this year that can respond quickly and effectively to adoptive family in crisis include trauma train professional who provide evidence base support we be also ensure that all social worker work well to understand the long term impact of trauma we recently publish new post qualify standard for social worker in which we say that all social worker should be train to use evidence and good practice to reduce the impact of any trauma increase the likelihood of secure relationship and ensure improved outcome for the future wonder whether the minister have hear of the outstanding charity home for good which use faith base group to support family through either fostering or adoption do the minister believe that there be opportunity to give they extra support so that we can grow rich tapestry of support for those who adopt or foster yes know home for good have meet the people involve and they do excellent work on foster and adoption there be so much more that could be do so absolutely take on board what the hon member have mention be grateful to the minister for her commitment and for all that she be do in this area when young people be place in adoption can we look at ensure that there be more open adoption we certainly need to look at the datum on that we know that teenager find their birth parent can often lead to an adoption breakdown that teenager might never be able to restore relationship either with their birth parent or with their adoptive parent thank my hon friend for her comment adoption can be quite complex especially when child reach their teenage year as they be able to make contact through different social medium contact and how it be manage be under constant review we need to ensure that where it be appropriate where it be right and where it be safe contact continue for adopt child again stress that be where it be appropriate where it be right and where it be with the agreement of the adoptive parent much of that take place during the assessment process and the adoption order itself the majority of adopt child will have experience neglect or abuse which lead to ongoing and endure problem provide support for family at an early stage before need escalate to crisis point be critical we be fund adoption england to develop consistent and high quality adoption support provision across all regional adoption agency this include implement new framework for an early support core offer which cover the first to month after placement adoption england will also be roll out new adoption support plan book for all new adoptive family this year we will fund adoption england with million to develop more multidisciplinary team in regional adoption agency these be joint team with local health partner that will enable family to receive holistic high quality support thank the minister for set out the measure the government be take which be very welcome return to the conversation have with my social worker one of the suggestion she have be to have designate lead within local authority and adoption agency to ensure that support be there for adoptive family they could also work with team across the organisation that might not be as familiar with the challenge that adoptive family could face be that suggestion the minister might take away and look at congratulate my hon friend on his adoption and know he be foster carer as well which be wonderful appreciate what he say and will indeed take it away and come back to he the adoption and special guardianship support fund provide much need therapeutic support for adoptive and kinship family since over million have help to support nearly child and many have receive multiple year of support therapeutic intervention help child to deal with difficulty relate to their experience of trauma and to form attachment to their new adoptive parent they can also help prevent adoption breakdown evaluation of they show statistically significant positive impact on child behaviour and mental health in survey of adopter say that the support from the adoption and special guardianship support fund have have positive impact on their family much of that information can be find on the government website announce on tuesday that the adoption and special guardianship support fund would continue in this financial year with budget of million we recognise the importance of the adoption and special guardianship fund in help child to have good outcome and in prevent adoption breakdown it be great to hear the minister support for the fund but this year it be allow to expire before it be renew can we have assurance that we will get much well notice next time about the renewal of the fund appreciate what the hon member say if he be there during the urgent question on tuesday he would have hear my regret about the delay this government be commit to ensure that we continue to support adopt child through funding where it be need adopted child should receive support to obtain good educational outcome however many do not do so with poor gcse result than the overall population and high exclusion rate the adoption uk barometer report show that of adoptive parent in england be parent one or more adopted child with an education health and care plan adopted child be entitle to priority school admission as well as advice and support from school designate teacher and local authority virtual school head school will also receive in pupil premium plus this year for every adopt child in their school but we do need to go far we intend to fully update the statutory guidance for virtual school head include section on support adopt child educational outcome we will conduct public consultation to gain input from stakeholder ensure that the late research and example of good practice be incorporate local authority deliver adoption service through regional adoption agency work in partnership with voluntary adoption agency evaluation of regional adoption agency show that they provide more strategic approach to deliver adoption support include by early intervention become widely embed be enormously grateful to the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough for raise this issue he have raise some important concern many of which share adoption support be currently not good enough and we must do well this debate have give the opportunity to talk about our plan to ensure that all adopt child get the support they need to experience full and happy childhood question put and agree to house adjourn
