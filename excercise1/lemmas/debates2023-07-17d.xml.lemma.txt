member for stroud want great flexibility in the levy should vote labour in the next general election there be nothing that would make give such drastic advice the truth about the apprenticeship levy be that of it will be spend this year we can look in the rear view mirror and there be some report go back over time that show some underspend in the levy but they be back over time we be now spend of

reading standard today be broadly similar to those before the pandemic and since both reading and math have improve enormously in primary school throughout the country be confident that we will meet the target by call the scottish national party spokesperson we can not talk about attainment at any level without also take into account child poverty the link between undernourishment and low reading standard and therefore attainment across the board be irrefutable when child be hungry they can not focus on learn the scottish government be currently roll out free school meal for all primary school

increase hugely about third of child be now eligible for either benefit relate free school meal or the universal infant free school meal introduce by our government however the hon lady should be

west be home to two lead university heriot watt and edinburgh napier research by universities uk show that the constituency net economic benefit from international student be million the government plan to massage the net migration figure by make the uk less attractive to international student that be go to harm the economy in my constituency scotland economy and our educational institution can the minister tell be that an example of the union deliver for scotland be not quite sure what problem the hon and learn lady be try to solve mention to she that our target be international student we have surpass international student be come to our country which be something we be proud of but as say we have to be fair to not only international student and university but the taxpayer who bear the cost of the infrastructure but agree with the hon and learn lady that international student have huge impact on the economy of up to billion plus time after time we find that every government department be short of young graduate with digital skill will my right hon friend think about make an application to the home office to encourage more visa to be grant to student who want to take digital degree in this country my hon friend be learn in these matter but they be for the home office we be develop our digital skill at home with amazing digital apprenticeship half of our apprenticeship standard be in stem subject and there be level and high technical qualification in digital we be spend on the digital skill that our local people need we have to give they the skill they need as well institutional partnerships further and high education what step she be take to increase partnership between further education college and high education institution to help increase learn opportunity we be transform tertiary education by build state of the art prestigious institute of technology college back by million and lead by further education and high education business we have also introduce the lifelong loan entitlement it be in the house of lords at the moment that will allow high and further education to collaborate offer short course and the transfer of course between fe and he institution last week meet representative of the national farmers union at the great yorkshire show we discuss the great need for new skill and skilled workforce in area such as agro

through the national careers service which be advise people on adult skill we be spend hundred of million of pound on boot camp and on more than free level course our apprenticeship scheme offer hundred of different apprenticeship through career advice and our skill offer we be ensure that adult get the skill they need as work class kid from the constituency now represent be not sure where would be today if not for the opportunity have to study for so call mickey mouse degree at university after today medium push and the government apparent crackdown on student how do the minister expect we to believe that this be not just ruse to protect the privilege of the timothies and tabithas of the home county as oppose to working class kid the hon gentleman could not be more wrong why be it right to send somebody to high education institution take out significant loan of each year to take course that lead either to poor completion poor continuation or poor progression this government be stop that by impose recruitment cap on such course be proud that record number of disadvantaged student be go to university more disadvantaged student be go to university than ever before parent and pupil across stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke wait anxiously to find out the result of the fantastic bid make by the further education city of stoke on trent sixth form

staffordshire university which be model university that offer brilliant policing degree apprenticeship scheme among other the secretary of state be listen carefully to the bid and be sure she will make the announcement shortly call the shadow minister the introduction of the lifelong loan entitlement which we all support will inevitably require great collaboration between high education and further education provider but under the current regulatory system as the line between he and fe blur we be see significant regulatory duplication and increase burden this act as brake on partnership do the minister not recognise the need to streamline the regulatory system to foster collaboration ahead of rather than after the introduction of the lle the hon gentleman be absolutely right that the lifelong loan entitlement of up to will be transformative for million of people across the country enable they to take short or modular course at time of their choosing we be look at regulation across the high education and further education sector and we be do all we can to reduce it but recognise some of the issue he raise tuition fee social mobility what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of tuition fee on the social mobility of young people the introduction of tuition fee have not lead to few disadvantaged young people go into high education as have already highlight the year old entry rate for disadvantaged student in england increase from in to in we see record number of disadvantaged student go into high education in with the rate for student on free school meal go up from to thank the minister for that answer but in the last academic year english student graduate with more debt on average than their scottish counterpart despite this both the government and the labour party refuse to follow the scottish government lead by abolish tuition fee in england with more than undergraduate drop out of high education this year will this government admit that their policy be push student into debt and often out of university actually we be be fair both to student and to all those taxpayer who do not go to university might point out that low income student live away from home will qualify for more living cost support over the come year than low income student in scotland the new labour dream of of young people go to university have leave many saddle with debt third of graduate unable to find graduate job and more than half of graduate never earn enough to repay their student loan so warmly welcome the prime minister announcement today of reduction in the number of low value degree which benefit neither student nor taxpayer will the department look to go far by identify whole university that could be transform into high technical and vocational institution which would give far more young people the opportunity and training they really need for the productive job of the future my hon friend be absolutely right in the sense that the labour party be all about quantity over quality and we be about quality high standard and good education we be already do lot of what she want because we be introduce institute of technology which be collaboration between high education and further education that provide flagship skill and teach high technical qualification with across the country they be do exactly what she want we to do

this year and furth million in this be not just about school because we will also be invest million and million in our further education college over the same period all four union have recommend the pay award and it be fully fund hope that teacher will join they so that we can bring an end to strike action and get our teacher do what they do good teach the next generation uk student who have be offer opportunity to study abroad be wait for funding decision under the ture scheme clearly for student from less well off family this be tough as visa and accommodation have to be pay in advance will the secretary of state out of the kindness of her heart and to man from the highland give commitment to bring forward these decision next year to make the ture scheme more accessible to all student regardless of their background thank the hon gentleman for his question the ture scheme be great success disadvantaged student will take up two third of the international study and work opportunity from september with student go to different country it be remarkable scheme give that it have be introduce so quickly it be new demand lead scheme but will work with the sector to make improvement to it and make sure that people be fund in time attend meeting of the all party parliamentary group on fishery which normally chair where keenness be express to encourage young people to have an interest in career in fishing at the education stage have hear similar plea from farmer what more can the department do to make that reality my hon friend be true fisherman friend although lot sweet tasting than the lozenge might add she will be pleased to know that high quality apprenticeship standard in agriculture and level fisher apprenticeship be available we be promote apprenticeship include in agriculture in our school and through the apprenticeship support and knowledge programme and the careers enterprise company call the shadow secretary of state minister have know since last year that strike action by teacher be likely yet after month of refuse to talk it be only last week that the secretary of state finally settle the dispute will she take this opportunity to apologise to parent for the completely needless and avoidable disruption to their child education for which she be responsible since come into this job at the end of october the union ask for an extra billion and deliver it family ask for childcare and deliver it the school teachers review body ask for for teacher and deliver it and that have to be fund and have deliver it have work to deliver every day in this job whereas the hon lady can not even decide whether she will accept or not last week the institute for fiscal studies say that end private school tax break will raise up to billion in additional revenue confirm that labour plan be fiscally credible we would use that money to invest in new expert teacher and well mental health support for all our young people will the secretary of state distance herself from the discredited claim of the private school lobby do the right thing and adopt labour plan to drive up standard in our school labour have never drive up standard in our school most of our private school be nothing like eton or harrow they be far small and they charge lot less many cost the same as family holiday abroad and there be plenty of parent who choose to forgo life luxury to give their child those opportunity the ifs also say the effect might be large over the medium to long run there be still lot of uncertainty around these estimate labour tax hike be nothing more than the politic of envy as margaret thatcher once say the spirit of envy can destroy it can never build will the minister update my constituent on the progress be make towards open new free school in warrington to provide well and more appropriate education for young people with autism and other special educational need we recently change the location of the warrington free school from

and in this particular case what we have do as have do many time in my year business career be to go through every line of the budget we spend billion on education so there be lot of thing in that budget and we have go through it and check every single assumption some be demand lead and some depend on the roll out of certain project we have protect the frontline and reprioritise what have change be that the treasury have allow we to keep that money to it be an answer the right hon lady may not understand because she do not order be not sure the secretary of state be understand either when say these be topical mean order no be sorry if you do not want member on your side of the house to get in please say so because that be what be go to happen and it be totally unfair to the people who be wait let we play by the rule that be what we expect from all of we recently visit the impressive national stem learning centre in york and be fortunate enough to be able to observe some of its work would be delighted if my right hon friend could visit but in the interim can she detail what professional support be available for teacher in their continue professional development we have

of state achieve an extra billion in the autumn statement last year and we be now spend billion on school report july vol we have recruit more teacher this year than last year and we have record number of teacher in the profession at but of course be happy to talk to the hon lady and the teacher in her constituency to discuss their particular concern rise order be sorry we have take too much time on question you will have to do without high education reform with permission mr speaker would like to announce the publication of the government high education reform consultation response this country be one of the good in the world for study in high education boast four of the world top university for most high education be sound investment with graduate expect to earn on average more over their lifetime than those who do not go to university however there be still pocket of high education provision where the promise that university education will be worthwhile do not hold true and where an unacceptable number of student do not finish their study or find good job after graduate that can not continue it be not fair to taxpayer who subsidise that education but most of all it be not fair to those student who be be sell promise of well tomorrow only to be disappoint and end up pay far into the future for degree that do not offer they good value we want to make sure that student be charge fair price for their study and that university education offer good return our reform be aim at achieve that objective that be why the government launch the consultation in to seek view on policy base on recommendation make by sir philip augar and his independent panel the consultation end in may and the department for education have be consider the response receive be now able to set out the programme of reform that we be take forward believe that the traditional degree continue to hold great value but it be not the only high education pathway over the past year we have make substantial reform to ensure that the traditional route be not the only pathway to good career high technical qualification massively enhance student skill and career prospect and deserve parity of esteem with undergraduate degree we have see growth in degree level apprenticeship with over student enrol since their introduction in have ask the office for student to establish million competitive degree apprenticeship fund to drive forward capacity build project to broaden access to degree apprenticeship over the next two year that drive to encourage skill be why we be also invest up to million to help provider deliver high technical education in march we set out detailed information on how the lifelong learning entitlement will transform the way in which individual can undertake education and we continue to support that transformation through the lifelong learning high education fee limits bill which be currently pass through the other place we anticipate that that funding couple with the introduction of the lle from will help to incentivise the take up of high technical education fill vital skill gap across the country each of those reform have have one simple premise that we be educate people with the skill that will enable they to have long and fulfilling career believe that we should have the same expectation for high education it should prepare student for life by give they the right skill and knowledge to get well pay job with the advent of the lle it be neither fair nor right for student to use potentially three quarter of their lifelong loan entitlement for university degree that do not offer they good return that would constrain their future ability to learn earn and retrain we must shrink the part of the sector that do not deliver value and ensure that student and taxpayer be get value for money give their considerable investment datum show that there be provider from which few than of graduate progress to high skilled employment or further study fifteen month after graduate that be not acceptable will therefore issue statutory guidance to the ofs set out that it should impose recruitment limit on provision that do not meet its rigorous quality requirement for positive student outcome to help to constrain the size and growth of course that do not deliver for student we will also ask the ofs to consider how it can incorporate graduate earning into its quality regime we recognise that many factor can influence graduate earning but student have right to expect that their investment in high education will improve their career prospect and we should rightly scrutinise course that appear to offer limited add value to student on the metric that matter most to many we will work with the ofs to consider franchising arrangement in the sector all organisation that deliver high education must be hold to robust standard be concern about some indication that franchising be act as potential route for low quality to seep into the high education system and be absolutely clear that lead provider have responsibility to ensure that franchised provision be of the same quality as directly deliver provision if we find example of undesirable practice we will not hesitate to act far on franchising as have say we will ensure that student be charge fair price for their study that be why we be also reduce to the fee for classroom base foundation year course such as business study and social science in line with the high standard funding rate for access to he diploma recently we have see an explosion in the growth of many such course but limited evidence that they be in the good interest of student we be not reduce the fee limit for high cost strategically important subject such as veterinary science and medicine but we want to ensure that foundation year be not use to add to the bottom line of institution at the expense of those who study they we will continue to monitor closely the growth of foundation year provision and we will not hesitate to introduce further restriction or reduction want provider to consider whether those course add value for student and to phase out that provision in favour of broad range of tertiary option with the advent of the lle our aim be that everyone who want to benefit from high education have the opportunity to do so that be why we will not proceed at this time with minimum requirement of academic attainment to access student finance although we will keep that option under review be confident that the sector will respond with the ambition and focused collaboration require to deliver this package of reform extend my wholehearte thank to those in the sector for their response to the consultation this package of reform represent the next step in tackle low quality high education but it will not be the last step the government will not shy away from further action if require and will consider all lever available to we if these quality reform do not result in the improvement we seek our high education system be admire across many country and these measure will ensure that it continue to be commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement today statement tell we several story about this government it tell story about their priority why university and why now it tell story about their analysis what they think be wrong and what they think be not it tell story about their competence why these change when their own regulator have use different approach for so long it tell story about their prejudice about why they continue to reinforce binary choice for young people either academic or vocational university or apprenticeship above all it tell story about value about the choice to put cap on the aspiration and ambition of our young people about ministers for whom opportunity be for their child but not for other people child about government whose only big idea for our world lead university be to put up fresh barrier to opportunity anxious to keep young people in their place it tell you everything you need to know about the tories that this be their priority for our young people this be the tories priority when we be in the middle of an urgent crisis in this country when family be struggle to make end meet when patient be face the big waiting list in nhs history when child be go to school in building that ministers themselves acknowledge be very likely to collapse and when spiral of low productivity low growth and low wage under the tories be hold britain back it be because the prime minister be weak and he be in hock to his back benchers that we be not see action on those important priority instead after more than year in power the government have show what they really think of our university which be famous across the world be core to so many of our regional economy and be essential to our pandemic response that they be not public good but political battleground the government concept of successful university course base on earning be not just narrow but limit ask the secretary of state briefly to consider the case of the right hon member for richmond yorks rishi sunak the prime minister have degree in politic from one of our lead university yet his government lose control of almost council this year he be the second choice of his own party and now he be on track to fail to deliver on the pledge he set himself publicly do the secretary of state believe that the prime minister degree be in any sense high value course let we be clear what today announcement be really about many of our most successful new university the fruit of the determination of successive government labour and conservative to spread opportunity in this country often draw more student from their local community many of those area be far from london far from exist concentration of graduate job many of those student come from background where few in their family if any will have have the chance to go to university many of those young people benefit from extra support when they arrive at university to ensure they succeed we on the labour benches welcome the success of those university in widen participation and welcome more young people into high education yet today the secretary of state be tell those young people include those excited to be finish their study this year that this government believe their hard work count for nothing can the secretary of state be absolutely clear with the house and tell we which of those university course she consider to be of low value the secretary of state be keen to trumpet her party record on apprenticeship but let set out what this government record really be since apprenticeship start among have drop by and apprentice achievement in that age group be down by since the secretary of state enter this place the number of young people achieve an apprenticeship at any level have more than halve fail generation of young people desperate to take on an apprenticeship lastly and most importantly the value that this government have set out today be clear the conservatives be say to england young people that opportunity be not for they and that choice be not for they the bizarre irony of conservative government seek to restrict freedom and restrict choice seem entirely lose on they labour will shatter the class ceiling we will ensure that young people believe that opportunity be for they labour be the party of opportunity aspiration and freedom let we be clear too that young people want to go to university not merely to get on financially but for the chance to join the pursuit of learning to explore idea and undertake research that benefit we all that chance and that opportunity matter too our child deserve well they deserve government whose most important mission will be to break down the barrier to opportunity and to build country where background be no barrier they deserve labour government as usual the hon lady have more word than action none of those action be put in place either in wales where labour be run the education system or in the uk when it be run it in england we have always make the deliberate choice of quality over quantity and this be story of consistent drive for quality whether that be through my right hon friend the schools minister have drive up school standard so that we be the good in the west for reading and fourth good in the world or through childcare revolutionise the apprenticeship system none of that exist before we put it in place and technical education and high education be an other people child be that kid who leave school at who go to fail comprehensive school in knowsley rely on the business and the college and the university that go to do not know their brand image and know absolutely nobody who have ever be there put my trust in that company and luckily it do very well not all university and not all course have the trust brand image of oxford and cambridge which think be where the hon lady go along with my right hon friend the prime minister have work with many leader all over the world in my many year in business and the prime minister be world class leader on apprenticeship it be case of quality always over quantity what we find and this be why introduce the quality standard be that yes the number be high but many of the people do not realise they be on an apprenticeship many of the apprenticeship last less than month and for many of they there be zero off the job training they be apprenticeship in name only which be what the labour party will be when it come to standard for education call the father of the house thank the secretary of state those of we with long memory know that we either ration place by number or we give people choice if she be give people the choice of be able to discriminate between the course and university on offer congratulate she as do especially on the lifetime learning and the degree apprenticeship expansion which have already happen with more to come however can also speak up for those who either get fourth class degree or fail to take degree at all include two of the three governors of the bank of england who go to king and who come out without degree rabi tagore leave university and many other poet painter teacher or minister of religion whether rabbi imam or minister in the christian church do not show up highly on the earning scale but they might show up highly in their contribution to society can my right hon friend please make sure that she do not let an algorithm rate college course or university thank my hon friend for his remark and very much agree that this be about choice the lifelong loan entitlement degree apprenticeship and all of the other choice and about people understand that there be many different route to success in life we have ask the office for student to look at earning because realise that be difficult and that some job will not earn people more however for his information five year after graduate from some course people be earn less than that be less than the minimum wage and it be not acceptable may ask the secretary of state because she have not actually spell this out what be low value degree in relation to low value degree an example of the quality provision we have introduce for the office for students be which be about whether student continue in their degree because clearly if they drop out it be not of much value whether they complete their degree because clearly if they do not complete it it be of zero value and whether they get job or progress into high education afterwards those be the three quality measure we look at right now the office for students be look at provider and two specific area business and management and computer science because there be massive range in what people can expect to earn from job have follow one course or other all of which seem to have the same name there be quality issue and we want to make sure that they be thoroughly investigate the office for students be do that call the chair of the education committee welcome the focus on both choice and policy that my right hon friend have focus on in her statement the education committee will want to look at the detail of the proposal and at the kind of course that be affect it be crucial that in launch this approach she recognise that all our university be sell premium product all our university be high quality institution and it would be wrong to discriminate against different university in the system when after all they be all fund on the same fundamental basis agree with my hon friend and be proud of our university sector it be much admire all over the world but we must ensure that specific course in all institution offer the quality that people expect when people invest in these degree they will come out with or of debt and it be important first that they know that and secondly that they know what they be invest in and what return they will get on that investment may beg the secretary of state not to throw the baby out with the bath water everybody want good quality degree and we all want degree to lead to good fulfilling occupation but some of we be worried about the comment that be make in an interview this morning by the secretary of state ministerial colleague that we have four or five of the good university in the world as if all the other university be rubbish that be not the case we have diverse university and great course ask she please not to throw the baby out with the bath water and do great damage to our high education system agree with the hon gentleman we have an excellent university system with excellent university four out of the top be world class but if we broaden that to the top many other would appear in that list we have good university sector which be why it be most important that we protect the brand image it be also very popular abroad and every year more than student choose to come here which be more than to almost every other country in the world why it be because they know they will get quality and it be very important for the sector that that quality be maintain know the secretary of state take more than purely transactional view of high education and be with the father of the house in hop that in her reform there will be protection for degree that do not offer an immediate commercial advantage such as theology philosophy or the study of poetry also hope that within her reform there will be protection to allow university to innovate and introduce new course our university sector have obviously be at the forefront of drive forward british intellectualism and thinking and not allow university to experiment with course that may not immediately fulfil the criterion that she be propose or indeed forbid or deter they from do so would set we back in world term will she reassure we that innovation will still be encourage thank my right hon friend for all the work that he do in this area yes understand the difficulty of choose blunt number or tool that be why have ask the office for student to consider how such thing could be use and what approach we need to ensure that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water or end up with unintended consequence on innovation be absolutely encourage all our university to innovate work with business the pace of technological change across the world and what be to come in the future be immense and want our university to work with our further education college training provider business and other to ensure that we innovate and give everybody the good opportunity for the future there be no clear sign of government who be out of idea and have run out of steam than when they re announce policy and badge they as new the office for students already have these power and have already cap four specific provider rather than put down our university and cap our young people aspiration why do the secretary of state not invest in they by restore maintenance grant and finally sign the dotted line on horizon membership not all the thing have bring forward today have already be announce the information on foundation degree be new and the work we be do with the ofs be also new we have ask the ofs to consider the impact of recruitment limit and how those can be introduce personally think this be an important set of reform we need to make sure that we have access to these fantastic course at our university so that through programme such as horizon when we complete those negotiation we can continue to offer the very good in science from this country very much welcome this statement to limit the number of student that university can recruit to course that be fail the secretary of state have my full support can she tell whether this measure will also apply to foreign student at the very least will foreign student be bar from bring dependant with they to do these course the quality of the course on offer apply to everybody if we change the quality for domestic student it will then be the same quality for international student which be important because of the size of the international student sector which bring about billion to billion to our economy every year we have already address the issue of dependant for teach master course in our recent change to migration visa the secretary of state have confirm that the office for students already have the power to enforce on student outcome provision so this announcement be just narrow politicking hide in the ucas figure last week be the fact that home student application be fall in this country can the secretary of state confirm that this government policy be now one of narrow participation absolutely not no be delighted that the hon gentleman have ask this question because our policy be about widen participation and make sure that education be high quality it be also about make sure that there be more degree apprenticeship there be now which do not exist before there be now more people who can do what do as the only degree apprentice in the house of commons it be fantastic route into the workplace we also have high technical qualification and boot camp there be so much investment that have all happen under this conservative government do my right hon friend agree that the shadow secretary of state the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson miss the opportunity to condemn the disgusting and cruel university and college union mark boycott will my right hon friend use these reform to protect young people to ensure that this never happen again and that university such as cambridge and exeter can issue degree it be important young people have suffer already lot during covid they have invest in their degree and put all the hard work in it be only right that they should have their degree mark this be dispute between university and their lecturer but we be urge they to make sure they prioritise all those who will be graduate this year welcome the announcement today because for far too long some university cynically sell course to student even though they know the outcome be poor in qualification and employment opportunity do the minister accept that it be her party that allow the increase in fee be aware of the mismatch sometimes between course and the need of the economy and do nothing to cap those course do she not recognise that some people will be rather cynical that the tsunami of announcement we be get now be more to do with the by election rather than the ability to deliver between now and general election absolutely not have be work on this policy with many former ministers even since be the apprenticeships and skills minister we have be work on this for long time to make sure we get it right when work class kid who will come out with of debt put their trust in an institution they have to put their trust in the system and it be vital that the system deliver for they if they have of debt and no well job prospect that be not system deliver for they would it not benefit university course quality more if university administrator be pay lot less and university lecturer be pay rather more my right hon friend put his finger on debate that be go on in our university right now and know it be part of the discussion between university lecturer and university management have be around the block oxbridge red brick ex poly long enough to know that this statement reek of academic snobbery and desperation in cultural study people can legitimately analyse mickey mouse as subject of academic inquiry have ex student who do that who be now earn more than any of we in here when will the government address the thing that our constituent really want to be deal with such as crippling student debt and the massively reduced and minimal contact hour that the covid generation get the hon lady will be delighted about the datum that we now have if student have do those course go on to earn more do not know what her judgment be on those institution that will be absolutely fantastic that be all that we expect have two business and management degree and know business well have spend year in it but if people can not get good business job after do business and management degree would suggest that be not good quality degree one must recognise that my right hon friend be right to celebrate britain international high education success but do she agree that any change make must recognise the tremendous success of the worker at the university of bolton which have shoot up the guardian good university guide league table now to be place in the top my hon friend make an excellent point and know that he be big champion of the university of bolton which be delighted to meet recently it be quite interesting that lot of former polytechnic and new university be work and collaborate so well with business offer more degree apprenticeship and more flexible course and storm up the league table be concerned that many university degree that lead young people into the creative sector will be squeeze under the government plan industry leader have warn that limit student number base on graduate earning fail to account for the work pattern of graduate in the creative industry and particularly the art where people do not immediately earn high salary the salary in those profession do not reflect their importance to national wellbeing and the contribution that the art make to our national income what assessment have the department for education make of the damage that this late policy will do to those art and humanity subject that have already be relentlessly cut back under conservative lead government be huge supporter of our creative and art industry which be among our large and we be very successful in they work with they lot to ensure that we can deliver even broad apprenticeship route because they be difficult industry to get into have ask the office for student to consider how to do this reform to ensure that we consider thing like the creative art and other route which sometimes take long to get into but offer different aspect of learn that be why we have not just introduce blunt tool will continue to work with our fantastic creative sector congratulate my right hon friend and the department on their focus on excellence this morning attend the graduation ceremony of student from anglia ruskin university in chelmsford it be so move because for the first time in history student graduate as medical doctor in essex our investment five year ago in five new medical school across the country be shin example of conservative government invest for future need will she work with to try to double the number of medical student and encourage degree apprenticeship for doctor and will she congratulate our new doctor know that my right hon friend be huge champion of anglia ruskin university be delighted about the number of medical doctor and the new medical school which as she say be introduce under this government when be the apprenticeships and skills minister one of the last thing do and which be most proud about be to get medical doctor apprenticeship standard build and be delighted that that be be roll out from september look forward to anglia ruskin offer that as well be the first in my family to get university degree hope that be not the last will the secretary of state confirm that the tory party be the party of the blocker block aspiration and opportunity in high education as well as the building of affordable house no think that the hon member have get it completely wrong under the conservatives an year old from disadvantaged background be more likely to go to university than they be in under labour the rich student be seven time more likely to go to university than the poor in society welcome the secretary of state plan but want high education reform to go far recent paper by the new conservatives include an excellent suggestion to extend the closure of the student dependant route to student enrol on one year research master degree would she support that my hon friend know that we have already look at that in careful detail it be keep under review and we recently make change to the teach course route of course student deserve high quality education at university they also deserve to be care for during what be for most of they their first time away from home do the secretary of state agree with and with the family of young people who have tragically take their own life at university that high education institution should do more to look out for and protect those student include by have statutory duty of care completely agree that be why the minister for skills apprenticeships and higher education my right hon friend the member for harlow robert halfon have ask all university to sign up to the mental health charter key stakeholder be the british taxpayer who end up pick up billion bill for people who can not pay back their student debt bricklayer roofer and carpenter there be not enough people in britain to do those job do the education secretary agree that we should promote those opportunity and route in our school system no one should turn up their nose at those job they offer good pathway to good wage and we should promote they my hon friend make very good point lot of people be surprise by how much they can earn in some of those trade whether welding bricklaying or plumbing there have be and there will always be fabulous apprenticeship and full time course to make sure everyone can reach those career the most important factor in determine graduate outcome remain the student socioeconomic background the average student from working class background go on to earn less after graduate than their wealthy peer with the same degree do the minister concede that the government insistence on degrade the value of degree and restrict access to high education will only compound those deep structural inequality that define our education system do the minister accept that many young people in my constituency will consider those plan an attempt to put they back in their place and out of university be in exactly the same place as the people in his constituency in fact in the same city so do not accept that at all we be upgrade the option for people from working class background and upgrade the quality of degree would not be here if have not have the option have which include an apprenticeship fe college and part time degree at liverpool john moores university that be high quality everybody who put their trust in the system should get the same support my right hon friend comment on the ucu mark ban which be so hurtful to student the late ucas datum show record number of year old from the most disadvantaged area accept on to course and that the entry rate gap between the most advantaged and disadvantaged area now stand at record low that be great but there be more work to be do will my right hon friend continue to focus on close that gap my hon friend be absolutely right we be continue to close that gap and we have make unbelievable progress more in the last year than ever in this country we will continue to make sure that work class people get access to all high quality route into the workplace the government should address the reason why some course be struggle not the consequence high education funding be in crisis and that be have an impact on the function of university not least the university will the review by the office for student look at the high education funding model how will it address the real symptom that she be talk about the hon lady make an interesting point but at the moment the ofs have provider under investigation for poor quality there be many more provider and we have standard fee it will look at contextual aspect such as demographic socioeconomic and mature student it look at all that in context but there be provider out of much large number the secretary of state have my full support for the measure she have announce this afternoon on that key mission of ensure that student pay fair price and get good return for their university education do she agree that more institution should follow the example of the university of buckingham which offer fantastic two year undergraduate degree with staggered start point throughout the year yes the university of buckingham have take an excellent leadership position and its two year degree be very much welcome by many people we will introduce the lifelong loan entitlement which will revolutionise how and when people go to university what type of course they take for what period of time and how they make those decision over their entire career and lifetime many of my constituent study or have obtain degree from harper adams university just up the road those degree be at the cutting edge of agriculture and the key challenge face all of we which be how to feed the planet in sustainable way their degree and the likely career they go into be classify by the office for national statistics as unprofessional will the secretary of state consider review the datum and take really hard look at how those occupation be classified because some of my constituent would miss out on really important opportunity to do high class and important degree thank the hon lady harper adams university be fantastic university it do fantastic range of course more and more look at agri tech the technology within agriculture be sure it offer fantastic high quality to its student there have be discussion about the profession and how the data be organise so will look at that number have raise that concern not just those in agriculture it seem absolutely right to that those who choose to go to university should expect good quality good value education they can put to good use throughout their life my right hon friend mention apprenticeship will she say little more about what we can do to ensure parity of esteem between degree and apprenticeship route thank my hon friend for all her support and know she be keen proponent of apprenticeship in her area lot of it be now about awareness the apprenticeship be fantastic know year ago that they be fantastic but think now everybody know how fantastic they be through put they on ucas and from next year have people able to apply through ucas we will also have centralised site so that all the apprenticeship be together and people can look at the vast array of career they can different route into pretty much every career you can think of it be about awareness thank all my hon friend who have apprenticeship fair and do lot to make people aware of these fantastic choice thank the secretary of state for her statement outline that university course which fail to deliver good outcome with high dropout rate and poor employment prospect will be subject to strict control that be great news for family who struggle to pay the money for course which end up with no benefit what discussion have she have with the university in northern ireland queen university belfast and ulster university will she confirm that this approach will be uk wide and that the postal and trade sea border will not extend to an education sea border think the hon gentleman know that this policy be devolve but work very closely with my ministerial counterpart in all devolve nation we share information and good practice and there be collaborative discussion too will make sure share this with they as well whole heartedly support what the secretary of state say today do she agree that degree should provide value for money and lead to well employment prospect and career development as thankfully happen with my study politic at nottingham trent university not just certificate and debt as develop under the previous labour administration who introduce fee and then do their good to devalue they my hon friend be right labour have flip flop on fee with several different policy in that area we be fully commit to build up our university high education sector and we continue to do that it be admire across the world but it be most important that every degree be quality degree that lead to good outcome the secretary of state be right the labour party have not just flip flop on its position on tuition fee but be now come across as not want parent and young people to have the good possible information about their option be work with the think tank policy exchange on reform the apprenticeship levy as it have identify if the public sector apprenticeship target of be meet in all area we could create additional apprenticeship will my right hon friend look at that and at whether we can change the procurement contract rule because we will need these new opportunity as we go forward as my hon friend know fully support give more and more people access to apprenticeship we be currently spend of the budget which do not leave much room for further flexibility over and above what we have already introduce the labour party policy of halve the apprenticeship levy will result only in few opportunity it be terrible policy and they should flip that policy because it be flop point of order on point of order mr speaker rise be your point of order on the same subject sir james indicate assent in that case will come to you after have hear the first one this evening committee be mean to discuss the draft postal packets miscellaneous amendments regulations which relate to part of the implementation of the windsor framework agreement the delegated legislation committee have already criticise the government for the way in which they have rush these regulation for the lack of information give and for their inability to answer the question that it have ask about the legislation today the government decide that half the conservative members on the committee who be select and approve by this house be to be remove because it be feel that they might be too critical and ask too many question be it in order for committee member who have be select by the house to be remove in this manner especially when that be design to stifle debate and when indeed one can only conclude that the government action would make the north korean leader blush at the lack of democratic process be not sure about that far to that point of order mr speaker be one of those who be throw off the committee have be ask by the house to join it and do the right thing in review the paperwork at the outset do not know that the draft postal packets miscellaneous amendments regulations be particularly controversial but when have do the research and find that they be tell my whip that have some concern all the consultation have come out against the legislation the democratic unionist party be concern about it and it do not deliver on brexit say that would probably want to probe and query it as be my right as member of parliament and perhaps even vote against it be ask whether would like to be replace say no be ask whether would like to take the week off say no this morning find that have be replace because the government have think that the sitting might continue for as long as minute and that that might be inconvenient for so they have find someone who could take the time then discover that other hon member be in the same position this will go on for the full minute we will make sure of that suspect that other member who be in the chamber will be present may ask you two question mr speaker first can time be find for we to debate this substantive issue which rid coach and horse through brexit on the floor of the house secondly have you receive any indication from ministers that they will not be introduce the statutory instrument at pm far to that point of order mr speaker do not want this to continue for too long do need to answer be sure the right hon gentleman will be brief will be brief mr speaker the member of the committee be nominate by the committee of selection in the normal way last week so far so good but when check with the chairman of the committee of selection learn that he have not be inform of the change which have be make by the whips and not by the committee this be basically sixth form politic stunt which come about because the government fear that the people concern would vote against that element of the windsor framework why have our government be reduce to this rise be now go to bring in gavin robinson but think we all know the answer by the way far to that point of order mr speaker clearly the purpose of delegated legislation committee be to fast track matter that contain no controversy and this exchange alone would suggest that there be issue worthy of exploration we have hear the suggestion that the committee would sit for minute but we know that within two hour the chamber will be incredibly busy with divisions there be no practical or reasonable prospect of the committee deal substantively with these issue affect the windsor framework should appreciate it sir if you could deal with that in your response rise finally call mr wragg far to that point of order mr speaker could you confirm that any member be entitle to go along to delegated legislation committee to speak you have answer it think all those who raise the point of order know the real answer without go into it be grateful to at least two of they for give notice although accept that it can cause inconvenience can confirm that late change to the membership of delegated legislation committees can be make in the way that have be describe in any case any member of the house whether nominated or not may attend and speak at any meeting of delegated legislation committee that may help but the member concern do not need to give the answer they will know or can think about the reason why they be not on the committee the answer to the two question from the hon member for rochford and southend east sir james duddridge be no and no on point of order mr speaker hope this be slightly less controversial so do feel be let people down when it come to drama mr speaker have you have any notice from the government of any intended statement either write or speak about the future of the regulation of buy now pay later lender some million people in this country be struggle to pay buy now pay later bill because they be borrow to fund the effect of inflation and the cost of living crisis they have no protection from the financial ombudsman in the government agree to legislate on the matter and we have be wait since then for regulation yet now there be press report not report to this house suggest that the whole thing be go to be scrap and rethought leave million of people open to harm from illegal loan shark what notice have you have of the matter mr speaker have not have any such indication from the government be sure that the hon lady point will have be note on the government benches hope they will be take on board let we see where we go from there illegal migration bill consideration of lords message clause introduction beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment and with this it will be convenient to discuss lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree amendment and and government motion to insist and lords amendment and and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and and government motion to disagree last tuesday this house vote time more time than on any other day on any other piece of legislation and time it vote to support this bill will the minister give way will first make few opening remark this house send back to the house of lords its amendment to the bill many of which simply drive coach and horse through the fabric of the legislation we bring forward reasonable amendment where it be sensible to do so and it be disappointing to say the least the some of those have be reject welcome the fact that the issue that we debate last week have now be whittle down to nine but the issue now before we be whether the clearly express view of this house the elect chamber not just in the vote last week but throughout the early passage of the bill should prevail we believe that inaction be not an option that we must stop the boat and that the bill be key part of our plan to do just that the message and the mean must be absolutely clear and unambiguous if people come to the uk illegally they will not be able to stay here instead they will be detain and return to their home country or remove to safe third country there be simply no point in pass legislation that do not deliver credible deterrent or provide the mean to back it up with effective and swift enforcement power we can not accept amendment that provide for exception qualification and loophole that would simply perpetuate the current cycle of delay and endless late and repeat legal challenge to removal listen carefully to the debate in the other place but no new argument be forthcoming and certainly no credible alternative be provide thoroughly endorse what my right hon friend say this be matter of extreme national interest as be reflect in the vote of constituent throughout the country they feel very strongly about these matter do he not agree that it be time for their lordship to take note of the fact that the british people want this legislation to go through they want progress give the extreme difficulty this be present to the british people strongly endorse my hon friend comment this be an issue of the high importance to the people we serve in this place of course there be legitimate role for the other place in scrutinise legislation but now be the time to move forward and pass this law to enable we to stop the boat wonder whether my right hon friend have note the remark of lord clarke who be not particularly vicious right wing creature he say this bill be entirely necessary and that we have to get on with it also wonder whether my right hon friend have look at today remark by lord heseltine lord clarke and lord heseltine seem to have come up with sensible option we should go ahead with this bill we have to have much well european co operation and really we have to build wall around europe interruption and we have to do much more this be what the opposition might like in term of marshall plan to try to remove the condition of sheer misery that cause people to want to leave these country in the first place read the remark of the noble lord clarke and entirely agree with his point which be that have listen to the totality of the debate in the house of lords he have not hear single credible alternative to the government plan for that reason alone it be important to support the government also agree with lord clarke broad point that this policy should not be the totality of our response to this challenge deterrence be an essential part of the plan but we also need to work closely with our partner in europe and far upstream one initiative that the prime minister the home secretary and have seek to pursue in recent month be to ensure that the united kingdom be strategic partner to each and every country that share our determination to tackle this issue from turkey and tunisia to france and belgium completely agree with my right hon friend believe that the bill should go through as we have to do something about the death in the channel which be an important moral purpose bring my right hon friend back to lord randall amendment on modern slavery we agree quite lot on this issue and the government have say that they will do stuff in guidance so lord randall have take the word speak by my right hon friend at the dispatch box and put they on the face of the bill this amendment do exactly what my right hon friend promise the government would do in guidance the government have not issue the guidance in detail which be why the amendment be make why would we vote against the amendment today when my right hon friend word and prescription be now on the face of the bill first the lords amendment on modern slavery go far by make the scheme as we see it much more difficult to establish there be number of reason but in particular we think the complexity of the issue require it to be provide for in statutory guidance rather than on the face of the bill in line with my assurance make on the floor of the house one of those assurance be particularly challenging to put in statutory guidance where an incident have take place in the united kingdom rather than an individual be traffic here and that be the point lord randall helpfully try to bring forward we be clear that the process have set out should be set out in statutory guidance because the wording of the amendment be open to abuse by those look to exploit loophole those arrive in small boat would seek to argue that they have be traffic into the uk and that the day grace period should apply to they on the basis that they qualify as soon as they reach uk territorial water the propose provision be for that reason operationally impossible and serve only to create another loophole that would render the swift removal we seek impossible or impractical the statutory guidance can well describe and qualify this commitment by make it clear that the exploitation must have occur once the person have spend period of time within the uk and not immediately they get off the small boat in kent for that reason we consider it well to place this on statutory footing as guidance rather than put it in the bill the democratic unionist party be concerned about the trafficking of child and young people my question be simple one we see economic migrant who be fit and healthy but none the less make that journey and we see those who have have to leave their country because they have be persecute discriminate against or be subject to brutal violence or because their family member have be murder my party and want to be assure that those who flee persecution have protection within this law because we do not see that they do we believe that they do because at the heart of this scheme be the principle that if an individual come to the uk illegally on small boat they will be remove back home if it be safe to do that if they be go to safe home country such as albania in determine that the country be safe for example as in the case of albania we would have seek specific assurance from it if require alternatively they will be remove to safe third country such as rwanda where again we would have seek sufficient assurance that an individual would be well treat there as the hon gentleman can see in the court at the moment those assurance will be test so it be not the intention of the uk government to expose any genuine victim of persecution to difficulty by remove they either back home and in the process enable their refoulement or to country in which they would be unsafe we want to establish significant deterrent to stop people come here in the first place bear in mind that the overwhelming majority of the individual we be talk about who would be catch by the bill be already in place of safety they be in france which be clearly safe country that have fully function asylum system let take the right hon gentleman back to the criticism he be make of the other place because if the elect house be about to break international law it be entirely fitting that the other place should try to prevent that from happen the minister have stand at the dispatch box tell we that this bill be about deterrence whereas the home office own impact assessment have say the bill be novel and untested scheme and it be therefore uncertain what level of deterrence impact it will have as raft of child charity have point out once routine child detention be end in there be no proportional increase in child claim asylum so will he come clean and accept that this bill absolutely will have the effect even if it do not have the intention of mean that people try to escape persecution will not be able to come here because there be not sufficient safe and legal route be not sure exactly what the hon lady question be if it be about access to safe and legal route let be clear as have in numerous debate on this topic that since the uk have welcome more than individual here it be near to now for humanitarian purpose that be very large number the last statistic see show that we be behind only the united states canada and sweden on our global united nations manage safe and legal route and we be one of the world big country for resettlement scheme that be very proud record the great inhibitor today to the uk do more on safe and legal route be the number of people come across the channel illegally on small boat take up capacity in our asylum and immigration system she know that only too well because we have discuss on number of occasion one of the most concern symptom of this issue which be unaccompanied child who be have to stay in home office procure hotel near to her constituency because local authority do not have capacity to flow those individual into safe and loving foster care as quickly as we would wish that issue be exactly emblematic of the problem that we be try to fix if we can stop the small boat we can do more as country and be an even great force for good in the world will the minister set out how my constituent will be protect he be albanian and have be subject to modern slavery by gang from albania he have three bullet hole in his body and if he return perhaps those gang will give he more how will he be protect the exist arrangement that we have secure with albania incidentally albania be signatory to the european convention against traffic enable we to safely return somebody home to albania with specific assurance to prevent they be retrafficke to the united kingdom and to enable they to be support appropriately upon arrival on the broad issue of modern slavery the bill make number of important protection when we establish the scheme if they be party to law enforcement investigation their removal from the country will be stay we have say that we will bring forward statutory guidance give they day period ally to the period set out in ecat to come forward and work with law enforcement which be extendable if that enforcement activity go on for some time we would then only remove that person either back home to safe country such as albania or to country such as rwanda where we have put in place appropriate procedure to ensure that that government in turn look after they point the hon lady to the judgment in the court of appeal that make some criticism of the government approach but do not say that the arrangement in rwanda with respect to modern slave be inappropriate it support the government in that regard we will clearly put in place appropriate procedure to ensure that victim such as the one she refer to be properly support many opponent of the bill seem to support uncapped safe and legal route the reality of that would be that potentially over million people could get the ability to come here do the minister agree that those propose that should be open and honest about it and explain what the dramatic consequence would be for public service and community cohesion in this country completely agree anyone who feel that this country have sufficient resource to welcome significant further number of individual at the present time should look at the inbox of the minister for immigration it be full of email and letter from member of the public local authority and member of parliament on both side of the house complain that they do not want to see further dispersal accommodation and worry about gp surgery appointment pressure on local public service and further hotel understand all those concern which be why we need an honest debate about the issue that be why at the heart of the bill there be not only tough deterrent position for new illegal entrant but consultation on safe and legal route where we specifically ask local authority what be your true capacity if we bring forward far safe and legal route they will be root in capacity in local authority so that those individual be not destine to be in hotel for month or year but go straight to housing and support in local authority that must be the right way for we to live up to our international obligation rather than the present situation that all too often be performative here and then there be major problem down the road let reply to issue other than modern slavery in the amendment before we on the issue of detention we believe that necessary part of the scheme provide for in the bill be that there be strong power where those subject to removal be not detain the prospect of be able to effect removal be significantly reduce give the likelihood of person abscond especially towards the end of the process we have make change to the provision for pregnant woman which be pleased have be accept by the lords and unaccompanied child but it be necessary for the power to cover family group as to do otherwise would introduce gap hole in the scheme as adult migrant and the most disgusting people smuggler would seek to profit from migrant and look to co opt unaccompanied child to bogus family group to avoid detention that not only prevent the removal of the adult but present very real safeguarding risk to child on unaccompanied child we stand by the amendment agree by the house last week they provide clear differentiation between the arrangement for the detention of adult and those for the detention of unaccompanied child the amendment agree by this house provide for judicial oversight after eight day detention where that detention be for the purpose of removal on the standard of accommodation have be clear that unaccompanie child include those whose age be dispute will be detain only in age appropriate accommodation and that exist secondary legislation the detention centre rules set out important principle govern the standard of such accommodation last week some member ask whether unaccompanied child would also receive age appropriate care while in detention the answer to that be an emphatic yes the operating standard for immigration removal centre contain provision around the treatment of child include requirement on the education and play facility that must be provide for child thank my right hon friend for make it clear that if there be any doubt about the age of an unaccompanied child they will be treat as child also thank he for say that if child be detain it will be in an age appropriate centre however on the issue of what be age appropriate will just say that have look at the operating standard to which he refer it be an page document it have no mention of unaccompanied child it talk about who look after the lock and hinge and where the tool and the ladder be to be store but there be nothing about how we keep these child happy healthy and safe from harm point he instead to the guidance for child care home and ask he gently if we could update the rule on detention centre to make sure that they look more like the rule we have for safeguard child in care home my right hon friend make number of important point the guidance be very detailed but be sure that it would benefit from update therefore the point that she have make and that other right hon and hon member have make in the past will be note by home office official as we operationalise this policy we will be careful to take those into consideration we be all united in our belief that those young people who be in our care need to be treat appropriately let turn now to the lords amendment on modern slavery hope that have answer the comment of my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith this seek to enshrine in the bill some of the assurance that provide in my remark last week in respect of people who be exploit in the uk however for the reason that have just describe we think that that be well do through statutory guidance in fact it would be impractical if not impossible to do it through the bill the point that my right hon friend make early be that somehow those people will be able to get into the uk and make false claim however the nationality and borders act already provide for that so anyone find to have make false claim will be disqualify and disqualify quite quickly the critical thing be to prosecute the trafficker that way we can stop they traffic more people on the boat my worry be that this provision will put off many people from give evidence and co operate with the police for fear that they may still be overridden and send abroad while they be do it and then be pick up by the trafficker do he give any credence to the fear that this may end up reduce the number of prosecution of trafficker as result understand my right hon friend position and it be right that he be vocalise it but we do not believe that what he say be likely the provision that we have make in the statutory guidance that have announce will give an individual day from the positive reasonable ground decision to confirm that they will co operate with an investigation in relation to their exploitation that should give they period of time to recover to come forward and to work with law enforcement that be period of time align with the provision of ecat so we rely on the decision of the drafter of ecat to choose day rather than another potentially long period that be an extendable period so where person continue to co operate with such an investigation they will continue to be entitle to the support and the protection of the national referral mechanism for long period just want to make it clear that under the new regulation the secretary of state can still feasibly decide that even if someone be co operate they do not need to remain in the uk for that that be the critical bit they live under the fear that they can be move somewhere else to give that evidence do the minister not agree that that will put lot of people off give evidence hope that that be not bear out it be worth remember that we will not remove anyone to country in which they would be endanger we would be remove that person either back to their home country if we consider it safe to do so usually because the country be an ecat signatory and have provision in place or to safe third country such as rwanda where once again we will have put in place significant provision to support the individual hope that that provide those individual with the confidence to come forward and work with law enforcement to bring the trafficker to book be particularly interested in the arrival of unaccompanied child in this country because obviously the minister have tighten up the eight day period for they on exit believe that he just agree with that the standard for age appropriate accommodation in detention centre need to be update to look more like those for child home be he prepared to concede that no unaccompanied child should be put in such detention centre until that update of the rule have be undertake understand the point that my right hon friend make but be not sure that that be necessary because the detention centre rules be very explicit in the high standard expect they set the overall standard and underlie they will no doubt be further guidance and support for individual who be work within the system if there be work to be do on the latter point we should do that and take account of her view and those of other who be expert in this field but the detention centre rules be very explicit in set high overarching standard for this form of accommodation that be exactly what we would seek to live up to in fact it would be unlawful if the government do not in child home we would expect there to be the right to access social worker and advocacy and for the child to have the care that they particularly need we would expect ofsted to oversee that not prison inspector be grateful for those point social worker will clearly be at the heart of all this work as they be today every setting in which young people be house by the home office whether it be an unaccompanied asylum seek child hotel which we mention early or another facility have strong contingent of qualified social worker who support those young people be certain that social worker will be at the heart of develop the policy and then in time operationalise it their lordship have attempt but fail to smooth the rough edge of their wreck amendment on legal proceeding but we need be in no doubt that they be still wreck amendment they would tie every removal up in knot and never end legal proceeding it be still the case that lords amendment would incorporate the various convention list in the amendment into our domestic law an amendment shoehorn into the bill be not the right place to make such significant constitutional change it be therefore right that we continue to reject it will the minister give way will not because need to close my remark this be short debate lord amendment continue to undermine core component of the bill that asylum and relevant human right claim be declare inadmissible the lords amendment would simply encourage illegal migrant to game the system and drag thing out for as long as possible in the hope that they would become eligible for asylum here lord amendment bring we back to the issue of the removal of lgbt people to certain country the government be strong defender of lgbt right across the globe there be no question of send national of one of the country list in the amendment back to their home country if they fear persecution base on their sexuality the bill be equally clear that if an lgbt person be to be issue with removal notice to country where they fear persecution on such ground or indeed on any other ground they could make serious harm suspensive claim and they would not be remove will the minister give way will not because need to bring my remark to close now they would not be remove until that claim and any appeal have be determine as say previously the concern underpin the amendment be misplace and the protection need be already in the bill on safe and legal route lords amendment bring we to the question of when new such route come into operation the amendment again seek to enshrine date in the bill itself have now say at the dispatch box on two occasion that we aim to implement any propose new route as soon as be practical and in any event by the end of have make that commitment on behalf of the government and that be the case there be simply no need for the amendment we should not delay the enactment of this bill over such non issue lords amendment table by the opposition relate to the national crime agency again it be non issue and the amendment be either performative or bear out of ignorance and lack of grasp of the detail the nca function already cover tackle organise immigration crime and man and woman in that service work day in day out to do just that there be no need to change the statute underlie the organisation finally we have lords amendment which be put forward by the archbishop of canterbury this country proud record of provide safe haven for more than half million people since be the great evidence that we need that the uk be already take lead international role in tackle the refugee crisis this government be work tirelessly with international and domestic partner to tackle human trafficking and continue to support overseas programme we will work with international partner and bring forward proposal for additional safe and legal route where necessary however well intentione this amendment remain unnecessary as say to his grace the archbishop if the church wish to play further role in resettlement it could join our community sponsorship scheme an ongoing and global safe and legal route that as far as be aware the church of england be not currently engage with this elect house vote to give the bill second and third reading last tuesday it vote no few than time in succession to reject the lords amendment and an time to endorse the government amendment in lieu relate to the detention of unaccompanied child it be time for the clear view of the elect house to prevail invite all right hon and hon member to stand with the government in uphold the will of the democratically elect commons to support the government motion and to get on with secure our border and stop the boat on tuesday describe the way in which this government have take sledgehammer to our asylum report july vol outline the massive and far reach cost and consequence of year of tory incompetence and indifference describe this big backlog bill as shambolic farce that will only compound the chaos that minister have create urge the government to accept the amendment propose by the other place and to adopt labour pragmatic realistic and workable five point plan to stop the boat and fix our broken asylum system set out how the bill unworkability centre on the fact that it order the home secretary to detain asylum seeker where there be nowhere to detain they it prevent she from process and return fail asylum seeker across the channel to their country of origin instead force she to return they to third country such as rwanda however rwanda can take only of those who come here on small boat last year the rwanda plan be neither credible nor workable because the tiny risk of be send to kigali will not deter those who have already risk life and limb to make dangerous journey across the continent yet here we be again today respond to the realisation that in their typically arrogant and tin eared fashion ministers be once again refuse to listen they be once again close their eye and ear to the reality of what be happen around they and choose to carry on drive the car straight into brick wall but we on the labour benches refuse to give up we shall continue in our attempt to persuade the government to come to their sens shall seek to do that today by set out why the argument that the immigration minister have make against the amendment from the other place be both fundamentally flawed and dangerously counterproductive if the principle of removal to safe third country be not an adequate deterrent why be that principle the flagship of the last labour government immigration policy in the nationality immigration and asylum act what be the point of section its most controversial provision if it be not about the swift removal of fail asylum seeker the crucial point be that for deterrent to be effective it have to be credible deterrent base on risk of be send to rwanda be completely and utterly incredible the only deterrent that work be comprehensive return deal with mainland europe if someone know that be they to come here on small boat they would be send back to mainland europe they will not come and they will not pay to the people smuggler the only way to get that deal be to have sensible and pragmatic negotiation with the european union base on quid pro quo give and take that be the fundamental reality of the situation in which we find ourselves but unfortunately those on the conservative benches keep close their ear to that reality be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way again will not take long do he not accept that in reality there be no such thing as return deal with mainland europe the reason the dublin convention be such disaster and never result in we remove more people than we take in be that it be so incredibly difficult to get european country to accept removal and make that happen it be just an unworkable suggestion surely the hon lady see the direct connection between we crash out of the dublin regulation because of the utterly botch brexit of the government she speak for and the number of small boat crossing start to skyrocket there be direct correlation between crash out of the dublin regulation and skyrocket small boat crossing hope that she will look at the datum and realise the truth of the matter we have have this conversation before the hon gentleman know that when we be cover by dublin before we come out of it through brexit there be more than request for people to be deport back to an eu country and only of those request or about be actually grant so there be not some golden era when it work under dublin it be not work then and it certainly will not work now the hon gentleman be right we have have this conversation before and he consistently refuse to listen to the fact that the dublin regulation act as deterrent so the number that he talk about be small the number of small boat crossing be small when we be part of the dublin regulation we leave the dublin regulation and now the number be large it be not rocket science there be clear connection correlation causal link between the two the hon gentleman be be very generous with his time the reason the small boat problem have grow exponentially be that we deal with the lorry issue we close the loophole when it come to lorry and the channel tunnel in particular and that be why people be now resort to small boat it be nothing to do with dublin surely those be the fact simply say to the right hon and learn gentleman that last year we have people come on small boat and goodness know how many on lorry of course those come by clandestine mean in the back of lorry be far more difficult to detect than those come on small boat so the small boat crisis be by definition far more visible it be true that that juxtaposition and the new arrangement have have positive impact but we still do not know how many be come have be to camp in calais and speak to many who be plan to come on lorry rather than on small boat not least because it be far cheap alternative the reality be that very large number of people be come to our country through irregular mean but it be also clear that that number be significantly small when we be part of the dublin regulation that be because it be comprehensive deterrent compare with the utterly insignificant power of the rwanda programme as deterrent will the hon member give way will make little bit of progress and then will allow the hon gentleman to intervene will turn first to lords amendment intend to ensure that the bill be consistent with international law which labour fully support last week the minister deem the same amendment unnecessary because it go without say that the government obey our international obligation as we do with all piece of legislation official report july vol that comment be typical of the minister approach he be constantly try to calm his colleague nerve by fob they off with that sort of soothe statement but we all know that he do not really believe word of it he know that the very first page of the bill state that the government be unable to confirm that it comply with our legal obligation he also know that the government be more than happy to break international law just look at how they play fast and loose with the northern ireland protocol if the minister really think that we will simply take his deeply misleading word at face value and trust he and his colleague to uphold our legal obligation he have another think come order think that the hon gentleman do not mean to use the phrase deeply misleading know that he be an honourable gentleman suggest that he might want to use slightly different misleading perhaps thank you madam deputy speaker would misleadingly soothe work it will do for the time be as always madam deputy speaker you be very gracious the late great denis healey famously advise that when you be in hole you should stop dig hon member quite right hang on he would certainly have approve of lords amendment which go right to the heart of the fundamental unworkability of this big backlog bill and seek to prevent it from become the indefinite limbo bill let we be clear the current state of affair represent both mental health crisis for asylum seeker and financial crisis for british taxpayer who be already shoulder an asylum bill that be seven time high than it be in at billion year indeed the mid range estimate for the hotel bill alone be great than the late round of level up funding and three time high than the entire budget for tackle homelessness in this country the only people who benefit from the inadmissibility provision in the bill be the people smuggler and human trafficker who be laugh all the way to the bank as such it be essential that this house vote in favour of lord german amendment which seek to ensure that inadmissibility can be apply to an asylum seeker only for period of six month if they have not be remove to another country major concern throughout the passage of the bill have be its utter disregard for the mental wellbeing of unaccompanied child many of those child will have have to see their love one suffer unspeakable act of violence yet despite the government concession the bill will mean that when they arrive in the uk they will be detain like criminal for up to eight day before they can apply for bail we be clear that that be unacceptable and be in no doubt that the government amendment be yet another example of their liking for performative cruelty we urge the minister to accept the compromise of hour contain in lords amendment and will the hon member give way sorry mean to let the hon gentleman in early thank the hon member for give way the good thing for any person mental health especially child be to not put they on dangerous small boat across the channel do the hon member agree that the good thing for any child mental health be for they to not make that dangerous journey but instead use one of the many legal and safe route this bill and its clause will make sure that few child make that awful journey the hon gentleman be absolutely right that the only people who benefit from the small boat crossing be the people smuggler and human trafficker that have to be bring to an end where we fundamentally disagree be about the mean labour believe that the deterrence of the rwanda scheme simply will not work for the reason have already set out and that the solution lie far more in pragmatism and quiet diplomacy work with international partner to get the return deal that talk about than in all the performative cruelty that be at the heart of this bill likewise the government should show some humility and support lords amendment which state that accompany child should be liable for detention only for up to hour this be fair and reasonable compromise give that lords amendment initially set the limit at hour while we be on the subject of child how utterly astonishing and deeply depress it be to hear the minister stand at the dispatch box last week and justify the erasure of disney cartoon on the basis of their not be age appropriate quite apart from the fact that his nasty bully performative cruelty will have absolutely no effect whatsoever in stop the boat it have since emerge that more than of the child who pass through that building in the year to march be under the age of give that significant proportion of those would have be young still just wonder whether the minister would like to take this opportunity to withdraw his comment about the age appropriateness of those cartoon indicate dissent no well there we have it this whole sorry episode really be new low for this minister and for the shameful callous government he represent we also support lords amendment compromise in lieu of lords amendment which seek to protect lgbt asylum seeker from be remove to country that persecute they for their sexuality or gender the minister last week claim that that be unnecessary because there be an appeal process but why on earth would he put asylum seeker and the british taxpayer through an expensive and time consume appeal process when he could just rule out this scenario from the outset nothing illustrate more clearly the indifference of this government towards the most vulnerable people in society than their treatment of woman be traffic into our country for prostitution have already describe this bill as trafficker charter gift to the slave driver and the pimp because it make it hard for victim to come forward and therefore more difficult for the police to prosecute criminal the immigration minister last week repeat the false claim that the uk statistics authority recently rebuke he for it be his second rebuke this year by our national statistic watchdog for inaccurate claim make to this house thankfully the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may who be not in her place today call he out on it she correctly point out that the proportion of small boat migrant claim to be victim of modern slavery stand at just this be profoundly embarrassing moment for the minister but do hope he will now swallow his pride listen to the wise counsel he be receive from those on the benches behind he and accept lords amendment in the name of lord randall the hon member be right that misspoke when cite those statistic on an early occasion but in fact the statistic be bad than say to the house what say be that of foreign national offender who be in the detain estate on the eve of their departure over make use of modern slavery legislation to put in last minute claim and delay their removal however it be not just fno it be also small boat arrival so the point be make be even more pertinent and it be one that he should try to answer what would he do to stop of people in the detain estate who we be try to get out of the country put in frivolous claim at the last minute sir robert chote of the uk statistics authority say clearly that the figure be only not do not know whether we want to invite sir robert to clarify those point himself but the rebuke the minister receive from the uk statistics authority be pretty clear it be vitally important that the minister position on this be not use as the basis for policy that could cause profound harm to vulnerable woman while feed criminality in the united kingdom therefore urge he to reflect on what he be try to achieve the proportionality of his action and the unintended consequence he may be facilitate lords amendment state that victim of trafficking who have be unlawfully exploit in the uk should be protect from the automatic duty to remove and should continue to be able to access the support currently available to they but only for the duration of the statutory recovery period which be set by the nationality and borders act at day on second reading the right hon member for maidenhead argue that the bill as draft would drive coach and horse through the modern slavery act deny support to those who have be exploit and enslave and in do so make it much hard to catch and stop the trafficker and slave driver official report march vol we strongly agree with her concern and wholeheartedly support lords amendment which remind the minister go no far than to maintain the status quo of the basic protection and support currently available to all victim of trafficking and exportation will now turn to the amendment that be underpin by labour five point plan end the dangerous small boat crossing defeat the criminal gang clear the backlog end extortionate hotel use and fix the asylum system that the conservatives have spend year destroy presumably it be the hon gentleman most devout hope if he take power in month time but charming as he be it be mystery to why he think when he ask president macron to take these people back he will do so of course he will nothing will happen may gently suggest that if there be labour government they will quietly adopt this bill once it be an act will come to that in my comment but as the right hon gentleman will know any negotiation require give and take quid pro quo as say in response to one of his hon friend to get that deal with the european union we of course have to do our bit and take our fair share and that will be the negotiation that my right hon and learn friend the member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer will be lead on when he become prime minister of the united kingdom follow the next general election we be determined that the national crime agency will be strengthen so that it can tackle the criminal gang upstream too much focus by this government have be on slash tent and puncture dinghy along the french coastline whereas labour have set out its plan for an elite unit in the nca to work directly with europol and interpol the late amendment from lord coaker lords amendment attempt to strengthen the nca authority and we support it without reservation we be also clear that there be direct link between gain the return agreement that we desperately need with the eu and create control and manage pathway to asylum which would allow genuine refugee to reach the uk safely particularly if they have family here conservative member refuse to make that connection but we know it be in the interest of the eu and france to strike return deal with the uk and dissuade the ten of thousand of asylum seeker who be flow through europe and end up on the beach of calais the eu and its member state will never do deal with the uk unless it be base on give and take arrangement whereby every country involve do its bit and share responsibility on his visit to calais the hon gentleman will have meet people who be try to get to this country do it strike he how utterly desperate many of they be and how they be flee from war in afghanistan libya iraq and other place do he think that we have to address the wide issue of the reason why people be flee and search for asylum not just in europe but all over the world thank the right hon gentleman as he rightly point out the key point be that these people be already flee desperate situation and have risk life and limb to get as far as they have the idea that chance of be send to rwanda act as deterrent be clearly for the bird in addition he make important point about the need for international co operation and find solution to these problem alongside our partner across the channel the hon gentleman clearly think that the rwanda plan will not work or be deterrent but why not give it go if he be so confident that it will not work let it get through it could have get through month ago and he could have come back to the house and prove we wrong at the moment it come across as if the hon gentleman and the labour party be scared that it might work and that be the problem suppose the answer to the hon gentleman question be that if it walk like duck and quack like duck it probably be duck and the rwanda plan be so clearly and utterly misconceive misconstrue and counter productive labour member like to vote for thing that be actually go to work which be why we simply can not support that hare brain scheme with the minister last week reiterate deadline of december month from now to lay out what safe and legal route might look like and by state that those route will not deal with the challenge face europe directly he appear to be reduce the chance of get the return deal with the eu that we so urgently need let we not forget that this government send britain tumble out of the dublin regulation during their botch brexit negotiation and it be no surprise that small boat crossing have skyrocket since then this government must prioritise get that return deal we therefore support lords amendment which demand that the government get on with set out what these safe and legal route might look like not only to provide control and capped pathway to sanctuary for genuine refugee but to break that deadlock in the negotiation with the eu over return note that the minister love to trot out his line about the ukraine hong kong and afghan resettlement scheme but he neglect to mention that there be now thousand of homeless ukrainian family and we have the travesty of thousand of loyal to britain afghans who be set to be throw on the street at the end of august more than afghans be stick in pakistan with the right to come here but they be not be allow to do so he simply must fix those resettlement scheme be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way because this be an important point that all member of the house should appreciate the no reason why we be struggle to bring to the uk those people in pakistan we would like to bring they here because we have moral and historical obligation to they be that illegal immigrant on small boat have take all the capacity of local authority to house they if the hon gentleman truly want to support those people he would back this bill he would stop the boat and then he would help we to bring those much need people into the united kingdom it beggar belief that the immigration minister say that when he speak for party that have allow our backlog to get to cost million day in hotel he should just get the processing system sort out the conservatives downgrade the seniority of caseworker and decision maker in and surprise surprise productivity fall off cliff as do the quality of decision that be the fundamental problem but we have to recognise that these afghans have stand shoulder to shoulder with our defence diplomacy and development effort in afghanistan and we owe they debt of honour and gratitude do the hon gentleman know how many asylum seeker be house in his constituency or would he like to tell he it be none there be no asylum seeker accommodate in aberavon if he would like we to bring in more people whether on safe and legal route or on scheme such as the afghan relocation and assistance policy he should get on the phone to his local council and the welsh government this afternoon the minister be talk absolute nonsense be proud of the fact we have many syrians in our constituency we have ukrainians in our welcome centre discussion be ongoing between the home office and the welsh government the incompetence of his government mean that they be not manage to house they wales be ready to have that dialogue with the home office find it shocking admission from the minister we be fight for the relative of people in afghanistan whose life be at risk that these afghans be be block by he because he be not make available those safe route to bring they to constituency such as york where we welcome refugee completely agree with my hon friend there be real concern about the safety and security of those afghans now in pakistan it be possible that they will be send back it be up to the home office to facilitate their transfer to the united kingdom under arap and the afghan citizen resettlement scheme but like so many thing with this home office it be just catastrophic failure of management in trot out the line about the scheme that mention the minister conveniently ignore the fact that none of those scheme help those come from other high grant rate country in the middle east and sub saharan africa neither he nor the home secretary have be able to answer question from their own back benchers on that precise point the final point of our plan be to tackle migration flow close to the conflict zone where they arise through target our aid spending that be long term mission but it be no less important than any of the other step we need to take to meet these migration challenge therefore see no reason for the government not to support lords amendment in the name of the archbishop of canterbury which would instruct the government to develop year plan to manage migration have lose count of the number of time we have come to the chamber to debate the government late madcap bill or hare brain scheme not one of those bills have help to stop single boat and the government have send more home secretaries to rwanda than they have asylum seeker they be waste their own time and the time of the house and they really be try the patience of the british people it really be desperate stuff and it have to stop in stark contrast to the hopeless aimless and utterly self defeat thrashing around that have come to define the government approach to the asylum crisis labour recognise that there be way through route base on hard graft common sense and quiet diplomacy it come in the form of the labour party comprehensive plan base on core principle with commitment to return asylum processing to the well manage efficient smooth run system we have prior to the catastrophic change bring in by conservative ministers in which downgrade decision maker and caseworker lead to poor result with that we have commitment to go far in fast track application from low grant rate country so that we can return those with no right to be here and fast track application from high grant rate country so that genuine refugee can get on with their life and start contribute to our economy enrich our society and culture third key principle be the need for international co operation as have set out this be not rocket science it be just sensible pragmatic serious governance it be work in the united states where the biden administration be win the battle they have introduce combination of swift consequence for those who cross the border illegally orderly path and control on which migrant can apply for asylum and where they do so sensible legal pathway for high grant rate nation and strong co operation with mexico the result be that they be bring number down significantly and quickly the challenge be not over yet and we would not see president biden be foolish enough to go boast at the border but that show that progress can be make the labour party be not interested in performative cruelty chase headline or government by gimmick we have plan that will stop the boat fix our broken asylum system and deliver for the british people in contrast the conservative party have run out of idea and run out of road it should get out of the way so that we can get to work rise we have only one hour leave for the remainder of the debate so have to impose an immediate time limit be go to say six minute but will have to say five minute thank you madam deputy speaker it be always an experience to follow the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock it be once say that someone who have just meet his father have just spend half an hour have five minute conversation with he we have just have half hour speech but be afraid that we do not get five minute of anything remotely new in that on point of order madam deputy speaker be it in order to raise my father and what he might or might not have say when he be not in the chamber to defend himself it would be well not to do so there be no hard and fast rule since the right hon and noble gentlemen be no long member of this chamber will happily withdraw that madam deputy speaker if can have my minute back declare an interest as the chairman of safeguarding board of child company be rather surprised to read in paper over the weekend that accord to the briefing my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may and be some sort of ringleader against the bill may make it absolutely clear that support the bill and want it to go through as quickly as possible and that support the rwanda scheme object to some of the bill traffic measure be about protect victim and prosecute trafficker not undermine the bill great safeguard on how we look after child who have arrive here would not undermine the bill they would strengthen it safeguard to ensure that safe and legal route be in place for genuine asylum seeker would not undermine the bill they would strengthen and justify the measure against those who be game the system to whom we do not have duty of care in my limited time want to concentrate on the amendment table by baroness mobarik also thank baroness stroud and lord randall for the amendment on traffic and safe and legal route the fact be that the government amendment to clause will give child on their own in the uk the chance to apply to be bail from detention after eight day but that will apply only if they be detain to be remove to be unite with family or to be return to their home country that will not apply to all unaccompanied child when they first arrive in the uk it will impact on only small group of child other separated child not subject to removal will be detain for at least day and there be still no statutory limit on detention for any separated child under the government proposal separate child affect by the bill can still be indefinitely detain that be the truth of the matter it be imperative to include time limit on child detention in the bill if the government intend to detain child for the short possible time they can reinforce that message by enshrine time limit in the primary legislation as we have ask for all along although the minister have give some concession we be still not there the government still do not explain what would constitute an age appropriate detention facility at the same time they have introduce broad new power to allow the home secretary to designate place as an immigration detention centre it be worry to read that the government be still unclear on the status of separated child who be detain and claim that they will not require support from local authority under the children act those child should therefore have access to support and right afford under the act it be concern to see the effective creation of two tier system where group of child might be deny protection just because of their immigration status and mode of arrival despite the fact that they be all entitle to protection under the children act the minister have say that he want to detain child for the short possible time agree so any codifying of that would surely be beneficial win we need reassurance on the type of detain accommodation accommodation that meet child home standard and be subject to the same sort of inspection as child home miss the minister friendly chat over the weekend which have enjoy for the past few weekend be not sure why be miss out he do however send round some clarify point but they do not clarify the still too many outstanding question he have say where there be no dispute that someone be under they will be transfer to the local authority accommodation estate as quickly as possible how quick where do it say that he have also say where there be doubt about whether person be indeed under as they claim to be they will be treat as child while an age assessment be undertake where how he have say such person will be detain in age appropriate accommodation as the law already provide where will that happen he have also say if no such accommodation be available they will not be detain and instead will be transfer to local authority as soon as possible official report july vol good where do it say that in the legislation that be problem the minister have quote various inspection report of yarl wood go back to in defence of what the government be try to do that inspection report say the plight of detain child remain of great concern an immigration removal centre can never be suitable place for child and we be dismay to find case of disabled child be detain and some child spend large amount of time incarcerate any period of detention can be detrimental to child and their family but the impact of lengthy detention be particularly extreme it also say that centre be bright and well decorate that on the last visit clearly some cartoon be still on the wall there the problem be that there have be concession but there be still too many unanswered question we need those extra assurance call the scottish national party spokesperson we should oppose all nine government motion which be precisely what my snp colleague and will do this evening let say again that this bill be so appalling that the house of lords should stop it in its track however baroness jones be the one speaker who have the gut to say we should be stubborn about not allow the bill to go through official report house of lords july vol as ask last week if the lords will not consider halt this bill which bill will it be this bill be about lock up kid force trafficking victim back to their exploiter mass detention closure of the uk asylum system and the trashing of international law if the lords will not use their power to block this bill bill that also run totally contrary to what be in the conservative manifesto what be the point of their power and what be the point of the house of lords let we hope that we can salvage something from these final proceeding on lords amendment if the bill be consistent with our international obligation the government can not have any objection to the amendment on the other hand if as the government have at other time argue it wreck the bill to have to be read consistently with international law then the problem be with the bill not the amendment that be good reason in itself for the whole bill to be stop in its track the revision to the amendment mean that argument about allegedly incorporate international law have be address despite the completely unsubstantiated assertion from the minister we have hear lot of strong word about protect dualist system of law but give that the government could not even make the normal human right compatibility statement we need strong action to protect fundamental human right and the rule of law the group amendment and be also important in uphold the rule of law they preserve judicial oversight so that illegal decision by the government can be properly challenge before they be implement it really be as simple and fundamental as that the government keep talk about loophole but access to court the rule of law and fundamental right be not loophole they be fundamental principle that we should be uphold lord amendment be another crucial amendment it now include safeguard to assuage the usual government concern about game the system but retain the vital protection that if person can not be remove to rwanda even after six month they will then have their case assess here it simply preserve the status quo and be an essential protection it remain an appalling prospect that people who be refugee will be leave in limbo forever by the government never allow to have their claim hear here and never able to contribute even if removal be near impossible prospect indeed it be also ludicrous that there will be people with totally unfounded claim for asylum who will get to remain here in limbo often at considerable taxpayer expense because of the bill the bill stop unfounded claim be deal with just as it stop well found claim be deal with the end result be that thousand of people will need to be detain and accommodate in perpetuity many more will disappear underground as they will have no reason to stay in touch with the home office it be the end of the uk contribution to the refugee convention again if the government be not willing to move on that their lordship should hold up the whole bill on mass and limitless detention of child in inappropriate accommodation of course we continue to support all effort to curtail the horrendous new power and to limit the extraordinary harm that we know and the home office know detention cause to they we therefore support lords amendment and as say last week the government amendment in lieu really represent pathetic non concession theoretical right for some kid detain for removal to seek bail after eight day be just not remotely acceptable at the very least we need short hard and fast limit and those limit should be automatic and not dependent on child be able to navigate the bail system and access the legal support that would be require to do that and the time limit should apply to all kid whether accompanied or not and regardless of which particular power they be detain under the government make claim about create incentive to play by the rule but as with most of their claim they offer absolutely no evidence there be no suggestion for example that the introduction of strict time limit by david cameron government have the impact suggest here it be just another myth as member on both side have say the bill be serious threat to victim of modern slavery and trafficking and yet again it totally ignore devolve power on this subject those be exploit be the one who will suffer not the trafficker whose power over their victim will only be enhance by the withdrawal of any route to safety for those they be exploit we therefore support lords amendment and anything that will undo some of the damage that the bill will do to modern slavery and traffic provision without the damage the bill will do to slavery and traffic law across the uk be yet again sufficient to justify hold up the whole bill on lords amendment and protection for lgbt people we fully support everything lord etherton say in support of his amendment put the fact that these country be not safe for lgbt people on the face of the schedule anything that build on the flimsy and almost certainly unworkable system of suspensive claim should be welcome lgbt people should not have to go through that process in the first place if the government be commit to safe legal route they should have no problem with lords amendment on the archbishop amendment and year strategy be utterly sensible indeed it be essential long term thinking be as necessary for issue surround force migration as other pivotal challenge such as climate change ultimately the amendment can only add little polish to an odious bill that be utterly beyond redemption it should be stop in its track entirely and any party that still send people to the relic of second chamber should be use their influence to see that that happen otherwise this be all just for show and very vulnerable people will suffer as result edmund burke say that what matter be not what lawyer tell may do but what humanity reason and justice tell ought to do in consider the government response to the lords amendment it be important to re emphasise that the bill be about fairness about affirm the integrity of our nation by defend our border from those who seek to arrive here illegally we must have the power to remove those entrant from our country to do so be just and fair it be what the british people expect what they vote for in and what they choose in the brexit referendum consider the argument make in the other place be strike by the absence of credible alternative to the government proposal there seem little sense there of the need to control our border stop the boat save life and to make our immigration system fair more reasonable and more just sadly much of the debate on the amendment in the other place have be characterise by combination of denial and detachment from the popular will denial about the urgency of the problem and detachment from the sentiment express by my constituent and the constituent of other member on both side of this chamber those arrive in small boat must be detain securely and remove swiftly and it must be straightforward process for only through that process will we deter more people from arrive will the right hon gentleman give way will not because of the time apologise to the hon and learn lady as the minister have make clear the government response to lords amendment and be root in the understanding that those amendment be unnecessary the government take our international obligation very seriously indeed all three appeal court judge agree that the government commitment be in tune with and compatible with international law as for the motion to disagree with lords amendment we must keep this matter in perspective there be no evidence whatsoever that the vast majority of people come to this country in small boat or indeed significant number of they be seek shelter from persecution because of their sexuality and it be distortion to pretend otherwise in respect of the motion to disagree with lords amendment this business of safe and legal route be again distraction and detachment from the urgency of this problem the amendment be unnecessary and seem to constitute legislative grandstanding for under section of the crime and courts act the function of the national crime agency already extend to combat all type of organise crime include organise immigration crime finally let deal with the motion to disagree with lords amendment and which propose the archbishop of canterbury ten year strategy approve of have the lords spiritual in the other place they be otherworldly the lord bishops understandably take view about an infinite eternal future however those of we who be elect and answerable to the people directly have to deal with this world here and now and in this world people demand that we control our border and they do so justly and reasonably will the right hon gentleman give way will not give way because wish to finish promptly as you would expect to do mr deputy speaker the great tory prime minister benjamin disraeli say the secret of success be constancy to purpose this minister and the home secretary have be constant in their purpose of control our border let we have less sanctimony and more common sense less self righteousness and more selfless commitment to the people will less soul search and more heartfelt advocacy of the interest of hard work law abide decent patriotic britons who support this bill and oppose the lords amendment regard the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes as friend in the true sense of the word but say that it be pleasure to follow he this evening not least because it mean that he have stop talk there be real sense of déjà vu about this debate and not just because of the proceeding in relation to this bill we have hear all these argument before almost word for word everything that the minister say at the dispatch box this afternoon have be hear in relation to what be now the nationality and borders act and what progress have be make as consequence of that none follow closely your exchange with the shadow immigration minister madam deputy speaker in relation to the question of the minister be misleading should say that do not think for one second that the minister be in any way misleading can not speak for his intention of course only he know about that but certainly be not mislead to any reasonable minded person it must surely be obvious what the government be about today look at the broad context net migration figure be go up and up and today there have be an announcement that construction worker be to be add to the shortage occupation list something that run contrary to virtually every piece of rhetoric that we have hear from government back benchers and the treasury bench what we have here be piece of double down at the expense of some of the most vulnerable people in the world the minister speak about late and repeat challenge well to have late or repeat challenge there would have to be some decision first there must be decision before it can be challenge as of march there be application outstanding in the system this government have fail to manage migration whether asylum or the economic migration that our economy so desperately need that be why we be here today this be nakedly political attempt to deflect attention away from the failure to deal with our system properly it be unfortunate that the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith be not here he make the point perfectly that the modern slavery amendment under consideration today would simply put the minister own word into force in the bill when conservative be in opposition they use to shout about that all the time they seem to have lose their appetite for it in recent time the comment of the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton about the detention of child be absolutely on point we all see for ourselves certainly do the human consequence and harsh reality of the detention of child when that be part of our immigration system it beggar belief that we should be return to that the question of safe and legal route be again classic example of the government say to we that we can have jam tomorrow but not today how be it that the high politic have to be in the bill but the actual practical workable solution which will to borrow the minister three word slogan actually stop the boat be somehow too difficult they always have to be leave not because they be practically or administratively too difficult but because they do not fit the unpleasant political rhetoric and narrative on which the government rely to speak to base that frankly should be confront and not appease that be why my party will vote against the government motion to disagree and we urge their lordship to stick to their gun the minister can relax be not go to bang on about raf scampton not least because have put in for the adjournment debate on thursday when can deal with it in more detail just ask the house to accept that my constituent be more than any other in the country victim of this farce this debacle of try to house people in one place that be not good for the people and it will overwhelm our social service there be now an argument to be have about the future of the house of lords there be no point in our have these endless debate about whether it should be elect or not it should be proper revise chamber when it be give bill such as this its attitude should be how can we improve it how can we make it work well how can we remove these legal glitch which will have unintended consequence it seem to that so much of the debate in the house of lords and so many of the amendment have just be design to drive coach and horse through the bill and to give human right lawyer even great chance to develop ever more legal argument to stop anybody from be deport have some sympathy with what the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael say what be bit of mystery to be that we go through this whole process last year we have the ping pong on the nationality and borders bill we get it through parliament and be tell that it would solve the problem but we still have the same problem prophesise that actually this bill will become law the labour party do not want to set precedent for the unelected house of lords to block legislation so it will give in and the house of lords will deliver the bill it will become an act of parliament and have horrible feeling that this time next year we will be in exactly the same position can we rely on the supreme court to agree that people should be deport to rwanda what be we go to do be it cruell to detain people as soon as they arrive or to do nothing and have tragedy in the channel be it cruel to continue let people smuggler get away with what they want of course have enormous sympathy with what my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton say about child but the trouble be that so many of these people who claim to be child be not child they have to be assess one of the problem we face at scampton be that there be so many of these people of the population come into the camp which mean there will have to be an army of social worker to determine whether they be child have enormous sympathy for persecuted lgbt people but the truth be that the moment we create an exception say that we can not deport person to an african country with dodgy record on lgbt everyone will claim to be lgbt of course they will would do the same if be come from iraq would say be christian if be come from syria would say be gay this be the problem we face every time we try to do anything human right lawyer drive coach and horse through all our effort so what be we go to do have say for two or three year now that the only solution suspect the government will be drag into this within year be to have derogation if necessary temporary derogation during national crisis from the refugee convention which prevent we from detain people who claim to be asylum seeker we will also have to have derogation from the european convention on human right be member of the council of europe and value the work of the council of europe but the european court of human rights be not supreme court like our supreme court it be not supreme court like the american supreme court it be fundamentally political body appoint on political ground until we have freedom of manoeuvre to have real deterrent that tell the world if you land illegally on our shore you will be detain and ultimately you will either have to go back where you come from or be deport we will never stop this problem it be all right for the labour party to talk about safe and legal route and about what it will try to do but we all know that that do not work for the dublin convention and it will not work if labour take power president macron will not suddenly change his mind he will not take anyone back we will be in this exact position in month time if there be labour government and predict that if there be labour government they will simply leave this act on the statute book pretty well unamended my constituency be victim of all this so what be the house go to do this be utterly debilitate we can not go on like this please can we have plan it be sadly not pleasure to follow the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh talk about leave or have derogation from human right law be exactly what be wrong with the government approach to this issue and what be wrong with this vile bill with overwhelming support from across the political spectrum and back by conservative peer and by religious leader include the archbishop of canterbury the other place be absolutely right to have inflict string of defeat on this vile illegal bill lord amendment in the name of baroness chakrabarti should be easy for any decent government to accept because it simply ask for compliance with the rule of law which be the bedrock of our democracy but the government be attack that foundation force to admit on the face of this immoral bill that they be unable to say it be compatible with the european convention on human right by move motion to disagree to lords amendment the government be seek to deny uk judge the right to interpret this law and to check it against compliance with the uk obligation under no few than five international convention that we should be defend not undermine the minister in the other place try to argue that previous version of this amendment be try to incorporate international law into domestic law and that in do so it be an unacceptable change to our legal framework do not think that that be what the previous version do but for the avoidance of doubt in this version lords amendment be explicit in call for the interpretation of international law to ensure compliance with our international obligation indeed ministers will be aware of the contribution from lord hope who serve as deputy president of the supreme court and last week say that this amendment be pure interpretation provision entirely consistent with the way the court approach these various be entirely orthodox and consistent with principle official report house of lords july vol adhere to the refugee convention the european convention on human right and other international law we have sign up to should be non negotiable what terrible state of affair it be that the government want to vote down an amendment seek compliance with the rule of law the government argument be that strip vulnerable people of asylum and other human right will stop other vulnerable people fall into the hand of the people trafficker that be both morally bankrupt and utterly bogus it be morally bankrupt because human right be not earn or contingent on person conduct or character or on whether uphold those right might affect someone else action human right be attach to person by virtue of their humanity vulnerable people include child be be punish because of presume future action of adult furthermore by disagree with lords amendment ministers face the charge of hypocrisy as they disrespect international law and undermine migrant right at time of unprecedented international turmoil just last week the prime minister be at nato summit absolutely say that we need to uphold international law against the grotesque breach by putin in ukraine yes we do need to do that but let we have little moral consistency as well as be immoral the government argument about deterrent effect be bogus and unevidenced the home office own impact assessment publish just last month be pepper with caveat about how undeliverable this policy be it include an admission that the delivery plan be still be develop the lack of evidence on deterrence in that document be glare it say that the bill be novel and untested so we do not know what impact it will have on deterrence as say early raft of child charity have point out that once routine child detention be end in there be no proportional increase in child claim asylum beyond that there be strong evidence to show that it be the precisely the hostility towards refuge exemplify by this bill and the government rejection of lords amendment to it that fuel the grim and terrible trade in small boat that they claim they be against so any member who vote to block the lords amendment should admit that in do so they degrade the rule of law dehumanise vulnerable refugee attack our modern slavery law put lgbt refugee at grave risk and that their approach will lead to the unconscionable mass detention and treatment of child with no stated time limit to that detention it be sicken will be vote to uphold the lords amendment because this bill sham and degrade our country our democracy and this house want to speak mainly about lords amendment and to follow up on the remark make by the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas and the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh hear he make exactly the same argument in the council of europe when to the consternation of most of its member he argue that britain have to criticise and walk away from the european court of human right because one case be find against britain many more case have be find against almost every other country that sign up to the european convention on human right and therefore the court support lords amendment because it give some protection under the european convention the un convention and the convention on statelessness on the right of the child and on action against trafficking the lords amendment will mean that any decision have to be take in accordance with those convention if the government be oppose those what message be they give other than that they have no respect for international law and for the convention we help to write and sign up for and that they want to walk away from they walk away from they will mean that we have no regard for the right of people seek asylum if the european court of human rights find we to be want in that respect therefore should any other country want to walk away from the european convention on human right for example turkey poland or hungary all of which have issue with their legislation in respect of the convention we will be in no position to criticise anybody ever again the idea that this country be face crisis so severe and so serious that we have to walk away from convention that be hard fight for and have serve the human right of people across europe very well be simply ridiculous on global scale the number of people involve be enormous because of economic stress around the world war environmental degradation and destruction and human right abuse that be why people seek asylum the opposition spokesperson my hon friend the member for aberavon stephen kinnock make it clear that he have be to calais have also be to calais and talk to people there they be utterly desperate which be why they be try to seek place of safety people who have seek place of safety in this country and be grant permanent residence here have make an enormous contribution to our society they be work in education health transport and the care sector we have massive labour shortage in almost every industry so it seem to rather odd that we be prevent people who have be grant at least the opportunity to apply for asylum in this country the chance to work and make contribution to the society they have choose to come to other country have far large number of asylum seeker than we do germany have take in far more asylum seeker than this country have as have italy outside europe where all the discussion be take place it be usually the poor country neighbour conflict that have to take in very large number of people for example bangladesh have take in well over million rohingya people from myanmar because of the activity of the myanmar army and there be other example around the world there have to be global response the answer be not to put up barbed wire have surveillance use gunboat and all the rest of it surely the answer be some degree of international co operation that recognise our obligation to all people around the world as global community and that do something about the cause and source of people seek asylum rather than the approach that the bill take suspect the bill will end up be completely ineffective possibly nobody will ever be remove to rwanda hope that be the case would rather we stop it here and now and at least pass amendment that would give those whose duty it be to protect people right recognition of the convention that we have sign up to and have spread around the world say how good we be at sign up to those convention let we stick to our word and stick to those convention as we do not have the opportunity for pre legislative scrutiny of the bill and it be be push through parliament very quickly be pleased that the lords have send back amendment so that we can look again and consider the unintended consequence of part of the bill will speak to the amendment on modern slavery evidence present to the home affairs committee reveal the urgent need to open up more escape route for traffic victim include end the current industrial scale sexual exploitation with woman advertise on pimp website up and down the land in every member constituency on website such as vivastreet which allow woman to be rap multiple time day under this legislation if those woman come forward to the authority they will not be offer help and assistance but will be detain and remove remove those modern slavery protection will do nothing towards do what we all want to happen to bring the organise crime group orchestrate that abuse to justice so support lords amendment to maintain the status quo secondly be disappointed that the lords amendment on child have not be accept child constitute small minority of those make the crossing in small boat often arrive frightened frequently traumatise and always vulnerable such be the concern of the home affairs committee about the current treatment and experience of child who claim asylum in the uk that we recommend the government commission an independent end to end review of the asylum system as it apply to and be experience by child however instead of that the government be hurry through bill to reduce child right no one in this house would want such treatment for their own child which be why support lords amendment and remain in the bill thirdly year ago the home affairs committee publish the result of our inquiry into channel crossing and identify slew of robust measure that the government could deploy to stop small boat crossing and create fair and efficient asylum system they include the creation of safe and legal route and international initiative by the national crime agency to combat people smuggler both of which be the subject of lords amendment under discussion today stop the people smuggling gang will require raft of carefully craft costed and evidence base strategy such as the one put forward by the home affairs committee it be for that reason that firmly support lords amendment on safe and legal route lords amendment on the national crime agency lords amendment and on year strategy and lords amendment on removal destination for lgbt people and other person these measure and the bill as whole must be implement in accordance with our international obligation as be set out in amendment constituent contact recently and say that seem to be speak an awful lot in the chamber about immigration and asylum issue suppose that that be correct but then that be because the government allocate so much time in the chamber to immigration and asylum issue this be the third major piece of primary legislation on immigration since however the majority of constituent hundred of constituent who get in touch with on each of these piece of legislation tell just how disappointed if not horrified they be at the tory uk government attitude to people who come here seek refuge in reject all the lords amendment before we today the government be show just how hostile an environment they want to create not just for asylum seeker but for almost anyone who want to make their home here in the uk the fact that they will not accept lords amendment which be considerably soft version of what we discuss last week demonstrate that if the government be truly committed to the international convention list in the amendment particularly the refugee convention they really should have no problem agree that they will form part of the interpretation of the act when it come into force have also hear from constituent who want to ensure that lgbtq people who arrive here from place where they can face imprisonment for simply be who they be can not be remove to those country that be what the lords be seek to achieve in lords amendment accept that amendment would save time and public money because otherwise by the minister own admission claimant would have to make suspensive claim against removal to their country of origin that be what the minister say he want to avoid he want to avoid loophole and needless court case in that case he should support lords amendment the amendment that seek to protect child from indefinite detention and that maintain human trafficking protection speak for themselves as do the government insistence on reject those amendment the government keep ask those of we who be oppose to the bill for alternative proposal for deal with irregular arrival and these be clearly outline in lords amendment and in the lord archbishop of canterbury amendment and the minister keep say that he want to establish safe and legal route well that be what lords amendment will require he to do have meet many asylum seeker through the maryhill integration network and elsewhere who would much prefer to have come here from eritrea iran or other country that have be mention today through safe and legal route rather than the risk cost and desperation of come on lorry and boat the archbishop proposal for the development of strategy on refugee and human trafficking be perhaps the most straightforward and easily implementable of all the clause and amendment so far the government regularly accept amendment require they to publish strategy and review on all kind of legislation perhaps they do not want to support this one because the transparency and accountability that would come with require the government to undertake long term analysis and make long term plan in response to global population flow would reveal the true hollowness of the rest of their proposal the inhumanity and the self defeat implication of the hostile environment million of people will be on the move in the come year and decade they will be flee war that we have finance and climate change that we have help to cause experience in southern europe and the american midwest this week suggest that they will not just be move from the southern hemisphere either nobody be say that the united kingdom should have completely open border and take unlimited number of migrant but we have to be prepared to take our fair share just as other country welcome refugee flee famine and clearance on these island not that many generation ago if government ministers and back benchers truly respect the role that the house of lords be suppose to play in the uk constitution they really ought to listen to the message that their lordship be send today and will send in the day to come as it stand people in glasgow north and across scotland be listen to the rhetoric of the conservative government and decide that they want no more of it they will be seek the safe and legal route to independence as soon as possible will begin by put on the record my complete opposition to this horrendous bill in its entirety it be cruel and inhumane it will put people at serious risk of further exploitation it be stoke division within our society and it undermine constitutional principle and human right we be here today to focus on amendment so will briefly say that support all the lords amendment before we particularly lords amendment which other have already speak about in the name of my friend baroness chakrabarti the amendment set out the bill intention to comply with host of human right convention include those with regard to the protection of human right and the right of the child and against traffic human being it be vital that we underline our commitment to human right and to quote the first minister of wales mark drakeford provide warm welcome to all of those who seek sanctuary that be particularly important as accommodation site that have be identify by the home office for asylum seeker become target for protest by the far right that be happen in wales at the moment amendment be modest and uncontroversial amendment the lords have back it twice more than organisation have state their support the government must yield and stop vote it down if the government be as they say confident that the bill be compatible with the uk international law obligation there be nothing to fear from the amendment also support lords amendment in the name of baroness stroud conservative peer which provide for duty to establish safe and legal route this be again modest and uncontroversial amendment that could make an unsupportable bill slightly well we need to go much far we need to expand safe route as organisation such as the refugee council and the public and commercial services union have argue in line with the amendment we also need to tackle the backlog with fair humane and speedy processing system the government have lose control over the asylum system their stop the boat rhetoric will not stop the boat because people be genuinely seek asylum from war and poverty and nobody would go on boat risk their life unless they be desperate we should be welcome people to our country what be contain in the bill do not represent the type of country that want to live in or that want my child or grandchild to live in what and million of other want be country and society that be base on care compassion kindness generosity respect inclusivity and yes solidarity support today lords amendment which should be accept but if the bill be pass this week and many other in this house and more importantly outside it will continue to oppose and campaign against this appalling piece of legislation at every opportunity have to reduce the time limit to four minute call claudia webbe thank you madam deputy speaker the provision of the bill be inhumane and punitive it have not improve with the government amendment send to the other place which the other place have rightly reject propose their own counter amendment the government remain determined to allow themselves to detain and deport even unaccompanied child to disqualify many refugee from even attempt to apply for asylum or to appeal against unjust decision and to give the home secretary sweep power to make new rule or apply they as the government see fit even if every amendment propose by the lords be pass this would remain an odious bill and one that sham this house and sham this country but the late lords amendment would at least mitigate some of the bad harm of the legislation legislation that the home secretary can not even say be legal under international law for those reason support all the amendment send back to this house by the other place but wish to speak particularly on the following first the government have reject an amendment that would place statutory duty on they to provide safe and legal route for refugee to reach the uk to apply for asylum on the basis that they have already say that they will introduce such route however promise to do something be not the same as legal obligation to do it and it be clear that this government can barely be trust to comply with their legal obligation let alone their promise as can be see in the unlawful deportation of member of the windrush generation and the very fact that safe and legal route do not already exist we know the government can provide safe and legal route when they wish to we be talk about people flee war conflict and torture with british make bomb force desperate people to flee their home be surprised to hear the minister admit that the government be hold up refugee in pakistan who have flee afghanistan and who need to be here and believe it to be unlawful if the government be serious in intend to establish safe and legal route for those seek asylum they have no need to fear or avoid take upon themselves legal duty to do so promise of well tomorrow be no substitute this be not non issue therefore put on record my support for lords amendment secondly this month more than child charity faith leader medical body and other write to the government to demand that they scrap plan to detain refugee child an abhorrent notion that disgrace this house and bring dishonour on the uk it be deeply inhumane and harmful provision of this bill the idea of detain child especially indefinitely have horrify even some member of the conservative party early this year the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton say that the bill amount effectively to indefinite detention of child of any age anywhere that the home secretary consider it appropriate official report march vol the prime minister have call this bill decent and humane it be clearly neither therefore support lords amendment and which would restrict the detention of child want to apologise to you madam deputy speaker because do not think indicate clearly enough that want to speak thank you for your generous dexterity in find time for want to say one simple thing about the assurance give so far on the detention of child they be not sufficient there be large number of child who will be detain the definition of age appropriate and child appropriate accommodation be not clear enough remind the house of my experience with harmondsworth detention centre in my constituency before when we legislate to prevent child be detain in detention centre that detention centre be also mean to be age and child appropriate but what happen it simply have wing with school and so on and child be lock up in there for month on end we see the report of individual civil society organisation that assess the mental health implication of the detention of child at that stage so far the minister have tell that there be no government intention to detain child in detention centre again but as say to he before intention be not good enough we need legislation to prevent that from happen again my fear be that under pressure government ministers will decide that there will be some appropriate decoration of some section of harmondsworth and it will be open up for child again be house father at child home in hillingdon it be one of the traditional child home run effectively as family unit pursue my own career and my wife be the house mother in charge and be the house father it be like large foster unit basically and we take in child who have be detain in harmondsworth even before it be of the prison style that it be now those child be believe scar for life do not think that we would ever return to lock child up in that way the child we look after often come to we after they have be lose within the system while their case be be process over long time they be often separate from their family who come through other route think the damage be scandal of this country treatment of human being that be why from until we run campaign across all religious group and with civil society organisation such as the children society and publish report after report david cameron come forward heroically and say we will never detain child again and we legislate for that in we be now go back to detain child almost indefinitely for some category we have not get the assurance that we need about where they will be detain or about the care comfort and succour that they will have to support they as result if we allow this legislation to go through it will be stain upon this house and upon society overall for long time to come ask members to think again we now go back into ping pong with the other house which be call simply for realistic time limit on the detention of child so that they be not damage beyond repair in the way they be year ago do not think that simple amendment to set time limit on child suffer in detention when they arrive in this country be an awful lot to ask of the government they often come from country where they have suffer enough we should not impose even more suffering on they with the leave of the house let say few word to close this short debate as say at the outset when we meet and vote time last week we support the bill time and again in each of those vote we in this democratically elect chamber vote to stop the boat secure our border and enable this important bill to move forward now be the time for the other place which be at its heart as number of colleague have say will the minister give way will not we have hear from the hon gentleman number of time the other place be ultimately revise chamber and it be now time for it to support the bill today debate have like some of the other be short on new argument and completely short of any credible alternative go back to the argument make in the other place by many distinguished member of that house and former member of this house most notably the noble lord clarke who say clearly that he be not able have listen to the debate for hour after hour to discern single credible alternative to the government plan it be incumbent on those who want to vote against the bill to bring forward alternative but we have not hear single one use to say that labour member do not have plan to stop the boat but that be not true they do have plan but it be one that be so dangerously naive that it be recipe for even more crossing and even great misery they would create massive pull factor by give economic migrant cross the channel from safe place such as france the ability to work soon they would attempt to grant their way out of the problem and sacrifice the remain integrity of the system they would create bespoke country specific route for every instance of instability in the world which would impose more and more pressure on local community be it not the most telling fact in this debate that today in the shadow immigration minister own town of aberavon there be not single asylum seeker if member want more asylum seeker they should have the honesty to have they in their own constituency from the letter receive from labour mp assume that they would house asylum seeker even more expensively than we do today with no regard to the taxpayer be not clear how they would remove illegal migrant when their own leader the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer campaign to close an immigration removal centre ten of labour mp have oppose the reopening of two other centre and the labour party own membership recently vote to abolish they altogether the fact be that as its member vote against the bill today labour message to the law abide people of this country from stoke to blackpool to peterborough when it come to illegal migration be quite simply put up with it its message to the british family who have to wait long for social housing or gp appointment be tough luck and its message to the hard work taxpayer face with the ever rise cost of the system be cough up it be only the conservative party that can see the fundamental injustice of illegal migration that it ultimately affect the poor people in society the most and have the determination to fix it that be why the bill be so important and it be why the lords now need to back it question put that this house disagree with lords amendment and bim afolami adam afriyie nickie aiken peter aldous lucy allan lee anderson stuart anderson stuart andrew

standards relate to competence and conduct beg to move that this house do not insist on its amendment to which the lords have disagree and agree with the lords in their amendment in lieu we be bring the bill back to the house for what hope be the final time to get this vital legislation on to the statute book it seek to enable the big change in social housing regulation in decade and to drive the change that be so desperately need in the social rent sector when the bill be last before the house we make important amendment to clause on competency and conduct standard in relation to mandatory qualification they make provision to require senior housing manager and senior housing executive of register provider to have or be work towards appropriate level housing management qualification we subsequently table amendment in the other place to ensure that relevant manager employ by organisation that deliver housing management service on behalf of registered provider be also capture by the legislation as be our original policy intention have no doubt that we all welcome and support professionalism from those who check the regulation be always perplexed that we do not have the same regulation in northern ireland be it the minister intention to ensure with the appropriate body in northern ireland that professionalism can also be effective there the hon gentleman be as ever fantastic champion for northern ireland and its people we will of course continue to have conversation with the relevant body in northern ireland because it be important that social housing wherever it be provide within the united kingdom be up to the appropriate standard know he will continue to champion that cause in closing would just like to put on record one final time my and my department heartfelt thank to grenfell united and all other stakeholder for their strong constructive engagement on this critical legislation hope that follow today we will see it on the statute book incredibly soon intend to be brief because the sole amendment we be consider be entirely uncontentious as you will no doubt recall madam deputy speaker the opposition welcome the concession the government make in the other place last year with regard to professional training and qualification and the result addition of clause to the bill have press in committee for that clause to be strengthen we also welcome the government amendment to it which be table on report early this year on the basis that it largely assuage our concern we support lords amendment in lieu of commons amendment as do the relevant trade body and tenant group include grenfell united and shelter whom we once again commend for the role they play in convince the government to incorporate qualification requirement in the bill lord amendment be technical amendment that have three main effect first it will ensure that the qualification requirement in clause capture relevant manager work for organisation which deliver housing management service on behalf of registered provider secondly it will ensure that contractual agreement between registered provider and delegate service provider and relevant sub agreement contain term stipulate that their relevant manager should have or be work towards specify qualification in housing management thus enable register provider to take action against delegate service provider that be not compliant thirdly the amendment expand on definition of service provider and specific role and provide for consultation before set standard and before give direction to set standard we agree with their lordship that the change be necessary if we be to ensure that the sector as whole deliver high quality professional service of the kind social tenant deserve and rightly expect want to put on record our thank to my noble friend lady hayman of ullock for bring the need for this amendment to the government attention and for her effort more generally to improve the bill in the other place it be our sincere hope that once the house have agree this minor but necessary change today this important and urgently need piece of legislation can quickly receive royal assent so that we can overhaul the regulation of social housing and well protect the health safety and wellbeing of social tenant across the country question put and agree to strike minimum service levels bill consideration of lords message schedule minimum service level for certain strike beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment this house have be ask these question before and twice this house have say no with an overwhelming majority we be ask to consider for third time an amendment that significantly expand on previous version that have already be reject member of the other place reference the report of the international labour organisation committee of expert as reason to reconsider however should note that this ground have already be well cover by both houses it be argue that lords amendment require ministers to do what the ilo be request to undertake consultation when consider introduce regulation to implement minimum service level the bill already require ministers to do just that as they have do in undertake public consultation on their intention to bring forward minimum service level to passenger rail service ambulance service and fire and rescue service impact assessment be publish alongside those consultation and final impact assessment will be publish alongside the regulation the government bring forward for approval in parliament in due course my colleague lord callanan be right to say in the other place that the ilo do not say that the legislation be not compatible with ilo convention it simply say that it should be compatible and that we should ensure that it be as state in parliament when introduce and throughout its passage the bill be compatible with the uk international obligation the government will continue to uphold their international obligation as the minimum service regulation be introduce lord amendment also seek to ensure that the reasonable step that union should take to make sure that their member comply be consider as part of the consultation that be require before minimum service regulation be make member will recall that when this house last consider the bill confirm that the government be willing to consider whether there be case for provide further detail on the reasonable step that union must take under new section to ensure that identify worker comply with work notice give by an employer in the light of the recommendation from the joint committee on human rights and point raise in both houses during the bill passage the government accept that further detail would give union more legal certainty and foresight with regard to their obligation than the bill provide in its current form the government will therefore introduce statutory code of practice on the reasonable step that must be take use exist power under section of the trade union and labour relations consolidation act these power enable the secretary of state to issue code of practice to promote the improvement of industrial relation will the minister spell out exactly how trade union be to comply with and enforce code that be outwith their jurisdiction in make worker go into work the code of practice will be consult on so that all party be clear about what the obligation of the union will be we expect they to be quite straightforward they have be debate at length along with various idea about how this might operate rise want to end my speech shortly but will give the hon lady one last chance to intervene as have be point out on numerous occasion the measure that the minister be try to introduce be outside the jurisdiction of trade union which therefore do not have the power to implement they as have say we intend to consult with all party to make sure that they have chance to comment on what reasonable obligation union might be require to take think that it be pretty straightforward and indeed union will be familiar with the code of practice on picketing that be issue under section of the act this code will be subject to statutory consultation include consultation with acas and to the approval of parliament the consultation will give trade union employer and any other interested party an opportunity to contribute to practical guidance on the step that union must take in order to make it as practicable durable and effective as possible if the minister be so willing to consult why be he reject an amendment which confirm that there should be consultation we be not happy with number of other part of the amendment we be propose measure that we have already propose in early debate it be of course up to those in the other place to decide how they take their amendment forward but we believe that this be fair we be satisfied that it be an effective way to provide for clarity and that the individual consultation for specific minimum service level in relevant service require by lords amendment be not need the real impact of the amendment would be delay in the implementation of minimum service level give the additional and lengthy consultation and parliamentary requirement which we strongly suspect be its purpose unnecessary delay in the protection of the life and livelihood of those whom we have be elect to represent can not be justify call the shadow minister draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests let repeat at the outset our opposition to the bill and our intention to repeal the act that it will become should we be in position to do so in the future it be one of the most illiberal unconscionable and ultimately destructive piece of legislation produce by any government we believe that the right to withdraw labour be fundamental right human right and one that should not be extinguish even if some conservative members can not see past their hostility to trade union and past the easy headline they should see that what they be ask their constituent to do be distinctly un british because it infringe on individual freedom that ought to be even for conservative members basic part of any open and democratic society freedom matter and value freedom sometimes mean that we protect another person freedom to do something even if we do not personally agree with the particular course of action but our objection be base not just on principle but on practicality ultimately we do not think that the bill will work the bill be counterproductive because it will not quell the concern of many people in the sector that have take industrial action take away the right to strike will not take away people concern we can not legislate away people legitimate grievance about their working condition because the bill be so ill define and poorly think through parliament must have proper opportunity to consider its ramification the measure set out in lords amendment attempt to address some of those issue the amendment also provide yet another opportunity for we to raise our concern about the government lax approach to proper scrutiny during the bill progress so far let we go back to when the bill be first publish it be surely basic expectation of government that they should provide an impact assessment before ask hon member to vote on bill but no we be ask to trust the government that the matter be in hand and that all would be fine we say it at the time and we say it again that approach be completely unacceptable the bill have be trail in the press for month before it be publish so not to have the impact assessment ready at the same time be failure of basic competence when it finally appear we could see why the government be so keen to keep it under wrap the regulatory policy committee say that it be not fit for purpose it could just as easily have be talk about the government and no wonder give that the assessment contain statement that undermine both the purpose and execution of the bill the impact assessment state that the bill could mean general increase in tension between union and employer this may result in more adverse impact in the long term such as an increase frequency of strike for each dispute when ministers tell we on second reading that the bill would reduce the disruption cause by strike what they apparently do not know be that the government own impact assessment would say that it could in fact have the opposite effect the impact assessment also say on at least half dozen occasion that assumption be be make about the level of service that would be require that be the point of the lords amendment unless we have some idea about what these minimum service level will be in the six month since the bill be publish ministers have not come to the dispatch box and tell we we be legislate in vacuum the point have not be lose on the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee which write in its assessment that there be nothing in the bill say what those minimum service level be we shall only know when minister make regulation after the bill be enact this be small comfort to parliament which be consider the matter right now the committee recommendation be that the government should publish indicative draft regulation alongside the bill as it rightly point out the government must have some idea how they propose to exercise these power it be no surprise that the impact assessment get red rating of the bills assess by the regulatory policy committee since its creation just have be give red rating when legislation represent such fundamental departure from past practice the importance of impact assessment increase rather than decrease if this all sound familiar to you madam deputy speaker that be because it be only last week the high court say in relation to the consultation process for the regulation that allow agency worker to break strike that this be not case in which the evidence be that the proposal have obvious and undisputed merit base on cogent evidence and enjoy strong support from representative body in the sector it could have be talk about this bill no doubt in time it will be the pattern be familiar the government decide the policy although policy be probably too strong word the government decide the headline that they want to create rush through ill thought out legislation and then ignore all the voice that point out principled and practical objection that be to treat democracy with contempt parliament be not rubber stamp process to agree whatever the government of the day decide when parliament be starve of its ability to properly scrutinise legislation that impact on fundamental human right as it do in this case it should come as no surprise that there be pushback from the other place require that robust process be follow the amendment be important because the international labour organisation conference committee on the application of standard call on the government to ensure that exist and prospective legislation be in conformity with the convention that govern freedom of association and the protection of the right to organise would not have think that be too much to ask of modern liberal democracy in fact be rather ashamed that the ilo have have to point it out at all all this amendment do be what the ilo be ask the government to do anyway which be to undertake genuine consultation before implement minimum service regulation this mean that when regulation be publish they would include an impact assessment and there should be genuine consultation on the regulation include on the protection for worker name in work notice and the reasonable step trade union need to take to ensure compliance the amendment would also ensure that the relevant secretary of state consult with the ilo and lay before parliament any advice it give as well as lay report from the relevant joint committee on all the action require under this amendment this be important not just because the ilo think it be need but because it fill some of the hole in the process so far indeed it may address some of the important question that still need answer right now under this bill trade union can receive huge fine if their member go on strike when they be ask not to do so by their employer yet there be no information in the bill on what trade union will need to do to avoid that liability imagine if the government present bill that have the potential for business to receive seven figure fine but say nothing about what those business need to do to comply there would be uproar from member on both side of the house and they would be right to be concern what be sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander the minister have belatedly say that new code of practice will be bring forward which be an improvement on the government previous position that it be for the court to decide what should be reasonable step we be the legislator we be the one who be mean to shape and determine act of parliament we should not leave it to judge to try to work it out possibly year down the line such ambiguity could be very costly for trade union and it certainly be not recipe for improved industrial relation give the government track record on provide detail on the various step in this bill have little confidence that code of practice will provide any comfort at all it be the epitome of this headline first detail later government and it be just one of the many reason why the bill should be abandon altogether at the very least it be good reason to support the amendment of course the minister have say that the government be consult on the regulation and they be after fashion so far though consultation have be limit to only half the area for which the bill legislate and those area do not really deal with the fundamental question that have be raise can the minister at least tell we the basis on which these particular service area be identify as the one on which to commence consultation the response to the consultation have not be publish do the minister agree that we should have sight of the response before the bill pass do any of the response say for example that minimum service level be unworkable be there anything in the response that he think parliament ought to be aware of before we vote on the bill again can he even tell we the total number of response to each consultation and the breakdown and proportion of response from service user employer and union ultimately these consultation paper still do not tell we what minimum service level will look like even for the railway for which the government have be look to set minimum service level the long arguably since the last general election they do not have concrete plan and on page and of the ambulance service impact assessment there be statement that show the folly of this legislation because it state in black and white that minimum service level could lead to poor service than be currently agree voluntarily the only thing we have learn from these consultation document be that even the government do not think the bill will deliver what they say it will deliver there be nothing on the reasonable step trade union must take nothing on what happen to worker who be sack for fail to comply with work notice even if they have not receive it and nothing on how any of this will actually help to resolve industrial dispute be sorry to interrupt my hon friend when he be in full flow but as he be develop his argument on the need for consultation and impact assessment have he be able to clarify with the government what happen if an employer refuse to comply in london for example the bus be contract out and individual bus company have have individual dispute if the government instruct there to be minimum service level but the employer do not want to sour industrial relation in the long term and therefore refuse to comply what then happen that be very good question my understanding no doubt the minister can correct if be wrong be that it be still up to the employer to determine what work notice it issue which make the bill little ludicrous all these consultation paper all these impact assessment and we be still legislate in the dark my hon friend have just make valid point because when nhs employers and the nhs confederation come before the select committee on health and social care they say that they do not want any of this legislation presumably follow that logic they will not have to issue minimum service level term for strike thank my hon friend for her intervention that be why it would have be so interesting to see what the consultation response be to the draft regulation because those might have tell we whether employer be say do do this we do think it be go to work we know that long list of employer organisation be oppose to this bill and will come on to that in moment they understand that ultimately it be not go to help industrial relation but will sour they in summary the bill impact assessment turn up late and be inadequate no pre legislative scrutiny or evidence session for the bill take place the committee stage be rush through in one day and subsequent consultation be incomplete and leave many question unanswered yet the government still say that this lords amendment be not necessary the evidence to date and the opinion of the ilo say otherwise refer to the fact that the ilo be not alone in express concern about the bill many organisation have express alarm include the equality and human rights commission the joint committee on human rights nhs providers the rail industry the chartered institute of personnel and development the tuc and the welsh and scottish governments the transport secretary and the education secretary have also do so and could give more name but have only an hour for this debate and so will leave it there when we have the shameful spectacle of the ilo call this bill out member need to think again by reject this lords amendment the government be in effect say one of two thing either they do not know whether they break international law or they do know but they just do not care we ought to care we ought not to be trail behind in workplace protection and we ought not to be mention in the same breath as turkmenistan we ought to be lead from the front as an exemplar for other country to follow and leader on the international stage that say yes good workplace right and strong trade union be key component in any prospering modem economy and the right to withdraw your labour be fundamental one however this bill be the hallmark of weak government who have run out of steam have nothing leave to offer but division and want to silence the very people who keep this country go shame on they call the scottish national party spokesperson it be pleasure to follow the shadow minister the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders agree with all his comment but hope that labour stay resolute on this if it come into government we do not want to see another turn give what we hear at the weekend the minister put forward the myth again about how this bill be about save life and livelihood do not know how he can talk about save livelihood as he be bring forward bill that be go to allow worker to be sack more easily worker livelihood be at stake because of the bill and the intention behind it would like to put on record my thank to the lords for the fight they have bring on this but be wee bit disappointed that the lords amendment be only about the consultation even if we manage to defeat the government tonight the lords amendment do not provide any additional proper protection for the union or the worker because it be all about consulting at least consulting would draw out some transparency because the government would need to publish response and allow the house or joint committee to debate those in itself however the amendment do not provide any additional protection do it not speak volume about the way in which this government conduct their business that they go through consultation process and be not prepared to publish the result of that consultation what have they get to hide that be fair point obviously can not answer on what the government have to hide other than to say that we know about raft of answer that show how unworkable and prejudice this bill be subsection in the amendment be about consult the ilo the government keep tell we that this bill bring the legislation in the uk into line with international norm but it clearly do not the ilo have say that the uk already have some of the most draconian strike legislation even before this bill so there be no doubt that the government be frightened to consult the ilo because they be frightened about the answer that will come back and the evidence about how draconian this really be that will be put into the public domain when it be publish as say it look as if the lords be go to back down after this there be no more schedule business to allow further consideration of the lords message which suggest they be not go to push the amendment beyond that that be disappointing especially give that the government have try to argue before that this be manifesto commitment the actual manifesto commitment be to require minimum service for transport that commitment be not as wide ranging so the lords would be completely justify in continue to resist for as long as possible as the shadow minister say because the amendment be to consult as oppose to what be set out in previous amendment union be still at risk of face big fine union be still go to comply effectively help employer disrupt strike and single out worker bad of all worker can now get sack for not comply with work notice that they have not receive why the government would not even consult and publish an impact assessment on that be beyond again they know that it allow employer to unfairly discriminate pick out the awkward squad then discipline and sack they with no recourse to tribunal welcome madam deputy speaker to century authoritarian britain where sack worker like that bring the uk in line with russia and hungary not the international norm although the minister and government try to tell we otherwise will be vote against the government motion to disagree with the lords hope the lords do not give up the fight but be frightened they will that be why we want away from this union because it be certainly not work for anybody the minister have let the cat out of the bag in relation to the government attitude to this dreadful bill and to amendment from the other place the minister object to lords amendment because it would delay the implementation of the bill let we be clear the bill make history for all the wrong reason it be the big attack on the role of our trade union in our democracy for many long year why be the government so desperate to rush the bill through one almost think they can not stomach the idea of even small delay because they want it to be present at the conservative party conference as bit of red meat to the party faithful classic anti trade union politic and trade union bash let we think about where we be in term of industrial relation the bill which the government do not want to consult on properly come shortly after over nurse in this country vote to take strike action the result in that recent ballot be that of nurse who cast vote do so to take strike action however because of the government dreadful trade union act an vote in favour of strike action do not count be worthless and do not result in strike action because the turnout be the government help drive down the turnout by not allow people to vote by electronic ballot the former prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss who make such mess of this country in her short tenure be elect by electronic ballot of conservative party member not allow people to vote by electronic mean reveal the contempt the government have for the big voluntary organisation in our society the trade union movement they will not even give worker in our country the modern dignity of be allow to vote online or in the workplace the government object to lords amendment and do not want to consult on it be that any wonder the great the consultation that take place in relation to this abhorrent bill the more it become clear that the bill be complete offence let we be clear the bill which the government do not want to have proper consultation on require trade union to take reasonable step to get their own member to break trade union picket line this bill require trade union to completely change their function in our democratic society it be the job of trade union to persuade trade union member to honour strike vote not to break strike we see the hand of this authoritarian government attempt to extend into our trade union try to try to use they as tool of the state to do the bidding of conservative government or the bidding of employer the bill be rotten and it be no wonder that the government do not want to consult on it any fair minded person whatever their politic would realise that that be not the function of trade union in our society we have hear ministers boast about how this will result in people be sack if they do not comply with the requirement to go to work indicate dissent the minister shake his head if what be say be not true why do he not take that measure out of the bill so that worker can not be sack for not comply with work notice that be in the legislation shall be charitable to the minister have listen to he in number of debate sometimes think that he do not realise quite how pernicious the bill be but think that other in the conservative party do they know exactly what they be do this anti trade union bill which the government do not wish to consult on properly come hot on the heel of the criminalisation of peaceful protest which be democratic right in our society and hot on the heel of voter id when what we should be do be make it easy for people to vote in our society not hard this be an anti trade union piece of legislation that sham the government people can see through it the government can not even pretend to be up for proper consultation by accept lords amendment they know what the ilo think of it they know what our colleague in the other place think of it and they know what the british people think of it that be why the next labour government will repeal this rotten piece of legislation if indeed it pass and bring in an important suite of worker right because worker and trade union in this country have have enough of be treat like dirt for the past year let we stop this race to the bottom in worker right and instead build democratic system democratic system where we can be proud of the worker right in our country may draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests the lords have be set an unenviable task in attempt to amend piece of legislation as ill conceive as this one as lifelong opponent of the principle of an unelected second chamber be surprised to find myself now commend the thoughtfulness and diligence that the other place have demonstrate in its many sitting concern this legislation it have be breath of fresh air when compare with this government recklessness in attempt to rush the bill through parliament rise in support of lords amendment its purpose be simple to ensure that perhaps the most significant piece of trade union legislation to be consider by this house in more than century be subject to appropriate scrutiny before it be add to the statute book wish to repeat the comment that make when we consider the lords amendment on may say that no number of amendment could ever salvage this bill it be rotten to the core it target right that should be sacrosanct in any democracy the right to withdraw our labour in sector such as education and health the provision of the bill will hobble the ability of work people to fight for the dignity and fairness that we all deserve in the workplace and make the trade union themselves unwilling accomplice in undermine the effectiveness of their own industrial action worse still in sector such as air traffic control or nuclear decommissioning minimum service regulation will in effect amount to ban on take any strike action at all minister have repeatedly insist that their policy towards the trade union movement conform with international standard and our treaty obligation that be not the view take by the high court last week when it quash the government law allow employer to bring in scab labour to break strike the court verdict be damn that the government approach be so unfair as to be unlawful and indeed irrational despite the claim make by this government that the international labour organisation support minimum service standard the director general of the ilo have make an unprecedented intervention in voice his concern about the effect of the bill on worker and of the government strategy of impose minimum service requirement on worker instead of encourage they to be negotiate between union and management most embarrassingly of all for the government the bill have be slam by their own independent regulatory policy committee as be not fit for purpose the question that all of we should be ask be why the bill be not withdraw the moment the rpc slap it with red rating in february why be we still debate proposal that have be condemn by not only my friend in the trade union movement but vast swathe of trade association and the business community their verdict be astoundingly clear they do not think the bill will work they be concern with good cause that it will make industrial relation in this country bad they simply do not want the bill the answer be simple the government be aware of their impending electoral oblivion they be intent on drive through reform that will realise their decade long dream of world in which worker be strip of all their right and leave helpless at the whim of their employer it be about time for little more candour from those on the government benches thank all member for their contribution to the debate think that it be time to agree to disagree with some of the point that have be make by opposition members the bill be compatible with our international obligation which the government will continue to uphold we have announce new code of practice which will provide the clarity that opposition member have be ask for throughout the bill passage encourage the other place to take note of the strong view of this house and that its will should be respect question put that this house disagree with lords amendment bim afolami adam afriyie nickie

question agree to independent parliamentary standards authority relevant document first report of the speaker committee for the independent parliamentary standards authority appointment of ipsa board member former high judicial office holder hc beg to move that an humble address be present to his majesty pray that his majesty will appoint dame laura cox to the office of ordinary member of the independent parliamentary standards authority with effect from august for the period end on july the speaker committee for the independent parliamentary standards authority have produce report its first report of in relation to the motion have no doubt that member will have study that report closely and will know of dame laura background note that the recruitment panel consider dame laura an eminently appointable candidate ipsa be quite rightly independent of parliament and government but as all members will know and understand it have an incredibly important role in regulate and administer the business cost of hon member and decide their pay and pension hope that the house will support this appointment and wish dame laura well in this important role and commend the motion to the house call the shadow leader of the house rise to support the motion in the name of the leader of the house and to say that dame laura cox have bring great deal to this house she have challenge we she have work with we she have review the independent complaint and grievance system thereby strengthen our system of accountability for bullying and sexual harassment and she have come to know we well believe she will be good critical friend she have be duly well appoint and support the motion call the scottish national party spokesperson the snp pay tribute to sir robert owen who leave the ipsa board in april and wish he the good for the future we welcome the appointment of dame laura cox to fill the vacancy with her extensive and esteemed judicial career and dedication to equality and human right she will bring invaluable experience to the role in as have be mention dame laura lead the independent inquiry into bullying and harassment of house of commons staff and be involve in select the chair and member of the independent expert panel so she have an in depth knowledge of this place note that the appointment panel recognise her strong understanding of ipsa its challenge and the political landscape in which it operate the panel also highlight dame laura prove track record of make difficult decision under intense public scrutiny have no doubt that she will be an exceptional addition to the ipsa board and the snp support the motion as regularly on these occasion say to the house that have no particular knowledge of the individual concern or any animus towards they but have huge concern about the process hope that when the leader of the house be look at rigorous analysis and make tough decision about ipsa she look for example at why it have expensive office in the strand in london when nearly all the staff seem to be work from home and why the experience of individual member in deal with ipsa staff be that they be not facilitator of the work of hard press and hard work members of parliament but most of the time with one or two individual exception but certainly as an institution be just incredibly obstructive it create huge amount of unnecessary and bureaucratic work not just for members of parliament but for our member of staff know that this be echo across the chamber from the number of member who come up to after speech such as this to say so many of whom may even have be watch in their office while grind through their ipsa return very much object to the process the parliamentary standards act which be bring in in haste and in response to crisis and in panic would argue specifie that at least one of the member of ipsa must be person who have hold but no long hold high judicial office why what do the requirement to have hold high judicial office or to have be an eminent barrister have to do with decide how efficiently to deal with people expense would argue that somebody from one of the big corporation who actually understand something about run salary and expense scheme might be lot well at do that but such person be not specify suspect that someone who have be trade union official or convener in major company would have much well idea about how to run such system efficiently and effectively than someone who have never have such responsibility note that this individual have be head of chamber which would give they some understanding but not of deal with several hundred people in the way that ipsa have to do one of the problem we seem to have at the moment this be what want to highlight to the house be that we have now erect new priesthood find it very interesting that people complain about have bishop of the church of england in the house of lords but almost everything now have to be allocate to senior judge these people have lot of training and many of they be extremely intelligent but that do not make they the only people in this country who have good judgment be able to assess case or be able to run something almost everything now seem to be delegate to the lawyer and to the judiciary find it really rather amusing entertaining and slightly surprising from the conservative party give that its support newspaper be regularly castigate the judiciary on their front page that for everything that relate to this house it somehow seem to allocate they special place and special privilege when we look through appointment not just to this board but to the board of so many public body that come before this house time and again the only people who be choose be the great and the good from various non governmental organisation that get award that be another tick in box or those who have serve on number of quango it be not someone who be actually run business day to day someone who be do the real job of work as nurse or doctor in hospital or figure from the car industry for example none of those people get look in because we hand over this process to search consultant who keep fish in the same pool we need to call that out and say that there be great wealth of talent in this country our class system time and again ignore that pool of talent in all walk of life and we have even institutionalise it in the legislation set up the ipsa board so end as begin have we be close to might have feel the need to expand far but we be not by say that this be nothing to do with the individual concern it be really to do with self perpetuate system that be basically about look after chum and it be about time we change it question put and agree to liaison committee motion make and question propose that notwithstanding the provision of standing order no the liaison committee shall have power to appoint specialist adviser in relation to its inquiry on strategic thinking in government penny mordaunt since object to this motion go through on the nod the other night be surprised that my right hon friend the leader of the house be move it formally instead of try to explain the background to this move we have always have the system in this house that the liaison committee comprise those member who have be appoint by the house to be chair of select committees and those chair meet together to comprise the liaison committee the liaison committee be set up under standing order no an appointment be make in this parliament by the former member for uxbridge boris johnson who as prime minister listen sympathetically to representation make by my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin say that he have not be appoint successfully to be elect to select committee and would it not be wonderful to break with precedent and create new post for somebody who be not already select committee chair but who would become chair of the liaison committee have no objection to the decision that the former prime minister take in appoint my hon friend as chair of the liaison committee but be concerned that now with his have be appoint to that committee we be engage in bit of mission creep standing order no specifie select committee shall be appoint to be call the liaison committee and its role shall be to consider general matter relate to the work of select committee to give such advice relate to the work of select committee as may be seek by the house of commons commission and to report to the house its choice of select committee report to be debate on such day as may be appoint by the speaker in pursuance of paragraph of standing order no sitting in westminster hall the committee may also hear evidence from the prime minister on matter of public policy we know that that be essentially the high profile role of the liaison committee to try to hold the prime minister to account my hon friend as chair of that committee play significant role in try to hold the former prime minister boris johnson to account perhaps the hon gentleman will correct be it right that we have joint strategic committee can not remember its exact name but if have know this subject be come up would have look it up which think be chair by my right hon friend the member for derby south margaret beckett surely strategic issue and strategic security and so on should be within the remit of that committee under our current structure the right hon gentleman be absolutely right we be not short of committees in this house and the purpose of standing order no be to set up liaison committee whether that be useful exercise be for other to judge it be approve and set up in the standing orders but now without vigilance on our part we will find that that liaison committee be become almost like select committee in its own right and carry out its own inquiry inquiry that could be carry out by any of the other individual select committees now in the motion on the order paper it be seek funding for the appointment of special adviser to facilitate its work it seem to that the case for this measure have not be make be sorry as say early that my right hon friend the leader of the house do not make the case at the beginning of this debate instead of wait to respond to the debate later refer again to standing order no it state the committee shall report its recommendation as to the allocation of time for consideration by the house of the estimate on any day or half day which may be allot for that purpose and upon motion be make that the house do agree with any such report the question shall be put forthwith and if that question be agree to the recommendation shall have effect as if they be order of the house proceeding in pursuance of this paragraph though oppose may be decide after the expiration of the time for opposed business sub paragraph to of that standing order state the committee shall have power to send for person paper and record to sit notwithstanding any adjournment of the house and to report from time to time unless the house otherwise order each member nominate to the committee shall continue to be member of it for the remainder of the parliament the committee shall have power to appoint two sub committee one of which shall be national policy statements sub committee the standing order then set out what that sub committee could be comprise of and what it would do be not aware of any such sub committee on national policy statement have yet be appoint but if be wrong about that be sure will be correct by my right hon friend the leader of the house the liaison committee also have the power to set up another sub committee if it so wish each sub committee have requirement about quorum and the fact that it need to report minute of evidence and so on it be clear from read that standing order that the liaison committee have limited remit it be particularly design to ensure that because the prime minister do not answer and will not give evidence to other select committees he come along regularly to the liaison committee and he be hold to account there that be all very well so why have we end up where we be today on the order paper the motion state notwithstanding the provision of standing order no the one to which have be refer the liaison committee shall have power to appoint specialist adviser in the plural in relation to its inquiry on strategic thinking in government it may well be that there be shortage of strategic thinking in government and that that inquiry into the shortage of strategic thinking be require but be surprised that that inquiry be be conduct by the liaison committee when any of the other select committees would be able to inquire into that issue in relation to their remit the liaison committee have set up that inquiry on strategic thinking in government and it want to have special adviser appoint and imagine pay out of the public purse to provide advice to the committee which be as emphasise select committee in name but not by nature this be an example of mission creep have the privilege of speak early to my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex the chairman of the liaison committee who draw to my attention the press release issue by the liaison committee on june this year it state the liaison committee be launch an inquiry into select committee scrutiny of strategic thinking across whitehall in other word it be try to find out whether select committees be up to the task of scrutinise strategic thinking across government that would be fair enough one might think however when one look at the small print the chair comment and the term of reference one find that far from be an inquiry into select committee scrutiny of strategic thinking across whitehall this be an inquiry into strategic thinking across whitehall nothing to do with the select committees for which the liaison committee have be specifically establish the hon gentleman be generous in give way once again have be listen to he expand on that point would it not be more appropriate for such an inquiry to be conduct by the public accounts committee which have inevitably undertake similar study into thinking because of the resource consequence that arise from strategic thinking or the lack thereof be that not the appropriate route that in my view would be wholly appropriate why do the national audit office which feed into much of the public accounts committee work not get involve if it think that this be big issue incidentally today the national audit office report on the government hospital building programme and find in the small print that christchurch hospital be no long part of the hospital be build it have be withdraw from the programme and will be add to future programme that be rightly criticise by the national audit office and that be current example of why we need proper scrutiny to return to what the liaison committee say it want to do in this new inquiry the chair comment be major event such as brexit and ukraine demonstrate the need for long term planning and delivery across multiple department and across the duration of several parliaments as well as the importance of successful collaboration with our international partner as the pace of event over recent year have show the government need to be more agile in its ambition and it should also be coordinate across department and sustainable over time select committee provide mirror to government policy and practice their work have demonstrate the value of cross party check and balance on departmental strategic thinking this inquiry by the liaison committee will consider how select committee can improve scrutiny of strategic thinking in government as the uk confront the major question we face in the near and long term future well scrutiny of strategic thinking by parliament will contribute to well strategic thinking within government be sorry that be not able to précis that madam deputy speaker that be one of the issue we have as parliament and with the government there be too much verbosity in these sort of announcement but be that as it may then look at the term of reference expect that they would be exclusively direct to strategic thinking in select committees and the select committee control over strategic thinking in government but the call for evidence member and other be tell that they must send in write evidence by friday september state the committee be look for evidence on example of good practice of strategic thinking in government include how well government identify strategic opportunity as well as strategic risk and threat how effectively government use internal and external challenge how feedback loop whatever those be be use to ensure that lesson from delivery be fully consider when develop future strategic plan and how no and the cabinet office should well lead on these issue across government that be one item the second item be what government should publish or explain about its overall strategic concept surely the section that the hon gentleman have just read out there may be more of it be in the remit of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee absolutely do not know perhaps we will find out later the extent to which the public administration and constitutional affairs committee have be consult on this and have agree that on government strategic thinking it will have its role usurp by the liaison committee be sure that all will be reveal in due course if my hon friend want to intervene on these issue will be happy to take intervention the next item of the term of reference be what additional machinery of government knowledge and skill be necessary to support strategic thinking and effective strategy and delivery both within individual department and across two or more department and how strategy and strategic thinking can be sustain by build consensus between the main party the fourth item on which evidence can be give be which government around the world demonstrate good practice in strategic thinking that be an opportunity for some overseas visit no doubt to go and see which government across the world be demonstrate good practice in strategic thinking the next item of the term of reference the sixth contain the first reference to select committees how select committee consider strategic question include any recent example of scrutiny of government strategic plan their delivery and element of government and delivery that be repeatedly identify by select committees as effective or as deficient at least that item on which evidence be seek be relevant to the purported nature of the inquiry the next item in the term of reference be the engagement of individual department and whitehall as whole with select committees on strategic challenge include through the provision of information necessary for effective scrutiny the next one be what additional resource more taxpayer money be go into this can see parliamentary procedure knowledge and skill be necessary to support effective select committee scrutiny of strategic thinking and effective strategy making as well as monitor implementation of any government action in response this be great one how other parliament around the world be engage with the strategic thinking of their respective government well what an inquiry it could take year could it not woe betide whoever be appoint special adviser under the term of the motion before we they will need to be handsomely remunerate will they not for the time and effort they put into the inquiry they will have global remit speak as member of two select committees the procedure committee and the environmental audit committee the environmental audit committee be cross cut and look at the effect of the government environmental policy across whole range of area the liaison committee seem to be create new cut select committee cover public administration strategic thinking oversee democracy and so on want to hear the justification for that what the cost be likely to be and how this idea ever get start be it discuss by the liaison committee do it agree those very wide term of reference do it think through the implication in support the motion have the leader of the house think through exactly what that strategic thinking be all about apologise for not be in the chamber for the start of the debate but have be listen to my hon friend carefully on the television order can just say to the right hon gentleman that it be absolutely customary to be in at the start of speech if the right hon gentleman be go to intervene this be such an important debate and my hon friend be raise such an important point about the fundamental of the liaison committee do understand from what he be say that the committee would need to change its name if it take on those responsibility because its job be simply liaison not to go far than that absolutely that be why be worried about the mission creep we have the liaison committee proposal set out in the press release to which have be refer but it bear little resemblance to the motion on the order paper which state that the liaison committee shall have power to appoint specialist adviser in relation to its inquiry on strategic thinking in government its inquiry purport to be on the ability of select committees to scrutinise strategic thinking across government which be completely different as anybody who have be listen to the term of reference will know it be not limit to strategic thinking across our government but restrict to strategic thinking across all government that be member of the united nations so it have an enormously wide remit must say that congratulate my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex the chair of the committee on his imagination and breadth of vision he could have job for life fulfil this important role but our job in question matter like this which be put on the order paper and would otherwise go through on the nod be to say well hang on minute what be we about have the member of the rest of the select committees think about the implication the cost and the dangerous precedent that be be set it be only in this parliament that we get the exception to have chair of the liaison committee who be not already chair of another select committee but how will the member of the liaison committee be able to give their time and devotion to this particular subject for example be member of one of the committees that very much deal with strategy and strategic thinking the defence committee be not aware may have miss it that there have be any reference to that committee on whether it think this move be appropriate or not well there we have it madam deputy speaker and see my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex the chair of the liaison committee at the bar of the house do not know whether he intend to participate in this debate the hon gentleman ought to know that it be very difficult for the member who have just come in to participate in the debate when he have already be speak for nearly minute have assume that he have inform the hon member that he be go to refer to he madam deputy speaker be talk to my hon friend the chair of the committee early on today and he give be not sure that quite count as inform he that you be go to mention he in debate but assume that that be what you be indicate be indicate that be refer to he in the debate because he indeed give the liaison committee term of reference and the press release include the quote from himself since he be the chair of the liaison committee be rather surprised that he have not make himself available to participate in this debate particularly give that it be all about much more important role for that committee which he have the privilege of chairing have not realise madam deputy speaker when rise to my foot at the beginning of this debate that my hon friend be not actually in his place now see that he be not in his place but at the bar of the house but because of what you say the debate perhaps start early than he expect he will not now be able to participate in it and will have to rely on the leader of the house to put the case which he would otherwise be able to put himself as to why this proposal do not amount to an expensive and unnecessary mission creep on the part of the liaison committee it be in my view probably unique to this parliament that we have chair of the liaison committee who be not already the chair of another committee wonder how the member of the liaison committee all of whom be chair of other committees will physically be able to get to grip with the enormous subject of the quality of strategic thinking across the world because that be what we be talk about the house will know that be second to none in my admiration for my hon friend but actually be member of the liaison committee and think that in draw his comment to close he will like welcome any progress in strategic thinking in government and particularly in this government be all in favour of more strategic thinking and know that my hon friend be great exemplar of it he have deploy that talent over many year in the house and continue so to do but be disappoint in sense that in his intervention he do not address the issue of mission creep and why this subject can not be deal with by the public administration committee or by other select committees that have already be set up under the rule of the house he do disclose to we that he be member of the liaison committee although he do not say how enthusiastic he be about be able to participate in the evidence gathering and the consideration of the evidence that be gather in conjunction with this particular remit of set out the inquiry on strategic thinking in government it often happen that towards the end of parliament the government be try to think beyond the next general election and perhaps in propose this motion my hon friend the chair of the liaison committee be think beyond this parliament to the next perhaps he be think that the liaison committee in that parliament may have some unfinished business in relation to its inquiry on strategic thinking and that the specialist adviser will be champ at the bit want their remuneration to be extend to an inquiry that will continue dare one say ad infinitum maybe do not know but think that something like this should not go through the house without member have be alert to its potential consequence and implication which be why have speak about the motion in this way thank the hon gentleman for give way again he be be very generous accord to his reading on the background of the committee do it intend to hold hearing and evidence session and would that mean that all the select committee chairs would have to attend weekly session in order to hear the evidence and then prepare the report that be very good point the committee be specifically call for write evidence normally when select committees call for write evidence and that evidence come in they decide that the most compelling evidence should probably be supplement by oral evidence from those who have submit the write evidence it be presume implicit in the fact that the committee have invite write evidence that it will also receive oral evidence and will cross examine or question some of the people who have submit that write evidence whether it be from member of the australian parliament the canadian parliament or the hungarian parliament who know but imagine that they will be hold oral evidence session as the right hon member for warley john spellar imply if an oral evidence session be not within the remit of the one of the specific sub committees of the liaison committee to which refer early there will be need for quorum and for people to be there pay close attention to the evidence where be we go this be essentially new select committee that be be expand to cover everybody else area of responsibility so that it can have grandiose role it be not sufficient for it to be able to hold the prime minister to account and allocate question to the prime minister among liaison committee member now we be get into the whole area not of the role of select committees in hold the government to account on their strategic challenge but of the strategic challenge in toto in summary what be really say be that despair despair that this proposal have reach the stage it have look forward to hear an explanation from the leader of the house about why she think this be good move hope that she will be able to explain how our fear and concern about dangerous precedent can be allay strategic thinking be perhaps just the start of takeover bid by the liaison committee of almost all the other subject that be the remit of individual select committees at the moment who know in the absence of any contribution from the chair of the liaison committee himself we depend on the knowledge that the leader of the house have gain from the briefing that she have no doubt receive as do from the liaison committee be all in favour of strategic thinking and of scrutinise the government strategic thinking but do not think that this be the right way forward on point of order madam deputy speaker may through you apologise for not have be present from the start of these proceeding be not expect this business to be debate this evening should have be more alert as my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope have be to the possibility that it would be would not consider it appropriate to try to catch your eye to make contribution to this debate madam deputy speaker unless you deem it appropriate do say that if the right hon gentleman want to make contribution he should have be here at the beginning may clarify whether he be tell that he would be refer to in the debate do not think we need to make an issue of that madam deputy speaker be go to say that if the right hon gentleman have not be tell it would be perfectly reasonable for he to make contribution in the circumstance be prepared to allow he to make one minute contribution be most grateful madam deputy speaker appreciate the courtesy be extend to first should reiterate that there be support among all the select committee chairs for the inquiry secondly the issue be about the effectiveness of select committee scrutiny many select committees find it difficult to obtain information about long term challenge face this country particularly if they be cross departmental issue the select committee inquiry will be concentrate on that thirdly there be ample precedent for liaison committee inquiry into the effectiveness of the select committee system that be what the liaison committee exist to do and it be firmly within its remit we be confine ourselves to that be delighted to hear from my hon friend that the liaison committee will confine itself to that but in that case why be the term of reference call for write evidence by september so widely set that they cover will not repeat all those point madam deputy speaker which government around the world demonstrate good practice in strategic thinking there be also reference to strategic thinking about select committees order want to call the leader of the house so do not want the hon gentleman to read out list be most grateful to you madam deputy speaker and to my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope who be talk about the context of the inquiry how can we conduct the inquiry in vacuum without reference to what happen in other country what other parliaments be do to scrutinise long term strategic thinking and what other government be do in response there be strong public interest in this and have hold very close interest in the subject matter which he generously acknowledge this be not threat to select committees the chairman of the defence committee on which the right hon member for warley john spellar sit have support this inquiry and hope he will take part we do not imagine that we will have great number of oral evidence session because select committee chairs be so busy much of this will be conduct on desktop basis through write evidence rather than through oral evidence session hope that clarify it for the house and be most grateful to you madam deputy speaker for allow to make contribution under these circumstance thank all member who have take part in the debate table today motion follow request from the chairman of the liaison committee with the blessing of the liaison committee be facilitate that request on mission creep the chairman of the liaison committee have set out why the inquiry be take place but hon member should note that the change we be make limit the appointment of special adviser to this particular inquiry the appointment will be make within the current budget envelope member may be interested to know that as the shadow leader of the house will verify the commission discuss the work of select committees at its last meeting those minute have be publish and the finance committee be take great role in scrutinise the work of select committees and ensure value for money we be not here to debate the merit of this particular inquiry although hon member will know the previous work of the chairman of the liaison committee in this area what we be here to decide be whether the committee should have special adviser to assist it in this particular inquiry commend the motion to the house question put and agree to business without debate transport ordered that chris loder be discharge from the transport committee and sara britcliffe be bill wiggin on behalf of the committee of selection pandemic fiscal policies motion make and question propose that this house do now wood the austerity programme have be one of the most damaging policy our country have see in decade and one statistic demonstrate its complete failure there be more than excess death between and more than people die as result of austerity they be human being with family and friend like we they have aspiration and dream but now they be go perhaps because of decision make in departments and in this house that be an injustice after all the first duty of the british government be to keep their citizen safe and the country secure be those people keep safe evidently they be not that be the sort of statistic that future generation will read and wonder how on earth we could have allow it to happen the subject of my debate be fiscal policy and the pandemic but what want to get at be the extent to which austerity leave we unprepared for the pandemic start with that statistic to present the situation in britain prior to the outbreak of the virus my speech will discuss healthcare and the minister may think what this get to do with the treasury hope that can convince he on that by say that our health service require money from his department because what matter about cut be their effect it be clear that the austerity programme hollow out our welfare state include the nhs to be ready for pandemic we need strong healthcare system but we just do not have that in be outrage by former prime minister david cameron and former chancellor george osborne at the covid inquiry they deny that their austerity programme have any impact on the pandemic and it be especially chilling watch george osborne their justification for austerity be at odd with scientific evidence and opinion which shall outline in their expert evidence to the inquiry last month professor clare bambra and professor sir michael marmot state that austerity policy have an adverse effect on health inequality that health inequality narrow in the period of high public expenditure from about to but widen again post commend the hon lady for secure this debate she be right to say that covid have affect health but it have also affect finance do she agree that will have ripple effect upon finance for year to come and that many people be now grapple with the reality of price increase at great rate than wage do she also agree that the government must take hold of the financial market once again with firm grasp and with strategy to help family in my constituency and her and indeed across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland thank the hon gentleman for that intervention and will come on to that issue in my speech he be completely right that there will be an ongoing impact on future generation not only from covid but from the impact on the public purse the scientific research also find that between and geographical inequality such as infant mortality rate and life expectancy be reduce but they then increase after why do that happen it be about money by after series of austerity budgets health spending be about billion below what it should have be have it match previous government commitment this far surpass the much vaunted cash injection of billion between and as part of the nhs long term plan that level be too little too late for what be to come the result of austerity be not hard to find right across the nhs with one of the more tangible measure be bed capacity between and the average daily total of available bed contract by bed britain have less than half the number of critical care bed relative to its population than the average in oecd european union nation austerity also mean year of pay cap and pay freeze in other word there be pay cut in real term for nhs worker they be earn thousand of pound less in real term in than in motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now wood look at the situation with the nightingale hospital they be good idea in theory but there be not enough worker available it be like sketch in yes hospital with no patient only in this case there be no worker either since the coalition government health and social care act which throw all the piece of the nhs up into the air no single entity have be responsible for workforce planning consequently staff over the past decade have be poor and disjoint and there have be lack of the staffing projection need to ensure we have enough health worker to meet demand so work become more intense with more turnover and more burnout this be before the pandemic and should have be warning signal to the government let we not forget the removal of the nurse bursary in which lead to decline in nursing application in the ensue year that have contribute to nursing number not keep pace with demand in the first quarter of the number of nursing vacancy increase to over know the government turn on that but why do it happen in the first place staff shortage put enormous pressure on nhs worker do not want to be too sentimental but do not know how they do it during the pandemic the demand put on those worker be enormous and the fortitude and resilience of nhs worker be remarkable in addition lack of personal protective equipment cause they huge level of stress risk their mental and physical health how about we start show bit of gratitude by give they the pay rise they have ask for public health which be such vital part of our defence have be the victim of toxic combination of austerity and ill thought through structural change as result we go into the pandemic with public health service that be ill equip to handle the arrival of covid as part of the coalition government reform public health function be separate from the nhs and put into local authority which and other member of the health system welcome between and the local authority public health grant fall by around quarter in real term between and public health england budget be cut by restructuring of the workforce result in experience bleed away the number of people work in public health be not enough to meet demand by england need almost more public health specialist to reach level recommend by the faculty of public health the voice and influence of public health specialist have be increasingly stifle and the value place in their expertise diminish britain be severely on the back foot when the pandemic hit we in early the nhs be operate without enough staff there be not enough bed and our building be outdate the failure to ensure that the nhs be properly staff and resource in the decade lead up to the pandemic mean that when the pandemic arrive there be no capacity to meet the increase in demand sickness absence from covid shrunk an already deplete workforce and the need to separate group of patient limit capacity far that mean drastic measure such as pause nearly all routine care in hospital redeploy staff and register medical student early there be no doubt that both staff and patient be put in harm way because of the historic underfunding under resourcing and austerity can the government say that they be not warn no they can not mp trade union and even the united nations all warn the government when the un say that the result of the austerity experiment be crystal our social security net have be tear asunder by austerity the government say that they regret the overtly political tone of the un report cameron and osborne project fail on its own term the book be not as they often tell we balanced in fact we be all bad off because of their action history will not absolve they because with austerity there be always price to pay thousand of people be dead and our welfare state be push to the brink austerity severely impact our response to the pandemic and it must never happen again the government have several fiscal event until the next election and they can change thing if they want to congratulate the hon member for city of durham mary kelly foy on secure this evening debate in debate the government fiscal policy as in so many thing it be all important to set out the context when the government be first elect it be in the immediate wake of the global financial crisis it be also after we inherit situation that have lead to the labour chief secretary to the treasury leave note we all remember that note that say there be be afraid no money leave in the year precede the pandemic the government fiscal strategy the only fiscal strategy be to reduce the deficit and debt that labour have leave we as long stand finance director myself before come to this place know that government need to live within their mean and show responsibility when entrust with people hard earn money that be the time to repair the nation finance before storm would strike when the deficit reach of gdp in government decision support its reduction to of gdp by that approach develop the financial buffer to help absorb the impact of future economic shock such as we see in the pandemic yet despite that period and rather belie what the hon lady say we have still be able to provide departmental spending today that will be around billion year more in real term by than in it be no wonder then that at the time when we take that approach it receive the support of parliament it be in line with the recommendation then for good practice for example the fiscal risk report of the independent office for budget responsibility say that the public finance need to be manage prudently during more favourable time to ensure that when these shock do crystallise they do not put the public finance onto an unsustainable path that be why when the pandemic hit we be well place to borrow to provide quick decisive and consistent support to household and business throughout the country which at that time have significant support from member on both side of the house estimate from the international monetary fund show that the uk discretionary fiscal expansion in response to the support that we give household be one of the large and most comprehensive financial support package globally to fund that response we have to borrow an additional billion huge amount of money across and but we could not have do that have we not make the difficult decision have we not act the cost to the country would have be far high member will remember the support that we provide include the furlough scheme which support nearly million job in total hold our economy together in incredibly tough time note that some of those job be in the north east and that since the pandemic have end the north east have have the third high increase in employee number relative to pre pandemic level the economy in the north east have be one of the fast growing also note that as be sadly so often the case on such occasion the hon member for city of durham have no alternative plan to lay out do not know whether she agree with the north of tyne mayor jamie driscoll who today say in respect of the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer you ve turn on so many promise in fact list of broken promise too long to repeat in this letter do not know whether she have see the letter from jamie driscoll or whether she agree with the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner or the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras on an issue like the two child policy our policy be clear do not think that it be appropriate for the opposition to hold two policy simultaneously in respect of the two child policy when we look back on the pandemic and on our fiscal approach both during and in the run up to it the government believe that we can be confident that we act responsibly we take difficult decision on the back of the financial situation that we inherit allow we when that terrible pandemic break above our head to protect livelihood up and down the country and ensure that we could afford to do so and could bounce back afterwards as we have do subsequently that was and remain sound responsible fiscal policy understand that not every member of this house will agree with the decision take hope that the hon member for city of durham will recognise that many people on both side of this house do their good in those most difficult time be quite surprised and confused give statistic about how many death there be and specialist across the board include the united nations have point out the damage do by the austerity programme have no idea why you mention the two child limit it would have be really helpful if you have stick to the point of my debate order the hon lady know that she must not address the minister directly will not delay we on the two child policy the labour party two policy policy perhaps it be detour too far for the hon lady make that point just to illustrate that these be difficult decision for those on both side of the house as it turn out recognise the hon lady passion and congratulate she again on secure the debate it be clearly topic that she rightly feel strongly about and apologise if have not fully address all her concern it be of course topic that the independent inquiry be address and and expect the house look forward to hear the outcome of that inquiry in due course question put and agree to house adjourn
