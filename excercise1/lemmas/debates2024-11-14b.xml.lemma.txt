minister have now admit that the government need to check their figure should the cost of the family farm tax to farming family not have be check before the budget the datum from his majesty revenue and customs be crystal clear three quarter of farmer will pay nothing as result of the change family farming will continue into future generation as it should the secretary of state perhaps need to ask his food minister why he say at the agricultural industries confederation conference that the government be check the figure let help the secretary of state out he can explain the veracity and accuracy of his figure next week when thousand of farmer come to westminster to rally against the family farm tax the delinking of payment the hike in national insurance and other tax hike on work farm in the budget will he come it be very important that the government listen to farmer and of course we will do so but know that farmer be reasonable people they will want to look at the fact and

in the agriculture budget worth more than on average for every single farm holding in the country what step be the secretary of state take to guarantee that every single penny of that budget get to community such as lichfield burntwood and the village my hon friend be absolutely right it be extraordinary give all the sound and fury from the opposition that they do not even spend the money that be available this government will ensure that every penny we have get to farmer because we be on the side of british farmer rather than whip they up in the kind of irresponsible way that the conservative party have be do family farm across west dorset fear closure as result of the government plan change to agricultural property relief and business property relief and urge minister to rethink the policy the budget also include the announcement of uk carbon border adjustment mechanism to be introduce on january that will place carbon price on good import to the uk include fertiliser carbon tax on fertiliser will only increase the cost of production for farmer struggle to compete with cheap import and drive up cost for consumer what assessment have be make of that the proposal for carbon border adjustment mechanism be support by the previous government and we have confirm it it be complicated in the way it will work and it will not affect people before the liberal democrats have show once again that when it come to environmental issue they can not be trust resident in woodborough village have face the devastation of flood far too many time in recent year will my right

that it do in species conservation will endeavour to write to my hon friend to update he on the regulation the government have justify their inheritance tax change for farmer on the basis that they be concerned about people gain short term tax advantage by buy agricultural land may therefore ask whether instead of the sweeping change that they make the government consider an approach that would

why not we have have lot of debate about this issue and be perfectly happy to have discussion with hon member about the tax regime in general one of the beneficial aspect of this policy may be to get

more effectively with members of parliament in the area that they represent this week john mcternan an adviser to tony blair publicly state that farming should be treat in the same way that margaret thatcher treat the miner and that it be an industry the country could do without as farmer find this incorrect offensive and delude do the minister agree yes solicitor general the solicitor general be

government be in hurry we have already implement ban on the possession of zombie style knife and machete but of course there be lot more that we can and should be do council tax urgent question to ask the secretary of state for housing communities and local government if she will make statement on the government policy on council tax referendum threshold in since the financial year local authority fire authority and police and crime commissioner have be require to determine whether the amount of council tax they plan to raise be excessive the secretary of state set threshold on excessiveness and know the referendum principle for different class of authority since those threshold have also include social care precept provide high threshold for authority with social care responsibility decision on the council tax level to set or whether to hold referendum to go beyond the referendum principle sit with council but the government have be clear that we expect the threshold to be maintain at the current level set by the previous government the office for budget responsibility forecast of the last government assume that council tax would increase by core plus an additional for local authority with adult social care responsibility for the entirety of the forecast period we will set out further detail in the local government finance settlement in the new year beyond that we be determined to support local government and undo the mess that have be create over the past year that be why at the budget we announce over billion in new local government funding include an additional billion in the local government finance settlement that as the hon gentleman will be well aware have be warmly welcome by the sector council tax fund about billion of expenditure in england on social care which be of all council funding it be therefore of huge interest to our constituent the prime minister and ministers have repeatedly tell the house that we need to wait for the spending review and the local government finance settlement to know what will happen with the referendum limit include at the dispatch box yesterday when the prime minister tell my right hon friend the leader of the opposition to wait shortly afterwards the press be tell that the limit would remain in place answer to parliamentary question show that the government be expect spending power to increase by billion fund by grant of billion that demonstrate that the chancellor budget have open up billion black hole in council finance in addition to that the county councils network have highlight its concern that although we have not yet have formal statement in the house there be proposal to change the way in which funding be allocate far deprive local authority in urban suburban and rural area of the funding that they need would like to put two question to the minister first will he promise the house that fund allocation through the grant mechanism will follow the cost pressure on local authority and not any other form of indexation or formula to ensure that place face the high cost receive the funding that they need next while nobody would want to see the referendum limit scrap simply to bail out central government the announcement of the constrain local authority when it come to their fundraising will the minister tell the house whether it will be our high street through increase business rate or whether significant cut to other council service will be need to fill the government billion black hole thank the hon gentleman for his question let take they in turn the government be commit to fair funding settlement for local government we will set out further detail in the usual way in the upcoming local government finance settlement which will be present to parliament on the billion figure be afraid that we simply do not recognise it assume that the hon gentleman in his calculation fail to take account of the over million raise from business rate and million in additional new house come along yes it be right that billion will be raise through council tax in but as make clear that be because the government be clear that we be maintain the previous government policy on council tax in line with the obr forecast make in march the question for the opposition be be they say that the cap should be abolish as the conservative local government association group rebuild the road to victory document call for all cap to be remove or be they say that the limit should be reduce which would be contrary to the policy in place when the now leader of the opposition be the local government minister call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee it be worth remember why number of our local authority be face this decision and the tight financial situation the funding crisis over the past year force number of local authority to make those difficult decision number of our area be face major in year cost pressure from thing such as temporary accommodation and special educational need and disability provision do the minister agree that we need to accelerate the house building plan in order to get local authority back on level playing field so that our local resident do not see that cost increase in their council tax bill thank the chair of the select committee for that question she be absolutely right after year of the previous government record in office local government be on its knee we have system on the verge of collapse we have multiple year when in year spending pressure be ignore the headroom that we have provide through the budget more than billion in new local government funding which reference early will allow we to start to turn that system around and to get ahead of some of the challenge we be face whether the pressure on adult social care child service or homelessness cost as result of temporary accommodation that be why our house building programme within my specific remit of responsibility and in particular the increase in social and affordable housing supply that we be commit to be so important call the liberal democrat spokesperson the liberal democrats be deeply concerned that people be simply pay more council tax for few service that be quite clearly the result of conservative tax cut and their failure to tackle social care as former council leader know that the burden on council have increase to such an extent that they be force to make impossible choice the burden and the cost that council of all colour have to shoulder as result of the conservative government policy must be review will the minister ensure that council do not have to close library cut bus route and reduce road repair in order to meet the grow demand of the most vulnerable member of our community despite the announcement in the budget will the minister recognise the lga analysis that council face billion shortfall because of inflation increase wage demand and demand pressure on local service the government certainly recognise the pressure on local authority and the burden place on household as result of year in which local government be run down we be determined to turn that situation around as have say by provide the headroom that local authority need to get ahead of some of the challenge that they have face for many year that be why the more than billion in new local government funding announce at the budget include an additional million in the local government finance settlement have be so warmly welcome that bring the total real term increase in core spending to around we remain committed to the referendum cap we believe that be the right threshold to protect the most vulnerable we be also committed to the single person discount and local council tax support scheme under which as be sure the hon gentleman be aware more than million household do not pay full council tax bill really do not know how the opposition spokesperson the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds can stand there and talk about cut and shortfall with straight face we know where responsibility lie and on the lib dem benches as well interruption order think that the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake will want that yorkshire cup of tea it will come very quickly if he carry on call clive betts another yorkshireman let take my hon friend on trip down memory lane when first become councillor only year ago council have the freedom to raise rate for domestic and non domestic property should we not at some point start conversation with council and the wide public about whether threshold at all be appropriate council in this country have less freedom to raise local taxation than virtually any other council in western europe council tax itself be regressive both between individual and between different local authority can we not start that conversation at some point thank my hon friend for that point and will relay it to the local government minister on the general principle we be determined to rebuild local government from the ground up that be why we be provide multi year funding settlement to council and remove number of ringfence and be commit as say to fair funding on his general point about the opposition completely agree it remind of phrase my nan use to use more front than harrods she use to say that be what opposition member have will the minister rule out additional council tax band be among any change that the government make say to the right hon gentleman that we be not talk about council tax band in this urgent question we be talk about the threshold that remain in place we be committed to those threshold as be sure you would expect mr speaker we will set out more detail about the local government finance settlement at the appropriate point next year in the usual way area like hull city council be savage by the previous government when it come to funding absolutely savaged to the point where they be almost on their knee will my hon friend the minister tell the house what the government be do for area of high deprivation like hull my hon friend be absolutely right the damage do to local government over the year in which the conservatives be in office be profound we have inherit as say system on the verge of collapse we be absolutely committed as part of rebuild that system from the ground up to fair funding settlement as say the minister for local government will announce more detail in the upcoming local government finance settlement in the new year local authority across the country will welcome multi year settlement so they can plan for the future however do the minister have any plan whatever for revaluation of property give that property be originally value back in when council tax begin the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts and produce select committee report on what could be do to ensure that council need not be strictly neutral in term of finance and could revalue property to bring valuation up to date the hon gentleman tempt to discuss the local government finance settlement ahead of it be formally present to the house be afraid can not do that but the government have hear his point and will ensure that it be pass on to the local government minister as councillor see year of austerity and cut to local government and cut equivalent for my council in medway the opposition the medway conservative group recently state that it would not only scrap the recent council tax cap but introduce local income tax on resident do the minister agree that there need to be consistency on this issue whereas the opposition approach be to say in one case scrap the cap and in another keep it my hon friend be absolutely right and we still have not have an answer we do not know the opposition position on threshold interruption we be in government as the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake chunter from sedentary position and we have confirm that when it come to threshold we intend to maintain the position as it be under the previous government and as bake into the office for budget responsibility forecast for the spending period the opposition really do have to answer this question be they say that the threshold should be remove or increase or be they say that they should be reduce and core service cut unfortunately it be not for the opposition to answer the question they be in opposition the chancellor and the international monetary fund be know to favour end council tax and replace it with wide property tax the welsh labour government try to revalue all the property in wales for council tax purpose can the government rule out do either of those thing be not go to get into speculate about more fundamental reform of the council tax system as have in number of my response to this urgent question the government will set out their position on the threshold and on other matter in respect of the local government finance settlement at the appropriate point early in the new year york be the lowest fund unitary authority in the country but have one of the high cost of living that put real pressure on it we be also among the poorest fund for health fire and police service when the minister look at the funding formula for local government will he look at the presumption make to ensure more equity in the way it be put together as have say repeatedly commit to it again we be determined to ensure that there be fair funding settlement for local government and as have say more detail will be forthcoming in the settlement early next year labour use to say that it would freeze council tax can the minister now confirm that its policy be actually to put council tax up because of the flawed broken promise on national insurance no that be not the case we be maintain the policy of the previous government which as per the obr forecast estimate that billion will be raise through council tax the position of the government be that it will maintain the threshold if the hon gentleman think differently he should tell house what his position be on threshold should they be reduce or increase be pleased about the support for first and second tier council and the commitment to fair funding which will make real difference in for instance cornwall however in unitary authority such as our where great many service have be share large town council have have to step up and take the strain but have not have the grant and other measure that have be available to those first and second tier council could the appropriate minister meet to discuss the position of large town council in cornwall be more than happy to commit the local government minister to meeting with my hon friend during prime minister question yesterday the government accept that they be give council maximum of million but the local government association have say that there be billion worth of pressure do the minister accept that council will have to increase their tax by about billion to fill the gap between what the government be offer they and what they need to provide local service as have make clear we do not recognise the billion figure it fail to take into account increase that have already mention such as the million increase in business rate income and the million increase in income from new additional house the hon gentleman be absolutely right that we expect council tax to raise billion in but that be in line with the previous government spending plan and bake into the obr forecast as of march as former deputy council leader be somewhat amazed by the collective amnesia of conservative members the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds speak of what constrain local government spending power do my hon friend agree that it be cut such as those that southampton city council have suffer for year that have really reduce that spend power and do he agree that rather than faux outrage what we need be an apology absolutely agree with my hon friend we deserve an apology but doubt that we will get one before it be vanishingly rare for council to fall into serious financial difficulty since then nine council have be affect in just year there be pattern here for too long the conservative government not only fail to carry out their duty to local government but hollow out frontline service and crash the economy we be turn that around with the support that we be provide to local government in the budget we will set out more detail in the local government settlement early next year as have mention as the minister will know although we do not have council tax per se in northern ireland the pressure on our family finance be on par with those on the uk mainland the government need to be clear about just how much furth the finance of average family will be stretch because this be very worrying trend what extra help can family especially disabled family expect to receive this year thank the hon gentleman for his question which relate to an early one think that in the urgent question the opposition fail to account for the various other source of support that we be provide for family we be continue the household support fund that is billion there be billion uplift for special educational need there be uk share prosperity funding of million the list go on but if the hon gentleman wish to discuss the specific condition in northern ireland far be more than happy to pass on that request to the local government minister refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be vice president of the local government association opposition front benchers might want to reflect on that my hon friend mention front could talk about the opposition brass neck in talk about concern about the pressure that local council face do he agree that year of conservative austerity initially with the liberal democrats devastate the ability of many council include luton council to provide need service to family in our constituency have be local councillor as have many member of this house the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds have be council leader so he will know what have happen to the system over the past year the opposition continue to claim that there be multibillion pound black hole in local council budget when ask how they would fix it however they say it not for we to do we in opposition it for the government it be classic policy of have no plan to fix the mess they have provide no clarity on their position on threshold and fail to take responsibility for what they do over year in government my conservative control council in the london borough of bexley have to apply for capitalisation order three year ago and make of our staff redundant despite that it still overspent its budget every month for over two year and be currently overspend on the safety valve agreement make with the previous government in addition the conservative leader of the council in respond to question from last year accept that she be part of the lga conservative group executive that publish manifesto last year ask their own government to remove cap on council tax give that do my hon friend agree that it be rank hypocrisy for the conservative party to complain now about black hole in council finance absolutely do and the government be determined to extract from the opposition some clarity on their position on threshold do they agree with the lga conservative group which have call for the cap on council tax to be remove do they want those cap to be reduce we be still none the wiser hopefully we can find out in the week and month to come as member of council for more than year like other member of this house be still one have to say that in the last few year have not meet single councillor from any political party across the local government family who do not believe that local government finance be in its bad state for decade the late lga figure indicate that in labour authority council tax be low than in conservative authority do the minister agree that this show that labour council the labour party and the labour government provide well value for money my hon friend be absolutely right labour council charge less on average than tory council and the council with the low rate of council tax be all labour council tax bill in labour council be on average less than in tory council when it come to local government financing and council tax pressure people be right to vote labour it will ensure that their council tax be low than if they be under conservative local authority be former local government leader do the minister agree that we should thank local authority leader especially labour leader such as pete marland at milton keynes city council for keep service during year of austerity milton keynes city council have keep weekly bin collection keep child centre open and reduce rough sleeping while keep council tax lower than in its neighbouring tory authority do the minister agree that instead of use local authority leader to make cheap political point the conservative party should thank they and apologise for year of austerity my hon friend make good point extend the government appreciation to all local government leader mean that in cross party spirit for what they have do to keep service go despite the pressure that they have face over the past year when the previous government run down local government we should thank local government leader and this government do we want to consult they on how we rebuild the system after year of pressure and we would be more than happy to work across the chamber and have mature cross party conversation about we fix this mess that will not happen if the political game playing from the opposition continue national insurance contributions healthcare urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make statement on the impact of change to employer national insurance contribution on primary care provider hospice and care home be grateful to the hon member for ask this important question it give the opportunity to say to gps dentist hospice and every part of the health and care system that will be affect by change to employer national insurance contribution that this government understand the pressure they face and take their representation seriously the chancellor take into account the impact of change to national insurance when she allocate an extra billion to the department of health and social care there be well establish process for agree funding allocation across the system and we be go through those process now with this issue in mind this government inherit billion black hole in the public finance broken public service and stagnant economy upon take office we be tell that the deficit the previous government recklessly run up in my department alone would mean deliver few appointment week instead of the more we promise the chancellor and my right hon friend the secretary of state be not prepared to see further decline in our nhs that be why we put in an extra billion to stop the nhs go into reverse this year we build on that at the budget deliver the significant investment that the nhs need to get back on its foot back staff with investment in modern technology new scanner and new surgical hub and rebuild our crumble primary and secondary care estate alongside that we deliver real term increase in core local government spending power of around which will help to address the range of pressure face the adult social care sector include million in new grant funding for social care we be now work through exactly how that money will be allocate as per normal process as the secretary of state set out yesterday we will ensure that every pound be invest wisely to deliver the government priority and provide value to taxpayer the department will set out further detail on the allocation of funding in due course include through nhs planning guidance and the usual consultation include on the general practice contract as part of these process we will consider the impact of change announce to employer national insurance contribution in fair and open way over the next five month before the change come into force in april draw the house attention to my declaration of interest many in the health sector will have be pleased to hear the announcement of the extra funding for the nhs only for their joy to be strike down by the realisation that manifesto promise not to raise national insurance contribution have be break that be compound far by the discovery that raft of frontline care provider care home hospice care charity pharmacy and gps to name but few will not be exempt from the ni rise leave they with crippling staff bill and the threat of closure and redundancy the hospice sector expect the cost to be million closure and redundancy the initial assessment of the cost to gps be million closure and redundancy at the expense of million appointment for the care sector the change will cost billion dwarf the million in social care support that be announce do the minister accept that it be inevitable that council tax will have to rise to support the increase in nic for the first time the national pharmacy association have announce collective action its chair say the sense of anger among pharmacy owner have be intensify exponentially by the budget with its hike in national insurance employer contribution and the unfunded national living wage increase which have tip even more pharmacy to the brink will the minister clarify who be exempt from ni will the government admit that they get it wrong and make change the prime minister health secretary and chancellor have all say that allocation will be make in the usual way will the minister clarify what the usual way be will mitigation be put in black and white to the house and the public be this part of the billion or new funding more importantly will the minister lie out concrete timetable for hospice care home gps pharmacist and all other ally health professional who be make decision now this seem to be another example of big headline from the labour party but no detail well really be quite dumbfound by the hon gentleman response respect he for his professional practice and he know the state of the nhs that we inherit from the previous government as report in lord darzi report he talk about joy but there be no joy when we inherit the mess they leave back in july he talk about people be tip to the brink and they absolutely be as lord darzi make clear as say we will go through the allocation of additional funding in the normal process which will be fast than under the previous government because we be commit to give the sector much more certainty the normal process as the hon gentleman should know from his time in government be to go through the mandate and the planning guidance and to talk to the sector about the allocation due next april as say in my opening statement do my hon friend join in welcome the opposition new interest in social care do she far agree that the problem that social care face owe more to the previous government failure to do anything with andrew dilnot report than they do to anything that be happen now with national insurance my hon friend make an excellent point when join this house in remember that the first act of the new non coalition conservative government be to take the leg from underneath that social care commitment by postpone the care act they cynically say at the time that they would bring it forward by which they think would coincide with the next general election we all see how that go call the liberal democrat spokesperson the increase in employer national insurance contribution will erode the very investment in the nhs that the budget seek to prioritise katie gp from lindfield in mid sussex write to say that the nics increase serve to directly undermine access and patient care the government have promise to recruit more gps but hike national insurance put that pledge in jeopardy surgery be set to see eye watering increase in staff cost equivalent to appointment in west sussex alone gps will have no choice but to cut service and staff number and patient will pay the price do the minister agree that strong primary care with fast appointment and few people have to go to hospital be well for both the nhs and patient if so will she protect service and press the chancellor to end this gp penalty the hon lady make an excellent point about the importance of gps and primary care to the wide sector immediately after take office this summer we free up the system to employ extra gps through the additional role reimbursement scheme which the previous government refuse to implement because we recognise the need for that extra capacity we will be talk to general practice as part of the contract reform over the next few month follow the normal process to determine allocation for next year if this government ambition stem from lord darzi report be to be realise significant investment be require not only in primary care but in third sector organisation however these organisation be concerned about the increase cost pressure on their service will the minister ensure that there be sufficient support within the trickle down approach which the department will now have to apply to maintain current service level and facilitate the urgently need transition across health service respect my hon friend expertise in this area she be right and we understand that the pressure be real which be why we have commit to support the nhs and the social care system with the additional funding that my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care secure as part of the budget settlement we be also work closely with the nhs in new relationship to understand its need that be dynamic conversation because we want to understand what be happen in local system as we continue to invest in they call the father of the house we all know that lot of the debate on assist die revolve around the lack of hospice place to help people pass in the good way possible similarly much of the debate on the nhs be about the lack of care home space leave aside the cross party name calling may beg the minister to consider exempt hospice and care home from this national insurance increase understand the right hon gentleman point as have say we will continue our conversation with all affected provider in the normal way do the minister agree that the support that we will put in place for general practice and in particular the community health hub that be recently announce will be crucial to the improvement in the health service that we urgently need respect my hon friend expertise and service to the national health service he will understand the need to make the shift into neighbourhood health service we have be clear that we will ensure the nhs spend all its allocation in the most effective way to enable that shift as part of our year plan trustee of the hamelin trust not for profit provider of care and support across essex have contact because he be concerned about the rise in national insurance that hamelin will have to pay because of the measure introduce by the government he say this will affect what they can do to support our community and subsequently put more pressure on the nhs and local authority the impact on disabled people and old adult who rely on regular consistent high quality care will be profound do not believe that the government intend to hammer the disabled or old people who need care so will the minister prove right and look at the policy again the right hon gentleman be part of the last government be pleased to note that he be talk to his new constituent the billion black hole and the report from lord darzi indicate the fragility of the system we have inherit we be ensure that vulnerable group be support through the allocation provide to both the department for health and social care and the department for work and pensions when labour come into government in july every element of our health service be in crisis since then we have announce record investment in our national health service but be yet to hear whether the conservative party support that record investment do the minister agree that the government be listen to health professional take tough decision and not simply play politic my hon friend make an excellent point we have still not hear from the opposition whether they agree with the extra investment that have go into the sector or with lord darzi report that diagnose their legacy include why they leave that legacy and the serious issue we now have to address shooting star child hospice in hampton serve child with life limit condition and support their family not just in my constituency but across south west london and surrey with the national insurance hike it face bill of on top of all the inflationary cost that it have have to absorb it be also wait for confirmation as to whether the child hospice grant which this year provide it with million will continue beyond april will the minister commit to make hospice exempt from the ni rise not just for nursing staff but for all staff and when will she be able to give shooting star and other child hospice confirmation on whether the child hospice grant will continue they need to plan now commend the hon lady for raise the great work do by hospice we understand the pressure and the precarious situation that many have be leave in after year of the last government we be willing and keen to talk to representative from all type of hospice and other we be go through the process of the allocation and we will be able to get back to they as soon as possible hundred of my constituent in leeds south west and morley be stick on record long waiting list thank to the conservative party it be essential that we get those waiting list down because they have profound effect on our economy and on the health of those wait will the minister confirm that the measure that we set out in the budget will provide the additional appointment need to get those waiting list down my hon friend make an excellent point as say in my response to the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans we face situation where we be tell that we would have to reduce appointment by week we have take serious step and my right hon friend the secretary of state fight hard for our budget allocation so that we can have extra appointment as promise in our manifesto which be overwhelmingly endorse by the british public we be determined that we will bring change to the system and tackle the waiting list increase taxis for hospice care home gps and pharmacy be that deliberate decision by the labour government or just cock up we understand the precarious situation that hospice be in the precarious situation that they find themselves in before we come to power and we be commit to talk to they and other affected provider we will be go through the normal process of allocation in the next few month many of my constituent continue to wait on record long waiting list do the minister agree that before the opposition throw stone we should remind the house that their spending plan would have cut billion from the nhs which would have completely shatter an already break nhs those conservative members who have hold on to their seat have be in that situation as well know that the public staff and patient understand exactly what state they leave the nhs in that be why they have such disastrous election result we be determined to change the nhs and to make it fit for the century part of what we have do in this budget through that extra allocation our conversation with those in the health and social care system and our year plan will do just that while scotland public sector be face million bill for the chancellor reckless national insurance hike scotland charity include hospice face million price tag under these change the budget simply can not be balance on the back of scotland charity and hospice this be disgraceful decision for which the labour government be rightly be hound there be still time for they to do the right thing and cover these cost agree with what the father of the house say will the minister tell we whether they will do so the snp have be in charge in scotland for something like year now forget exactly how long but it seem like very long time again the scottish people give we an excellent result at the general election and be delighted to have so many scottish colleague here with now however the snp have the opportunity to make decision in scotland around health and social care as well so suggest that they do well job it be disappointing to put it mildly that the opposition spokesperson be unable to mention the record funding commit in the budget it be in my opening line order the shadow minister have be grant an urgent question he ask the question he do not answer they from the front bench do the minister agree that it be also disappointing that the opposition ignore the fact that they completely disregard and ignore social care when they be in office the government have no responsibility for that well do agree with my hon friend as have say when become member of parliament in remember very clearly the absolute shock that feel when the conservative immediately announce that they be not go to meet the commitment that they have make to implement the care act at that time and we be still play catch up on that issue doctor from duns galashiels selkirk kelso and across the scottish borders have contact about the impact that this national insurance hike will have on their practice they tell that the decision will be huge retrograde step for primary care will have huge financial impact on their practice and will undermine access to primary and patient care why have the labour government make this choice to hammer local doctor as have say we have make commitment to general practice and primary care by release extra gps into the system we recognise the situation in which gps find themselves know this because work with gp practice in my previous career we need those practice to be the foundation of our neighbourhood service which be why we will talk in the normal process about the allocation over the next few month as part of the contract if we be to reform the nhs we need to move resource over time into primary care the reality be that gps see at first instance of patient but receive only of nhs funding will my hon friend ensure that in the settlement that be agree with nhs provider particular attention be give to support gps on the social care sector when we help the hospice and social care provider which be charity and small organisation in particular can perhaps do so without subsidise some of the hedge fund that be now invest heavily in social care we do not want to add to their profit while support the small charity involve my hon friend have lead fantastic work in previous parliaments on the health and social care system which he understand very well he make an excellent point about ensure that additional funding go where we want it to which be towards support our constituent particularly with social care we have all see the situation over the last decade over so improve that be critical to the urgent and emergency care system and to the dignity of those people who need the service we will continue to talk to they and to local system about the impact of any change hear what the minister say about the government want to stop the nhs go into reverse but that be exactly what risk happen to gp practice in my constituency meet with one on friday that tell that as consequence of have to find extra fund for national insurance contribution it will no long be able to make permanent temporary support post or proceed with the recruitment of the extra gp that it want to take on there be contradiction at the heart of the rule gps be treat as private contractor but if they be private contractor they would be eligible for employment allowance because their work be entirely in the public sector they can not get it surely something have to give the right hon gentleman tempt to go into my previous career work with gps and their employment and contractual status but will not do that now mr speaker as you would rightly curtail gps have complicated contractual status that have be long in the process we understand the precariousness of primary care gps be crucial to our plan for develop the health service and we will discuss with they in the normal process the allocation for the following year last month budget finally give my constituent hope that there will be an nhs that work for they will my hon friend assure that this government will avoid the sticking plaster piecemeal approach of the last government and bring forward long term plan to fix the nhs for the future my hon friend be right get away from short term fix and stick plaster be exactly what we be attempt to do that be why we put in the extra security of extra gps over the summer commit to extra funding in the budget and launch our year plan encourage all hon member and their constituent to submit their view to that exercise at dr aleksandra fox of the ash surgery in my constituency be one of number of gps who have point out to the deleterious effect of an ill thought through budget in addition charity such as shooting star and demelza child hospice be face problem now they can not wait for discussion through the normal channel while this cock up be put right when will something be do about it please the right hon gentleman say that it be an ill thought through budget do not know whether he agree or disagree with the extra funding that the government have commit to the nhs after the disaster of the last year this morning we learn that the scottish government have waste million of taxpayer money on the flawed ill conceive national care service scotland bill which do not command the support of almost any of the stakeholder need to pass it do my hon friend agree that the additional funding for the nhs that have be commit to in our labour budget should be use to come up with proper plan for social care across the uk that do not follow the flawed approach in scotland be so pleased to see my hon friend in her place as say to the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan the snp have be in charge of scotland for very long time we have certainly miss have scottish labour voice in this place she make an excellent point and shin some sunlight in this place on the action that have be take up in holyrood julia house hospice do amazing work across wiltshire and dorset but its chief executive martin edwards come to parliament on tuesday to tell that the additional national insurance contribution will cost the hospice year for that hospice and naomi house which do similar good work the change be significant concern know that the people of wiltshire and dorset will do as much as they can to raise additional fund but will the minister reflect on that unexpected gap and offer some reassurance agree with the right hon gentleman that his hospice and the hospice in many of our constituency do great work we be aware of the precarious situation that they have be in for number of year and we want to ensure that they be fully part of end of life care he will know from his time in the treasury that there be complicated process both in the treasury and in the department of health and social care when talk about the normal process for allocate money think he understand that well we be mindful of hospice concern and we will continue to talk with they between and during the conservatives time in government the number of general practice fall from to do my hon friend agree that it be bit rich for the conservatives to pretend now that they care so much about general practice give that practice close on their watch my hon friend bring great deal of expertise to the house from her work in social care so she know and understand the precarious nature of the sector which we can not stress enough do not know whether the conservatives have actually read the report by lord darzi but that report and its appendix give really clear idea and diagnosis of the state in which the nhs and social care system be leave it will take long time to rebuild it and the sustainability of general practice and primary care be particularly problematic that be why we take those action in the summer and why we will continue to support they and build up neighbourhood health service the minister will understand that gps be private contractor to the health service as be pharmacist hospice and many wonderful charity the government have decide to ensure that the public sector be protect from the national insurance increase all that the minister or her secretary of state need to do be agree that all the supplier to the national health service be also protect which would safeguard their position otherwise care home will close down pharmacy will close down and hospice will not be able to provide their service my constituency have the wonderful st luke hospice which do brilliant work help to found it back in the and which have tell that it will have to reduce service drastically as result of the change whenever nurse and other medical practitioner get pay rise those supplier have have to cope without be give the money to fund that pay rise they need to be protect from that as well thank the hon gentleman for his comment and for support his local hospice he be an experienced parliamentarian he know that this be not simple and that the provider landscape be complicated as we hear from my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts large private equity company own many social care provider we want to ensure that any additional funding from the budget go exactly where it need to be support patient our constituent where they live and need care that be why over the next few month we will continue to talk to provider in the usual way about the allocation of those fund since the budget have be contact by gps care provider and charity in my constituency all express concern about the impact of the rise in employer nic on their ability to serve the most vulnerable in our community will the minister reconsider the change by find way to exempt the charitable sector in the same way as the public sector have write to ministers and table early day motion on this issue will she take this opportunity to assure the charitable sector that it will not be impact by the measure the hon lady tempt to make specific commitment which be not prepared to do as be sure she understand she be right that people be express concern about some of these decision that be because they be in such precarious situation as result of what we have inherit from the past year as the prime minister and the rest of the government have be clear throughout the election and afterwards we have year plan because it will take long time to fix the foundation and build up the sector to make it more resilient and sustain it for the future we want to fix those foundation and we will talk closely with everyone affect over the come month but this will take long time those provider be precarious because of the mess that we inherit early this week receive letter from the lincolnshire and nottinghamshire air ambulance charitable healthcare provider the national insurance change will add year to its cost and if it be force to close life will be lose may urge the minister know she will want to protect this service to do all she can to ensure that that air ambulance and other across the country be not hit by this tax assure the hon gentleman that since we be elect the government have already take action to secure extra investment in the health and social care system and we be commit to build thriving health and social care system for the rest of the century rural pharmacy one of the few remain in my constituency derive of its turnover from provide nhs service will the minister consider give pharmacist for whom nhs service account for such large proportion of their work an exemption from the nics rise what assessment have the government make of the impact on the continue delivery of programme such as pharmacy first if pharmacist have to shut their door the hon gentleman make an excellent point about pharmacy we absolutely understand their importance both in urban constituency such as mine and in rural area remember from when become an mp in the change that the previous government make to the pharmacy contract and be aware of the precarious situation that pharmacist have be in we will continue to talk to they as part of the normal process but we understand how important they be to build neighbourhood service and to the future of the nhs acorns child hospice st richard hospice and gps care home and pharmacy across west worcestershire have all be in touch with concern about the extra cost burden that the government have impose on they can the minister explain how it fit in with her strategic plan to slap extra cost on the community sector while rebate the nhs trust sector be sure that all those hospice which do great work be also in touch with the hon lady when she be part of the previous government she will know from her time on the treasury committee that follow the budget we go through the planning guidance and have conversation with all core contract sector that be part of the normal process we be absolutely committed to build back the foundation of the nhs and social care system make it fit for the century and create year plan to which we want everyone to contribute community and neighbourhood system be fundamental part of that gps pharmacy and social care home from across ceredigion preseli have contact to express their concern about the impact of the policy change surround employer national insurance contribution it be essential that they be support with the cost that come from this policy the minister have suggest that there might be additional support for some of they through the usual system will she clarify whether that will mean funding be find from the department budget or whether there will be additional new money from the treasury that would have certain ramification for the welsh government and whether they get additional barnett formula funding understand the concern of the provider that have come to the hon gentleman and he be right to raise they in this place as he know health and social care be devolve to the welsh government and there have be much benefit already from the barnett consequential of the budget we will continue to talk to the devolved region in may say much more co operative way than the previous government do to ensure that we have good system across the entire united kingdom in tweet to the health secretary caroline rayment who be the clinical lead for the wharfedale and silsden community partnership say you come to our practice in june and tell we you want to support the family costs for the nmw and ni will come to approx we be small practice of patient how be this help we can the minister answer caroline question be not abreast of all the health secretary tweet and the response to they but caroline make point that have be make by many people in the chamber today as well as number of provider as say in my opening statement we understand the precarious situation that those provider have be put in because of the failure of the past year and the billion black hole that the government have inherit as my hon friend the member for shipley anna dixon say general practice have be put in precarious situation over the past year with thousand of practice go bust and give back their contract that be situation that we promise the british public we would change and we will do so in suffolk the national insurance increase create million of additional pressure on adult social care alone do not think the minister understand that she be not just engage in some party political knockabout with conservative members gps hospice care home and pharmacy be watch this debate and be look to the minister for answer they know that this problem be cause by the government tax rise which be be implement without plan for they so can she tell they when solution be go to be bring forward by the government when be they go to get reassurance about their future the hon gentleman may or may not think that this be political knockabout but be very clear in my opening statement that we understand the pressure that the sector be under we understand the mess that we inherit and we be fix it we be work with social care gps provider and hospice that be affect by any change in the budget and we will continue to talk to they in the usual way we be committed to do this fast than the last government do it under the last government plan guidance and commitment to the nhs be always run late they be always play catch up we be committed to make sure that the sector be much more sustainable so that it can do the important job we be ask it to do call jim shannon thank you madam deputy speaker as member know be the last person when be call the debate be almost over will the minister confirm whether consideration have be give to the fact that the rise in national insurance contribution will not affect the nhs as whole as the block grant for we in northern ireland will cover it however gp practice in my constituency of strangford will suffer and unlike high street business or manufacturing they can not increase price to cover that impending rise leave practice with no option other than to reduce hour in order to stay solvent do the minister agree that this be the last thing already overstretch gp practice need and will she commit to take this issue back to the treasury for reconsideration as it relate to healthcare business such as gps dentist and pharmacy as the hon gentleman know health and social care be devolved issue we will continue to work closely with all the devolved area because we think that that be important unlike the last labour government the last conservative government laughter slip there almost get through we absolutely understand the precarious nature of general practice and in particular understand the really serious issue around health and social care in northern ireland the hon gentleman know that and he make good case for the sector we want to ensure that it support people in northern ireland with the good primary and community care they deserve business of the house will the leader of the house present the forthcoming business the business for the week commence november include monday november second reading of the armed forces commissioner bill tuesday november consideration of lords amendment to the passenger railway services public ownership bill follow by general debate on the infected blood inquiry wednesday november second reading of the financial assistance to ukraine bill thursday november debate on

reading of the non domestic rating multipliers and private schools bill tuesday november second reading of the tobacco and vapes bill wednesday november second reading of the finance bill thursday november business to be determine by the backbench business committee friday november private member bills call the shadow leader of the house thank you very much indeed madam deputy speaker be sure that the whole house will want to join in wish very happy birthday today to his majesty the king the last few day in global politic have be extraordinary feature one of the most incredible comeback of modern time it be wildly hard to predict many people have panic at the possible consequence and some be still in state of denial but even so must say that be delighted to have be appoint as shadow leader of the house of commons pay tribute to my immediate predecessor the luke skywalker of the conservative party my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp and the great obi wan jedi sabre wield master or mistress of the despatch box herself the former member for portsmouth north penny mordaunt as it be with the galactic empire so it be with the labour party recent event have remind we of the truth of the ancient saying power reveal so it be with this new government what have their first chaotic few month in office reveal first we know that they like to say one thing and do another they talk about support work people but the rise in national insurance will hit all work people they talk about growth but have impose the large tax rise for generation push up both interest rate and inflation only last week we see report rise in company file for insolvency compare with the same week last year and that be before all the red tape of the new employment rights bill which will make it hard than ever to give somebody job and grow business madam deputy speaker there be so much sheer incompetence here to take one example the government have raise employer national insurance lower the income threshold and increase the minimum wage all at the same time no one seem to have notice that the combined effect of those measure be to raise the cost of hire an entry level employee not by but by something close to that be terrible blow especially to the retail and hospitality sector ask the leader of the house be that deliberate or just mistake will she ask the treasury to publish an assessment of the total impact of those three measure before any legislation come to this house secondly we know that the government be willing even keen to play the politic of division they have favour public sector worker over private sector one they have drive away entrepreneur and business creator as we have hear this morning they have be punitive on rural area the rise in national insurance put huge pressure on already struggle rural gps care home dentist pharmacist and hospice mental health and disability charity have already express their deep concern we hear from the dispatch box just now that the government hear the concern but if they do understand they why have they not do anything so far why do they not address those concern in advance meanwhile the agricultural tax change will afflict vastly more farming family than the treasury estimate family who work all hour whatever the season on very low margin can see the embarrassment write all over the face of government members many of whom represent rural area for the first and very likely now the last time thirdly we know that the government seem to have zero appetite to take on vested interest or reform our hugely pressured public service they have shovel out cash to their union friend who have be delighted to stick to their fax machine and similarly ancient working practice what have the government get in return for all those million no commitment to make any efficiency whatever nor do the government seem much interested in legislation they have not present many bills and the bills so far have often include not carefully draft law but simply vague and sweeping arrogation of new power this be what government do when they do not know what to do the government be even hide behind the very early presentation of private member bill on assist die one of the most sensitive and complex issue that we face the prime minister himself promise esther rantzen in march that he would make time to debate these issue but yesterday he refuse the request of my right hon friend the member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke to give the bill more time on report will the leader of the house now give that commitment the astonishing fact be that after year in opposition the labour party come into office with almost no real plan instead we have government who have already lose their way government with no real sense of urgency and no positive flavour or theme of any kind ask the leader of the house this we know what and who this government be against but what be this government for also wish his majesty the king very happy birthday this be islamophobia awareness month chance for we all to come together to tackle all form of religious and racial hatred it be also transgend awareness week which start yesterday celebrate our trans hero it be chance to remind ourselves that the trans community be one of the most abused suffer high level of mental health problem and be more likely to be homeless or ostracise congratulate the right hon member for croydon south chris philp on his big promotion to the shadow cabinet as say last week the leader of the opposition do indeed love tryer and the right hon gentleman many talent be at long last be recognise also warmly welcome the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman to his place in what think be his first ever contribution to business question in his quite long parliamentary career have to say that there have be slight upgrade in the joke in comparison with those of some of his predecessor understand that the right hon gentleman be biographer of edmund burke who be see as founder of modern conservatism and modern politic as such be very much look forward to work with he on the modernisation committee and the agenda of modernise this parliament can not promise he that all our dealing will be quite that highbrow because be afraid his responsibility bring other thing with they and he might find himself get bogge down with the state of the toilet or complaint about the wi fi but look forward to work with he may take this opportunity to thank the right hon gentleman for raise the terminally ill adult end of life bill many colleague have ask about the process and whether there will be sufficient time for further debate and scrutiny of this important bill so perhaps may take this opportunity to explain far some of the issue around it know that people care deeply about this issue and there be strongly hold view on both side as such it be matter for member to consider personally and freely know from the last debate on this issue hold in the house that it can be the good of moment for parliament with consider thoughtful and respectful debate it be not government bill similar issue such as legalise abortion and homosexuality have come about via private member bills in the past and believe that be the appropriate way to consider matter of conscience with free vote and neutral government position as the bill will be the first item of business on november it be highly likely that the debate on second reading will last for the full five hour that be comparable to proceeding on any other bill perhaps long and be sure the house would want that to be the case should the house agree to its second reading the bill would then be consider in committee probably for several week the whole house will also have further opportunity to debate and vote on those matter on report and again on third reading which will not be until april at the early the government have duty to ensure that any bill that pass through parliament be effective and can be enforce that be why if any bill be to be support by the house we would expect to work with the promote member to ensure that it be workable this be matter for the house to decide and the government will implement the will of the house whatever it so choose hope that will help member when consider these issue the right hon gentleman ask about number of budget measure but be afraid the cat really be let out of the bag this week because we finally learn that the conservative party support all the benefit that the budget bring but do not support any of the measure that will pay for they we be now see return to the magic money tree economic pursue by his predecessor liz truss we have have to make difficult choice to balance the book so that there be no return to austerity and so that we can invest in the economy and renew our public service for the long run be afraid that the shadow leader of the house be scaremongere with number of the issue that he raise he will know that more than half of employer will see no change at all or will pay no additional national insurance from this package he fail to mention the important change we be make to business rate which will support many high street business he might want to include that in his future calculation charity gps and other healthcare provider as have just be say at the dispatch box by my hon friend the minister for secondary care have be put in an incredibly precarious position after year of chronic under investment and mismanagement by the conservatives we will do what we can and further announcement will be make about the distribution of health funding put on record that the nhs have receive its single big increase in spending power for many year be that something that the shadow leader of the house support or reject be not clear what his party position on the budget be any more we have have to make tough choice because of the poison chalice and inheritance leave by his party that be once describe as struggle economy and anaemic growth those be not my word but his many people who have permanent and often worsen medical condition be reject when they apply for blue badge with their local authority the blue badge scheme help people who have medical issue physical or mental with access to car parking that be close to their destination be aware of constituent who have dementia and other medical condition whose application for blue badge have be reject by my local council as such may request that we have debate in government time on the blue badge scheme in england and how local authority implement the scheme for resident thank my hon friend for that important question which get raise many time in these session he be right that it be for local council to decide whether individual be eligible for badge but will certainly make sure that the department for transport have hear his question today think it would make very good topic for an adjournment debate call the liberal democrat spokesperson also welcome the new shadow leader of the house to his position look forward to work with he on the modernisation committee and join he in wish happy birthday to his majesty king charles join the leader of the house in welcome transgender awareness week the liberal democrats welcome the announcement

ewell helen maguire and for hazel grove lisa smart meet delegation of ukrainian mps this week and they learn at first hand how invaluable this billion would be as ukraine work to repel putin illegal invasion while that be positive step we must also keep an eye on how we support ukraine at home in the uk we be proud of our support to ukrainian national and in particular the homes for ukraine scheme however some of the relationship between ukrainians and their british host family have break down leave already struggle local council to pick up the piece to help our ally ukraine we must ensure that our council also have the support they need will the leader of the house seek assurance that this support will be provide to avoid overwhelming local council and to reinforce britain capacity as safe haven for ukrainians thank the hon member for that important question we be pleased that we will see second reading of the financial assistance to ukraine bill next week that important measure will continue our ongoing support to ukraine which be unshakeable and long term she be right to raise that continue support home for ukraine have be one of the good scheme that the country have embark on many family across the country have take part in it and find great value and purpose in provide home for ukrainians the government will continue to support council and other to ensure that that scheme can continue in the long term for however long it take to support ukrainians while the war be ongoing have receive number of email about the winter fuel allowance and access to pension credit so have join force with accredited organisation to help people access and sign up to pension credit do the leader of the house agree that it be vital that we get as many people as possible sign up to pension credit thank my hon friend for do that important work it be vital that we raise awareness of pension credit and all the support it can bring to those who be eligible not only through the winter fuel allowance but in several other area it can make many eligible pensioner thousand of pound year well off fully support her endeavour that be something that the government

the new labour transport secretary have put this under review can the government make statement to clarify whether they support this important cross border transport link this government be commit to upgrade our woeful rail infrastructure which have suffer year of neglect and under investment from the hon gentleman party be afraid that many of the plan like the one he describe be work of fiction

absolutely be not there in this case we be ensure that we can take forward all these rail plan with confidence wish to ask the leader of the house about local issue that come across recently meet

also be aware that erskine may be clear that when nominate public bill committees in the case of bill which divide the house on cross party line it be vital that the committee of selection should have regard to the composition of the house in those term will she either now or subsequently if she need to refer to erskine may make absolutely sure that as the bill go through the house that balance will be retain so that we get the good possible legislation nothing be more important that legislate to make lawful the entitlement to take life thank the right hon gentleman for that question take some time in my opening remark to explain these matter and recognise and understand people concern as say second reading debate last five hour would be long than that of many substantial bills the second reading debate on the online safety bill which be huge and long anticipate for five year be reduce to just over two hour because of early statement and so on five hour be good amount of time for second reading notwithstanding the point that he raise on committee selection the right hon gentleman be right that should the bill pass second reading it will be for the sponsor member to put forward name for that committee he be right that the guidance on nominate those member state that that must reflect the party balance in the house and it should also reflect the balance of view on the bill as say the bill would then return to the full house for remain stage include report and third reading which would all have time for debate and vote the leader of the house will be aware of the news yesterday that post office could close that would have massive impact on our high street which be already struggle the kennington park branch in my constituency be one of those face possible closure in addition to the brixton and vauxhall bridge branch which border my constituency our post office be cornerstone for many of our resident number of whom can not use online service the

equality impact assessment and that the post office consider its decision my hon friend be absolutely right the government inherit post office that be simply not fit for purpose follow lot of disinterest from the previous government the post office do need serious culture change assure she that as understand it no decision have be take on the future of crown post office but know from my own constituency where recently the spring gardens crown post office in manchester be close what big issue this be for local community encourage every constituency mp like she to raise these matter here and directly with ministers the previous government identify the road as of crucial importance to the uk as whole so despite the fact that transport be devolved matter money be earmark for improvement have be try without success to find out what be happen to that money be astonish to find that labour msp be able to tweet detail about the road he apparently know more about it than anyone in this house may we have statement from the government explain what be happen with the and the money that be clearly earmark for it as the hon gentleman say these issue be devolve and we allocate the money as part of other consequential to the scottish government to consider those matter but will ensure that the issue he raise be notice by the minister will ask for full reply about that road to be

period of disruption thank my hon friend for raise that important question he will be aware that resource allocate to firearm licensing unit be matter for the relevant chief officer however we would expect force to process these application very quickly and efficiently so that resource can get to where they be need the next home office question be the week after next so he might want to raise the matter with the home secretary then hundred of farmer in my rural constituency be face mental health crisis they be not sure whether their farm and their life work will be pass on to the next

leader of the house today commit to debate in government time on the propose change to the agricultural property relief and inheritance tax rule to give our farmer the reassurance they so desperately need thank the hon gentleman for that question which give an opportunity to far clarify some of the point that he and other have raise the government figure be base on actual claim not other people analysis they show that three quarter of farmer would be unaffected by the change and that only around claim from the wealthy estate would be affect each year there be number of mitigation available in relation to how long that could be pay back and so on the government support our rural community we support our farmer we be really proud to have return record number of labour mps represent rural

this subject today would add that mr speaker have repeatedly make it clear that ministers must make important policy statement to this house first in accordance with the government own ministerial code no doubt those message have now be hear lords spiritual women act extension bill lords second reading beg to move that the bill be now read second time be pleased to open the debate on this important but straightforward piece of legislation should start by welcome the shadow paymaster general to his role have no doubt that we will have some great robust debate over the dispatch boxes will just say to he now that he be in the shadow role that very much hope we can continue the cross party work that his predecessor and be pursue on infected blood compensation that cross party working have be extremely important member will of course be aware we debate this on tuesday that this government be pursue reform of the house of lords should be clear with the house that this bill be distinct from those reform it do not seek to make fundamental change its simple effect be to extend by five year the arrangement for the appointment of lords spiritual contain in the lords spiritual women act and like the act this bill have be introduce at the request of the church of england think it may be helpful to give the house little background as to how we arrive here there be bishop who sit in the house of lords and before the process for how and when they sit in the other place be determine solely by the bishoprics act five seat be automatically allocate to the archbishop of canterbury and the archbishop of york follow by the bishops of london durham and winchester the remainder be fill on the basis of seniority in other word length of tenure in the general synod of the church of england pass legislation to allow woman to become bishop for the first time however because of the rule of seniority we would have have to wait many year before those first female bishop could have be eligible to receive their writ of summon and become lords spiritual that would have create situation whereby woman be prominently involve in church leadership but be unrepresented in the house of lords to address that at the church request both houses pass legislation in to fast track female bishop into the house of lords the effect of that legislation be that if there be female diocesan bishop available when lords spiritual seat become vacant she will be appoint to the seat ahead of male bishop irrespective of seniority since enact the act have have clear effect we have see six female bishop sit in the other place early than they otherwise would have do the bishop of gloucester be appoint to the house as the first female bishop on september since that first appointment the lords spiritual have welcome six more woman to sit on their benches the value of the legislation be about to be see in action again follow the recent retirement of the bishop of worcester debbie sellin the bishop of peterborough will soon replace he in the lords under the provision of the act and then the recently appoint bishop of coventry sophie jelley will be first in line for appointment to the house of lords upon any future retirement madam deputy speaker as you can see there have be progress but there remain only handful of female bishop on the lords spiritual benches today the issue be that that act will expire in may what the five year extension contain in this bill do be to allow more time for the positive effect of that piece of legislation to operate the bill mean that if any of the lords spiritual seat that be not automatically allocate become vacant between now and they will continue to be fill by the most senior eligible female bishop if there be any available at that point be enjoy immensely my right hon friend very detailed explanation of how we get here may ask he what conversation he have have with the church about the step that it can take to increase the diversity of potential bishop and to ensure that ultimately there be wide pool of people to appoint to the house of lords be very grateful to my hon friend for his intervention as he would imagine certainly have have discussion with the church of england and not just prior to the introduction of this bill but prior to the wide reform of the lords in which the government be engage those conversation be hugely important as be diversity this legislation will extend the diversity have woman bishop in the house of lords that we have see since the act reach the statute book the government view be that five year be an appropriate length of time to extend these provision to consolidate the positive effect that there have be so far hope that this very narrowly focused and simple bill which will extend an act that have achieve such positive change over the past nine year will gain support from all part of the house call the shadow minister thank the paymaster general for his clear introduction of this legislation and for the praise that he give to my predecessor my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen very much want to continue the work that my right hon friend do on the infected blood scandal with the paymaster general and look forward to do so may also thank the right hon member for extend warm welcome to be special adviser in the house of lords in the month after the act be pass and see at first hand the introduction of the first female bishop as paymaster general the right hon member have an important role he will remember that viscount addison do it back in the and become the first labour knight of the garter which be sure the right hon member may be look forward to in the future this be straightforward bill limit in its scope with the simple purpose of extend the lords spiritual women act by another five year introduce by the coalition government the act complement the legislation that have be bring in the previous year to allow woman to become bishop in the first place the intention be to ensure that those woman have fair chance of sit alongside their male counterpart as one of the lords spiritual overall the act seem to have be successful in do so the original legislation suspend the rule that automatically elevate the most senior diocesan bishop to the house of lords and instead elevate female diocesan bishop if one be available this have mean that there be now six woman bishop in the house of lords all of whom have make valuable contribution in the other place the extension of the bill be even short it simply extend the sunset clause that be agree in and maintain the suspension in rule so that female bishop will join the lords spiritual slightly soon than they would otherwise have do let express the opposition support for this simple piece of legislation when we first introduce this legislation it be agree that year span would give sufficient time to assess its effectiveness and because we be here today believe that we can probably agree that that timeframe be fine would like to ask the paymaster general when he expect this legislation to no long be necessary predict that he might say as that be the date set for the sunset of this legislation can he confirm why it be this timeframe that have be select as previously mention there be six woman bishop in the house of lords and be glad that the legislation have support they in contribute so meaningfully to parliament but can he tell the house whether he expect to see another five year extension in few year time let start by say how pleased be to be speak in support of the bill on second reading congratulate my right hon friend the minister on his opening remark in the church of england make it possible for woman to become bishop the usual process of appoint bishop to the other place mean that it would have take many year for woman bishop to enter the lords that be why the act be bring in to speed up the representation of woman among the lords spiritual as we debate today short and narrow bill want to pay tribute to some of the woman bishop who have make history the church of england first woman bishop libby lane take her place as the bishop of stockport in hear hear indeed now the bishop of derby libby lane be know for her dignified and thoughtful leadership and her advocacy for child and young people the first female lord spiritual be rachel treweek who enter the lords in during her tenure she campaign tirelessly for prison reform especially on how prison affect woman and family she have call for more race class gender and age diversity in the church and have push for humane response to refugee she have also look at way in which we can improve child sense of self worth value and confidence also pay tribute to the lord bishop of london sarah mullally former chief nursing officer who be deeply engage with the community she serve she have promote the living wage and speak up for our beloved national health service and for the most vulnerable in society include the elderly and those face persecution the act speed up the entry of six woman bishop to the other place we now have lords spiritual seven of whom be woman hope that be make the value of those woman bishop contribution in the lords clear they enrich debate and provide much need representation the lord bishop of chelmsford guli francis dehqani come to britain as refugee after her family flee persecution during the iranian revolution in the other place she have carefully and intelligently work hard to scrutinise policy on issue include housing immigration and criminal justice like so many of her colleague she truly listen to the view of other speak with grassroots knowledge most importantly about the region under her care the progress that we have see in make the lords spiritual more diverse should be celebrate but we know and the church know that another push be need to make the lords spiritual representative and to bring they more up to date that be particularly the case for woman bishop from black asian and ethnic minority background who make such an important contribution and be currently underrepresented in the other place and more broadly in the church on that point acknowledge the history make nature of my hon friend appointment as the second church estates commissioner which hope demonstrate our commitment to diversity and representation thank my hon friend it be truly an honour and privilege to serve in that position want to acknowledge the trailblaze bishop of dover rose hudson wilkin the first black woman to become church of england bishop she be the chaplain to her late majesty queen elizabeth ii and for nine year she be the chaplain to the speaker of the house of commons john bercow the first woman to carry out that role her presence as leader in the church be call to young woman from diverse background not to shy away from the work that they want to do but the bishop of dover be not yet one of many there be more work to do that be why the bill will help it be narrow bill extend the exist provision for five year which should get we close to the lords spiritual well represent the make up of our country that be why support the bill and hope that member across the house will do the same call the liberal democrat spokesperson the liberal democrats support the extension of this legislation and its ambition to make our second chamber more equal and representative if pass the bill will extend the timeframe for the process of accelerate woman bishop to the other chamber mean that when vacancy arise among the bishop appoint by seniority it will be fill by the most senior eligible female bishop with the goal of reach gender parity as soon as possible we be glad of the intention behind the bill to address the current stark gender imbalance among our lords spiritual we support that aim and welcome step to ensure that parliament well reflect the country it serve fundamentally however we want to see complete reform of the house of lords strengthen the authority of our second chamber with democratic mandate parliament should be body that represent and reflect the diversity and richness of the people and culture that make up this country and we must do all we can to make that happen across both houses the bill aim to ensure significant female representation among the lords spiritual by extend the arrangement of the lords spiritual women act by an additional five year so that its power continue until without it the position would return to the status quo ante whereby bishop become member of the house of lords accord to their time in office give that the legislation allow woman to become bishop be enact relatively recently in it be vital that the provision of the act be extend in order to continue to address the historical inequality and accelerate the move towards gender parity in our upper chamber the extension of the act be positive step to ensure that bishop in the lords be more representative of the country as whole as well as their congregation and the bill in support move towards gender parity be significant step in move towards more representative parliament although we support the legislation and welcome all move towards create more balanced parliament we must question why the late legislation have be unsuccessful in reach the goal of gender parity for bishop in the upper chamber over the past decade what further measure need to be take to increase accessible route to create more equal parliament ask the minister why the legislation continue to be restrict with time limit and what conversation he have have with the church of england regard that do he believe that five additional year be sufficient time to reach equal representation give the progress achieve by the original piece of legislation the act allow just six woman bishop to take up seat in the house of lords although pay tribute to the hon member for battersea marsha de cordova for her excellent speech which really highlight the success of the woman who have be able to take up those role we must question why the late legislation be unsuccessful and what other step we should take in order to reach the goal of gender parity acknowledge the temperate and sensible approach that the hon lady take to these matter do she share my query about where all those who have show an interest this week in the presence of bishop in the house of lords happen to be this afternoon thank the hon gentleman for his point there be great flurry of interest when be stand here on tuesday make many of these point about the make up of the house of lords agree with he that it be extremely strange that the people who spend such long

ensure that it be well represent as my hon friend the member for battersea and other have say diversity be important across the community if we do not ensure that the house of lords bishop look like we how will we ensure that we can advocate effectively for constituent rise order as many colleague be interested in this debate may encourage intervention to be relevant to the debate that be take place give way to my right hon friend the member for walsall and bloxwich valerie vaz thank the minister who be do fantastic job of ensure through the bill that woman be represent at every level in the century we should not be talk about first for woman in the spirit of colleague who have intervene already may ask my hon friend to recognise the brilliant role play by the first black woman to be

you madam deputy speaker for grant this important and timely debate as the mp for very vocal airport community welcome the minister to his role and reassure he that he will be hear from great deal over the come parliament this topic be close to my constituent heart every morning at am they hear jet engine above their head every year heathrow airport executive threaten to bring back the third runway and every decade new proposal to change the flight path be put forward my constituent be not alone in the uk more than of the british population live between two and mile from an airport although they accept that aircraft noise be fact of life they should not be ask to tolerate constant attempt to increase the number of flight above their home in the opening month of this new parliament labour have chance to step away from the damaging policy of the past and build new relationship with airport community relationship in which the need of local people and our environment be genuinely balanced against the demand of the aviation industry to begin rebalance the relationship urge the department for transport to consider three request first to acknowledge the health impact of night flight on airport community and work to ban they above heavily populate area secondly to accept that the expansion of heathrow airport would fly in the face of britain climate target and have an unacceptable impact on my constituent in richmond park and elsewhere across london and the south east and thirdly to recognise that any proposal to change flight path above london and the south east should be accompany by proposal for do minimum approach ensure that people do not have to accept change merely for the sake of change turn first to night flight which be the most intrusive form of aircraft noise there be clear evidence that they harm the physical health of resident who live under flight path long term exposure to nocturnal aircraft noise be strongly link to sleep disorder and broad health impact thank my hon friend for give way on that point and for secure this incredibly important debate like her constituent the resident of twickenham teddington whitton and the hamptons be very concerned about the impact of aircraft noise above they do she agree that give that the civil aviation authority itself have acknowledge evidence that long term aircraft noise have harmful effect on child memory sustain attention read comprehension and read ability for the sake of their health we need strict restriction on night flight across our constituency and all of west london frankly at the moment these massive jet engine be flout the rule overnight on regular basis my hon friend be right she speak passionately on behalf of her constituent in twickenham who know be blight by these issue just as much as my constituent in richmond park she be right about the health impact of long term exposure to nocturnal aircraft noise which be strongly link to sleep disorder and broad health impact for each additional db of night time aircraft noise that community be expose to there be an increase of between and in resident risk of high blood pressure increase the risk of stroke and heart attack other researcher have find link between long term exposure to aircraft noise and an increase risk of obesity depression and cardiovascular issue the human cost of these flight be substantial but when have raise this issue in the house ministers have fall back on study by york aviation that argue that night flight add billion to our economy that study have be repeatedly challenge on both its outcome and methodology and urge the minister to instruct his official to examine the wide body of evidence researcher at the transport research service and consultancy ce delft find that ban on night flight would harm the national economy only if the passenger who currently arrive on schedule flight before am be not transfer to other flight in addition the heathrow association for the control of aircraft noise have point out that estimate of the value of night flight often massage definition of night time job which inflate key figure in the light of that urge the government to commit to commission full independent analysis on the impact of night flight on our economy resident physical health and local people mental wellbeing to inform potential ban on night flight at heathrow while night flight be constant concern to my resident the spectre of the third runway continue to hang over south west london hansard show that the third runway have be mention no few than time in this house and have be the topic of three debate two early day motion and countless open letter despite the effort of dozen of mps the last government resolutely refuse to abandon the project they say that we should ignore the million tonne of carbon dioxide that it would generate every year the billion it would cost to clean up the damage that the runway would do to our environment and the impact it would have on air quality in our community do my hon friend agree that there be no way that this government can meet their net zero and climate commitment if they give the green light to third runway at heathrow as have be widely report indeed the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have be on record in the past as have be very against third runway at heathrow he should be fight the corner of the environment and our planet and the health and wellbeing of our constituent by stand up to the department for transport give any green light to third runway at heathrow again my hon friend be absolutely right in the past week the prime minister give new impetus to the achievement of our net zero target and it be essential that we have another look at the damage that third runway would cause at heathrow we must seriously re examine the case for proceed and as my hon friend say also look at the impact it would have on our community meta analysis of study publish between and have show that researcher consistently find elevated level of ultra fine particulate matter in airport community constant exposure to those particulate can lead to decrease lung function oxidative dna damage and premature death allow the third runway and the flight that it will add to london sky be not only an annoyance to resident it be risk to their health the third runway would have far far reach consequence other than simply taint the air that my constituent breathe at this week the prime minister vow to cut uk emission by before but his own chancellor have refuse to take the third runway off the table know from read the reference to the third runway in hansard that ministers from both main party be happy to avoid answer question from opposition mp for that reason urge the minister to consider the word of his colleague the secretary of state for energy security and net zero who say raise the issue of the heathrow third runway gingerly but if we be so serious about this climate emergency do not see how we can not look at all the thing that the government and the private sector be do and ask whether they make sense in net zero world official report june vol in the last division on the third runway seven member of the current cabinet include the prime minister oppose expansion urge the minister to work across department to ensure that government policy reflect their commitment to our local community and our planet before any decision on the third runway be make finally night flight and the third runway have be constant source of concern to my resident over the past decade but they must now contend with the government new proposal for airspace modernisation although understand that the proposal be intend to improve efficiency at the airport and bring aviation in london into the century ask for caution last year the london assembly pass motion call on the airport to recognise the damage that its proposal would have on richmond park wildlife and ecology the motion highlight that redirect plane over london large nature reserve fly in the face of decade of conservation effort indeed the noise from long haul flight and the additional pollution from fuel dumping could change that fragile ecosystem for year to come at the same time airspace modernisation would lay the groundwork for an increase in the number of aircraft movement at heathrow and expose new community across south west london to aircraft noise directly above their home for the first time the propose uk airspace design service will of course help to guide the development of those new flight path but it be essential that the public be give genuine chance to choose between the proposal when the propose flight path system be put to public consultation next year urge the minister to ensure that resident can choose do minimum option new guidance system can be integrate and small amendment to current system make but ultimately there should be an option to maintain the path in roughly similar location we should not ask community simply to accept change for the sake of change they deserve real choice over the future of their sky rather than forced decision between bad option london be one of the most overflown capital city in the western world hundred of thousand of londoners across the city experience the negative impact of aircraft noise yet the government tiptoe around real measure that would improve resident life by ban night flight abandon the third runway and give our constituent genuine choice over the positioning of flight path ministers would demonstrate to london airport community that we be be hear the previous government policy on the aviation sector be mark by an inability to stand up for the right of community in the face of heathrow and other airport the minister now have chance to be well than his predecessor to put people before profit and to consider what be really good for the capital and airport community across the uk congratulate the hon member for richmond park sarah olney on secure this debate about the impact of aircraft noise on local community and thank she for her speech aviation noise present sensitive issue grow up under the flight path to manchester airport and remember the bac one eleven the trident and concorde as school child see the space shuttle do low pass on jumbo jet which inspire for the rest of my life thank god we do not have those plane any more give the smell that they emit however we need to strike fair balance between the impact of aviation on the local environment and community and the economic benefit that flight bring that be the challenge for aviation noise policy the hon lady speak passionately about the impact of aviation on noise level and recognise that noise from aircraft particularly at night impact on the local community and as she say can impact on people physical and mental wellbeing major airport with more than movement per year be oblige under the environmental noise england regulations to produce noise action plan noise action plan act as driver for aircraft noise management and for the mitigation that be require around airport be pleased to report that all major airport within scope of the regulation have now produce their noise action plan for to with the exception of the noise action plan for manchester airport in my constituency which be submit later can confirm that those noise action plan have now be adopt by the department for environment food and rural affairs the heathrow airport noise action plan have be publish follow consultation with local stakeholder as the hon lady rightly say it be supplement by commitment to commission and support research and focus on improve the way that the airport communicate and engage with local community heathrow see that last element as pivotal in help it to understand and address key priority for local people heathrow also have sustainability plan that cover wide range of issue relate to noise management the airport have set clear objective to reduce by the number of people who be sleep disturb and highly annoyed compare with its baseline of the airport have be work to develop test and finalise new package of noise insulation vortex protection and home relocation support know as the quieter neighbourhood support scheme heathrow residential insulation scheme cover of insulation cost up to for home most affect by noise be grateful to the minister for highlight the various package that be available for people affect by noise as he will appreciate number of my constituent be in that position yet many be find that some of those package be insufficient and difficult to access will he meet to discuss some of those individual case be happy to meet all individual member who want to improve the quality of people live around our port and airport heathrow use differential charging structure for aircraft operate at the airport the structure encourage the use of good in class aircraft impose high charge for noisy aircraft and low charge for quieter one heathrow encourage the use of quieter plane by adjust the differential in night and post midnight charge for unscheduled operation with the aim of reduce those operation after pm the government too be commit to research into aviation noise and two study be under way one study that have be commission be on the effect of aviation noise on sleep disturbance and annoyance and how they vary at different time at night the study be collaboration between st george university london the national centre for social research noise consultants ltd and the university of pennsylvania and be the first study of aviation noise effect on sleep disturbance in the uk for year the first stage of the aviation night noise involve cross sectional survey of people who live near eight uk airport to assess the association between aircraft noise exposure at night and subjective assessment of sleep quality and annoyance that stage of the study be currently go through peer review and we expect to publish it next year the second stage involve an observational study of individual recruit from the survey to assess the association between aircraft noise exposure and objective sleep quality that involve assessment of sleep disturbance and sound level measurement in participant bedroom that stage of the study be currently in the field take together these piece of evidence will be use to inform future policy for manage night time aviation noise exposure and to assist with the management and mitigation of health impact on local community they will also support any wide assessment of the cost and benefit of night fly our priority remain to deliver high quality robust evidence base and we be take all the necessary step to deliver that we be now work on the basis that we will publish the full evidence base from the annie study in autumn be grateful to the minister for give way again be pleased to hear that there will be proper study of the impact of aviation noise on sleep disruption and very much look forward to that publication he may have miss the early part of my speech where ask for much more robust study of the economic benefit of night flight will he comment far on that will come to that and look forward to meet the hon member because would like to have safe cycle ride around richmond park one of these day will be raise that with the constituency mp and think it could help with climate mitigation and climate change look forward to her view on that as have acknowledge noise from aircraft particularly at night impact on local community at the same time night flight be also vital part of global aviation and provide significant economic benefit not just to the capital city but as we know to the whole of the uk the whole uk rely on heathrow as our only hub airport to keep the flow of people good and service move support thousand of job as result with that in mind for several decade the government have set out noise control include restriction on night operation at heathrow gatwick and stansted the house can imagine my surprise on become the new minister to realise that have direct power over the south east three and no power over the rest of the nation that will hopefully change in the year to come those airport be designate for noise purpose under the civil aviation act that control reflect the need to balance the impact on community with the benefit to the uk economy we also know that heathrow be one of our major hub airport for cargo and freight to keep this country fuel supply and feed at other airport the noise control be set by local ordinance and local competent planning authority the current night flight regime limit the number of flight for the purpose of noise management the night flight restriction significantly reduce the number of flight that could otherwise operate within the night quota period between pm and am early this year the department for transport consult on proposal for the next night flight regime at heathrow gatwick and stansted airport which will commence in october year or so from now the consultation propose that movement and quota limit for heathrow gatwick and stansted would remain the same as now for three year period cover october to october that be while we await evidence that could support change in the future thank the hon member for richmond park for her response to the consultation and hope soon to be in position to announce decision on the next night flight regime at heathrow the number of movement permit in the night quota period have not change for many year during that time aircraft have become quieter as say at the start of the speech and the overall noise footprint of the airport have shrink progress have be make at heathrow for example between and there be reduction of in the number of household expose to aircraft noise within the london db noise contour area the noise footprint of new generation aircraft such as the airbus and the boeing max be typically small on departure and small on arrival than the aircraft they be replace talk with manufacturer all the time about the future of flight and how we can carry on reduce the noise footprint of these vehicle overall noise from aircraft movement be expect to continue to fall in the future compare with today level will briefly touch on airspace modernisation which be key plank of our manifesto it be one of our key commitment along with sustainable aviation fuel we have an analogue system in our sky in the uk in digital age the system be design close to the time that yuri gagarin go into space than today pilot who travel through time come in the tardis back to the future would still be fly the same flight path that they would recognise from more than or year ago that have to change if we be to maximise the benefit to aviation and growth and the carbon reduction we could bring if we just get the flight not to circle over the hon member constituency but to fly in straight line point to point hear the minister from sedentary position call my hon friend the member for richmond park sarah olney luddite when she make her point about airspace modernisation luddite yes be afraid so the minister be make the point that we need modernisation say to he respectfully that my hon friend and our constituent recognise the need for innovation and to move with technology as it change of course we want to reduce carbon emission and we support well heathrow not big heathrow as we understand its importance to the economy but on airspace modernisation we could still achieve some of the benefit by adopt do minimum approach gain benefit from modernisation while not come up with lot of new flight path and really intensify noise over certain area that might not be overflown at the moment we have see how in other country airspace modernisation have lead to noise sewer will he offer reassurance to the resident of teddington twickenham the hamptons and st margarets that those place will not end up become noise sewer will he please commit to do minimum approach and transparency on the process not for moment do suggest that the hon member would throw their sabot as in sabotage into the mill to grind it up do expect co operation on this think that we can make life well for all people and rise tide float all boat the process will be open and transparent have already announce the setting up of the uk airspace design service which will go out for consultation expect member to be fully involve in shape its work over the next few year as we look to decarbonise our sky and improve they in the way just mention there be so much to be gain we can move on scottish airspace and northern england airspace we be already move on south west airspace the south east will be the hard bit to crack and that be why the service will focus on that hope that we can work together to get that do hopefully in this parliament if not hopefully early in the next one the government recognise the impact that aviation noise can have on local community at the same time we live in fully interconnect global world and the aviation sector have material value for the uk economy the government continue to strive for the correct balance between the impact of aviation on the local community and the economic benefit that flight bring question put and agree to house adjourn
