lightweight multi role missile those will be in ukrainian hand at the turn of the year we expect to step up that production and delivery during the course of next year do the secretary of state share my concern at the recent medium interview give by lead candidate to be labour next ambassador to washington dc this supposedly clever negotiator declare that ukraine should not expect to get its territory back and should not expect to be put on the path to join nato but could perhaps secure some security guarantee from western country do the secretary of state agree that whoever be send to washington should be somebody who support ukraine in defend itself and do not reward russian aggression with pre emptive capitulation one of the first privilege have in this new role be to represent the country at the nato washington summit that be the point at which the nato nation collectively agree to step up support for ukraine and to develop the security guarantee that ukraine will need in the long term the task for we and ally that support ukraine be to help ukrainians and support they in their fight now at the point at which they judge the talking should start our role then be to give they equally steadfast support and we will be sure the whole house stand solidly with ukraine on its one thousandth day counter russian aggression and do so for we all but its ability to do so be weaken by north korea send armament and manpower the iranians send drone and oil contract still be sign will the minister assure we that in the light of the american decision to allow strike inside russia we will also give permission for our missile to be use to break up concentration of arm and material inside russia will not be draw on detail about long range missile today it risk operational

widely report yesterday president biden lift restriction on the use of long range us missile give the continuous bombing of ukrainian community by russia and give that thousand of north korean troop be fight against our ally in our continent will ukraine now be allow to use those storm shadow missile obviously within the confine of international law or do we expect ukraine to continue fight and defend itself with one hand tie behind its back while keep those storm shadows in safe storage say again that will not compromise operational security and comment on the detail of long range system today the prime minister have be clear as be be to the house that we must double down on the support to ukraine give it the support it need and do so for as long as it take in do so we will continue

would be delighted to work with the hon lady to move that forward child social care with permission mr speaker would like to make statement about the government plan for child social care know all member here today will agree that care for vulnerable child be among the most vital responsibility of any government this government treat no issue with more importance than the urgent challenge of improve child social care this be new era of child centre government of put child first that be how we achieve our opportunity mission how we break the unfair link between background and success and how we support family to achieve and thrive our mission apply to all child especially the most vulnerable those for whom childhood be storm of instability neglect and even violence deny the foundation of love that be the first right of any child child social care alone can not right all those wrong we need join up approach across government and beyond that be why mission lead government be so important but do well child social care empower family to support their child put they back on the path to happy healthy life it be with great concern that come here today to tell members what they must already know the system that the government have inherit from opposition members be break and fail far too many child it be keep alive by the effort of our amazing workforce want to thank all those work so hard to keep child safe but child social care be struggle under an impossible weight we have more child in care in this country than ever before with more and more money follow child into the most expensive part of the system resource be suck out of preventive service push yet more young people into care and so the vicious cycle continue high cost but poor outcome my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister rightly identify that cycle in his review over two year ago broken market for care vulnerable to the shameful profiteering of too many private company local government spending on child social care have rise by billion over the last decade what do we have to show for it system too busy treat symptom to tackle cause system that cost more for taxpayer but deliver less for family and system that be fail our child and which be cry out for change today the labour government begin that change ambitious wide range reform to lift the life chance of our most vulnerable child be pleased to announce the publication of policy statement that put child social care back in the service of child and family break the cycle of crisis intervention this be the big reform of child social care in generation it start with the acknowledgement that wherever possible child should remain with their family that be where child belong it be on that foundation of family love that child can live happy life that be why early intervention tackle problem before they escalate hold the key to bright future for our child we will simplify the way we fund local government next year consolidate more than million of child social care funding within the local government finance settlement with immediate effect we will suspend the payment by result aspect of the support family funding we will renew the way we work with the sector co design service together to meet the need of child and family in their community the deputy prime minister and be ambitious about reform how we work with child and family from when they encounter challenge right through to building solution we will set out funding plan for child social care and future investment in preventive service in the upcoming local government finance settlement all family face challenge at one time or another want to help they to come up with their own solution wherever possible so we will legislate to embed family group decision making as an offer all family can access early targeted support minimise more costly and disruptive intervention later so it be much well value for taxpayer but ultimately that be not the point the most important point be that it be well for child live now and in the future build that bedrock of family love and support that we all need we know that we must also have strong child protection measure in place so today be set out plan to require every council to have multi agency child safeguarding team consult school and teacher to stop child fall through the crack sometimes despite the good effort of all involve child can not remain at home and our priority then be to support they to live with kinship carer or in foster family connect to extend family in stable home that be why be not just pleased but deeply proud when the government announce the large ever national investment in kinship care at last month budget an investment in the future of vulnerable child that money will trial new kinship allowance to help family member and friend to care for vulnerable child we will also extend the virtual school head programme place it on statutory footing and champion the education of child in kinship care even with these change however there will remain instance in which child must enter the care system so it be vital that we fix the break care market we know that the quality and safety of child home in england be simply not good enough year after year the previous government sit on their hand while child be let down their life chance wreck their hope dash and their dignity ignore know that many opposition members share the disappointment feel as ministers in that government ignore these issue and leave they to drift when they could have grip they as this government do today we will act decisively help child to remain close to the people who love they whenever possible and end the reckless profiteering of some provider we will rebalance and stabilise the placement market include by establish financial oversight scheme for the very first time we will make the market more transparent and we will empower local authority to collaborate on placement include through regional care co operative we will give ofsted the power to move more quickly against unregistered care provider and tackle pattern of poor care those be action to fix the care market but member should be in no doubt that if company continue to make extreme profit at the cost of vulnerable child will go far and hard we will introduce new power allow the government to directly cap the level of profit from child social care placement at their good private provider can help improve the life of vulnerable child but when the focus drift towards exploitation in the pursuit of profit be in no doubt that will act these be the reform to deliver the good placement for child but the journey do not end there we must give young people leave care the right support as they make the transition to adult life be pleased to co chair the ministerial care leaver board alongside the deputy prime minister early this month we will drive forward action across government and we will expand the stay close programme into national entitlement of enhance practical and emotional support for care leaver it be time to fix the foundation of child social care invest in the groundwork for strong sector and that include datum we will deliver on our manifesto commitment to improve the sharing of information for the benefit of all child include those in care we will change the law in two way first we will introduce provision for single unique child identifier to join up datum from different service which be further step towards ensure that service work hard for child parent and professional secondly we will establish new duty provide clear legal basis for those work with child to share information for the purpose of safeguarding we be determined to ensure that child social care be an excellent area in which to work we have publish online resource to improve the health and wellbeing of staff and we be join the national workload action group to cut unnecessary task free up staff to concentrate on child and their family while agency worker can help to manage fluctuation in demand they be no substitute for permanent workforce child and family deserve stable professional relationship we will therefore limit the use of agency social worker by local authority act to reverse the alarming increase in their prevalence every child deserve the good possible start in life to grow up in family fill with love but not every child have that there be still far too many who lack the stability safety and love that they need to go on to happy and healthy life our opportunity mission be for they we be break down barrier for they and the announcement that have bring to the house today be for they but we can not achieve this alone keep child safe be everyone business not merely mine or the government but that of each of we in this house and all of we across the country we need partnership with family the workforce carer provider health police school college and yes with member right across the house today be the start of much need change change that will fix child social care change that will keep family together where possible and child safe where necessary change that will give each and every child the good start in life the child of our great country deserve nothing less commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement welcome the government focus today on child social care and on the profiteer issue that we identify and set up the market intervention advisory group to look at when we be in government however at the heart of the problem be lack of high quality place for look after child that be what be cause the high cost of placement as demand be outstrip supply in its report the competition and markets authority do not recommend profit cap because the central problem face the market be lack of capacity the cma conclude that take measure to limit the profitability of provider would risk increase the capacity shortfall while share the secretary of state desire to ensure that we be get good value for the taxpayer in this sector we need to solve the capacity issue first otherwise ironically she risk drive up price and exacerbate the shortage of place the last government take step at the budget in april to address the capacity side with million allocate for build and maintain placement for look after child note that in the most recent budget despite the welcome money for kinship care there be no more money for increase the number of place for look after child that be essential otherwise the strategy on place set out today simply will not work what plan have the secretary of state make to increase the number of place for look after child how much she will need to fund that do she ask the treasury for the money at the most recent budget what be her assessment of the impact of the change announce today on the number of place available for look after child the review carry out by the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister commission by the conservatives in government find that profit cap would not work as it would be relatively easy for provider to reallocate income and expenditure to maintain profit level do the secretary of state agree be the level of profit that she refer to this morning the maximum level of profit that she be aim for if not what will it be the capacity problem rest both on the availability of place and on the demand for those place the secretary of state have indicate that she would like to take step on early intervention which be obviously vital those be not specify in her statement but hope that she will bring they to the house at the early opportunity as they be critical to solve the issue she say that she want to scrap payment by result give that that be an early intervention programme on the basis of what evidence be she do so do she have an evaluation of what scrap payment by result will do we welcome much else in the statement include the regional care co operative multi agency team and the enhanced role of ofsted in the sector on the latter be the secretary of state make any change to the failure regime for child home and the regularity of inspection the children commissioner have do outstanding work on the increase use of deprivation of liberty order will the secretary of state outline what action she be take on that important issue be pleased to see the labour government take forward our proposal for unique child identifier when can we expect the bill create that to be introduce want the government to succeed in this area child social care be hidden issue and get it right be at the heart of solve so many problem that this country face hope the secretary of state can reassure and the house that she will do more to bring forward great supply of place for look after child and that an early intervention system be forthcoming because the future of look after child rely on it can say to the right hon lady that we will absolutely do more we be do more in four month than the conservatives do in year they have year yet she have the temerity to stand there and carp about the change that we be bring in for some of the most vulnerable child in our country market be leave to fail cost be leave to soar and bad of all child be fail we will ensure that there be high quality placement for our child who need that provision that be why we set out million to expand capacity and provision for child who need it we have to break this cycle of crisis intervention that be lead to spiral cost and poor outcome and bankrupt local council that be why we will have much more of focus on kinship care foster care and early intervention to support family know that where family be support at the early possible moment we can often prevent problem from escalate and the right hon lady will know that too be determined that we build system that give all our child the good possible start in life and that be why can confirm that we will give ofsted the power that it need to tackle unregistered and illegal provision and to ensure that it be look at pattern across provider we will introduce legislation on everything we have set out today as soon as parliamentary time allow but can say to she that this be urgent and we will act as swiftly as we can on the right hon lady question about the children commissioner welcome the work of the commissioner in this important area as on many other issue she have cast light on an important area of policy where we have not act swiftly and her party fail to act would gently point out to she that the children commissioner carry out that work on behalf of the department for education the conservatives have year to tackle these issue note that the right hon lady welcome some of the measure that we have set out today but when we set out legislation before this house to tackle the shameful failure that we have inherit hope that conservative members will back we and more importantly back the vulnerable child in our country call the chair of the education committee welcome the action that the government have announce today to improve child social care the secretary of state will know that family from the poor neighbourhood be time more likely to be refer to child social care than those from the rich area and that there be grow body of evidence link child poverty to the rise in child enter the care system how will she ensure that the upcoming child poverty strategy deliver more stability and safety for child and ensure that few family enter the kind of crisis that result in their child be remove from their care my hon friend have long champion this cause and bring considerable expertise to the role that she now undertake as chair of the select committee look forward to discuss these issue with she and her committee in due course she be right to identify that child poverty be significant issue in this area that be why we get the work of the child poverty taskforce under way in august we know that that work be crucial what she have set out today be something that have hear from parent the length and breadth of the country as part of the work that we be undertake it be important that alongside tackle child poverty we ensure that all family have early support and early intervention to ensure that they can thrive and that as she say problem do not escalate in the way that they currently do call the liberal democrat spokesperson the review of child social care carry out by the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister in find that without reform there could be almost child in care by cost an extra billion year so it be essential that we recognise the scale and urgency of this crisis and move quickly unlike the previous conservative government today announcement be therefore welcome step forward tackle profiteer will help not only to address the financial crisis face council but to deliver well outcome for our most vulnerable child and young people these be child for whom we in this place all bear huge responsibility and it be simply unacceptable that they have become cash cow for private equity company rake in profit of or more so could the secretary of state spell out when we will see these reform implement and when she anticipate the backstop take effect crack down on profiteer be only one side of the bargain to put provision on stable and sustainable footing we must also ensure that council can provide these service themselves where necessary so will the government work to support local authority in run child home where they want to do so and where there be need many of these private equity firm be also profiteer from special school and we be start to see they in the early year sector too be the secretary of state look at those area and will she apply some of today announcement to they new focus on family care be very welcome as early support for family can keep child out of care who do not need to be there kinship carer be unsung hero who often step up at moment notice to look after family member will the secretary of state please commit to move beyond the very limited pilot that have be propose to universal allowance for kinship carer on par with that receive by foster carer will she also take the opportunity offer by the employment rights bill which be currently before the house to legislate for pay employment leave for kinship carer all the evidence point to that lead to well outcome and it would achieve cost saving immediately not just in the long term the hon lady have rightly champion the cause of kinship carer for many year in this house and pay tribute to she for draw attention to this crucial area the measure we set out in the budget represent the single big investment in kinship care ever make by government this be an important first step but it be not the only action we need to take in this area will of course work with she and with member on both side of the house to make sure that kinship carer have all the support they need the hon lady be right that in this house we all bear responsibility to represent the need of vulnerable child whose voice be often not hear in our deliberation we will seek to bring forward measure as soon as parliamentary time allow because we know that the crisis we face be urgent yes we will work with council on the service they can provide either directly or by work with charity and other have see great example across the country of that already happen council need the government to give they further backing to do this on big scale and the plan we be set out today will provide for precisely that today be call time on excessive profiteering and if provider do not respond we will not hesitate to bring forward measure to cap their profit we be look very closely at special school too welcome this statement which those of we with care experience and those of we who have work in this area have want to see for year do my right hon friend agree that it be entirely regrettable that the work of my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister be commission by the previous government and then leave on shelf to gather dust will she reassure everyone work in this area that under this labour government every penny will go towards help young people to thrive not merely survive rather than line the pocket of profiteer pay tribute to my hon friend who have consistently share his personal experience and who have demonstrate to so many young people what can be achieve even when there be barrier to overcome he know as well as do that far too many care experienced young people in our country lack the support and backing that they deserve and we be determined to change that he be also right to point to the excellent work of my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister be delighted to have be able to set out many development arise from that crucial work there be so much more that we need to do together to put the right and need of vulnerable child at the heart of our policymaking call graham stuart thank you mr deputy speaker interruption do not mean to knock you down peg mr speaker that would be very unwise regret the secretary of state tone in response to the shadow secretary of state and hope that over time she learn not to adopt that tone on issue such as this the shadow secretary of state note that there be capacity crisis and the secretary of state have say that we need great early intervention now be the secretary of state confident that she have the resource to support local authority and other in tackle this twin challenge both part need to be tackle at the same time which be truly serious undertaking be not quite sure how to begin to respond to the frankly extraordinary first part of the right hon gentleman question to take the more serious point he raise we be determined to ensure that we have the resource and support in place for the most vulnerable child in our country the reason get so cross when hear some of the contribution make by conservative members be that during my time as shadow secretary of state and secretary of state have hear directly from far too many child who have be badly fail by this system it be shocking and shameful and we will change it year of inaction by previous conservative governments have lead to vulnerable child feel forgotten and council be financially crippled how will my right hon friend ensure that reform truly prioritise child wellbee and tackle profiteer at their expense my hon friend bring real expertise to this house from her work in education education be also crucial area where we need to work together on safeguarding school staff teacher and other have role to play in keep child safe and ensure that all child can thrive the step that we be set out today will make big change to the life chance and wellbee of many child across our country and be grateful for her support for that important work for far too long child service have be cinderella department be delighted that the secretary of state be shin light on they and drive positive way forward for they we need to ensure that our community be kinship and foster care friendly how will the secretary of state drive that agenda agree that there be still much more that we need to do to support kinship carer and foster family that be why the measure we set out in the budget be so important from speak to kinship carer in my constituency on friday know that there be still too many barrier in place include difference between local authority issue around access to mental health support and the need to do more to support kinship carer in balance work and caring responsibility look forward to work with the hon gentleman on those important area the almost kinship carer in portsmouth north welcome this government prioritisation of kinship care it be vital to keep kid with their family however not all child can live with their family so some live in the care system because of the past year of conservative government life have be too tough so will the secretary of state tell we little more about what this government will do to support those care leaver my hon friend be right to highlight the fact that sadly move to different kind of placement outside family care be necessary step for some child for their safety and wellbeing and in the interest of their long term future we be roll out the stay close programme nationally to ensure that all care leaver get the support they deserve we be also set out plan around corporate parenting to ensure that all of we fulfil our responsibility to the child for whom we be responsible be delighted to chair with the deputy prime minister the care leaver ministerial board because there be more that all of we across government need to do to ensure that care experienced young people have their voice hear and to ensure that we take action to address their concern five year ago bath and north east somerset council budget for child service be million this year it be predict to be million transport cost particularly be spiral out of control as private provider seem to deliberately place young people out of area what my council need apart from potential price control be capital investment so that it can rebuild its in house service will the minister commit to that agree that cost be spiral out of control more action be necessary to support council in invest in service and ensure provision for child much close to home too many child be be send far away from family support network that present local council with additional cost pressure and push many to the point of bankruptcy as well as deny child the life chance they deserve the secretary of state will be aware that local authority have legal duty to house unintentionally homeless people include those in priority need such as to year old care leaver and people with dependent child at the housing communities and local government committee we hear that shockingly over child be in temporary accommodation in england do the secretary of state agree that without urgent action on the housing crisis we will not see improvement for care leave child agree and the deputy prime minister be determined to drive forward change in this area not just with more home be build across our country include social home but by take action in the area that my hon friend describe when child be leave the care system assure she that the government will act in those area warmly welcome today statement the secretary of state be right that it be long overdue and that early intervention be key too many child in this country be in care because they and their family do not get the support and help that they need when they need it she reference the report lead by the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister which state that we need revolution in family help and specifically billion temporary injection of financial support to make the shift to prevention can she make that commitment be sure that my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington will speak for himself on his report the government recognise the need to rebalance the system away from crisis intervention and to break the cycle of spend ever more pot of money on what amount to failure within our system we will refocus our work on early support for family and ensure that there be more support for kinship and foster family that be important not just give the cost of the increase number of intervention most crucially it be how we will deliver well life chance for the most vulnerable child in our country have grow up in kinship care setting with my grandparent heartily welcome the content of the command paper have its provision be available to my grandparent would have have very different experience grow up so greatly welcome what the secretary of state be do however for those young people who have to enter the care system it can not be one way process age out can not be the only exit will she set out little more on what the paper will do to help with reunification so that young people who go into care can go back to their parent encourage she to look at the work of pause national charity that be do so much work with the birth parent of child who get take into care so that they get the help and support that they need after what can be very traumatic experience thank my hon friend for speak about his experience he will know that until quite recently this area be perhaps little understand it be so important that people like he be able to speak openly it demonstrate bravery and will encourage other to do the same will happily look at the report and the work that he mention and ensure that route back into family care for those child for whom that be possible be consider in our ongoing work in the london borough of sutton we start to in house some child care home provision back in and we now care for six child with complex need what assessment have the department make of the potential scale of local authority take on service directly if give the right support by the government like the hon gentleman have see good example of council across the country that have start to take such action but they have do so by go against the grain of government policy this time council will have the backing of the government in make those change we will also ensure that they can take action on regional basis work together and collaborate so that they can manage placement more effectively that way we will not just bring down cost to the taxpayer which be spiral out of control but ensure that child can stay close to family support network which be crucial to their long term future have spend year watch child service struggle in the way the secretary of state outline with serious case review often be the moment of intervention heartily welcome the emphasis on early intervention and what she say about the responsibility that we all have she will know that there have be much discussion about the concept of corporate parenting what be her think on that and what role do she see for we as members of parliament at the moment relationship across the country be clearly too inconsistent that be to the detriment of safeguarding and indeed of our young people my hon friend be right that there be many long stand challenge in this area on corporate parenting today command paper set out the step that we intend to take to bring forward further plan in this area look forward to work with she on the shape and scale of those plan because it be essential that we all take our responsibility incredibly seriously as know she do welcome the secretary of state broad commitment to reduce the number of child who need to go into care build on the comment of the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell want to emphasise the work that pause do with west sussex county council and other authority pause have vision of ensure that no one go through have child take into care more than once however more than half of area have no support available for parent after child be remove from

difference to the life chance of care experienced young people as part of that it be incredibly powerful to listen to the experience of two young people who have just come through the system and in all our discussion in this important area we must listen to the experience and view of those who have direct live experience of how the system have let they down and what need to change in future devon county council child service be assess by ofsted in april it find that the child front door service be effective after previously have be deem by ofsted to be inadequate when the secretary of

other mp in the previous parliament to plead with we to do something about the profiteer take place in the private sector nothing happen under the last government and we hear from the shadow secretary of state that if we do anything to try to curb that profiteer we will lose capacity agree with the secretary of state that council have great role to play do she agree that if council have their own provision that would empower they to prevent the profiteering be carry out by extortionate private provider agree with my hon friend who be right to identify that there be support for such measure across political party child be be let down by our failure and we must do more to improve capacity we will support council work together to do that have see great example of where that have happen but

the top four private provider on average be charge per child per week that be year per child do my right hon friend agree that only by cap that outrageous profiteering can we protect child but also get value for money for local council tax payer private provider be make in some case between and profit that be way beyond what we would expect in any other area crucially when we think about where they be make that profit it be off the back of the trauma abuse and sometimes very difficult early childhood experience of some of the most vulnerable child in our country my hon friend be right that the issue he identify in hartlepool be sadly feel right across the country he may wish to know that there be now more than child in placement that each cost half million pound every single year we have get to change that analysis by the local government association reveal that the top private child social care provider be make an average profit of it be frankly unacceptable that private firm be

that far we will be set out further step to make clear the funding arrangement but it be essential that we put more money into child social care we be do that and we will set out more in due course

the point he raise when it come to ensure that local council have role in the financial oversight of the system we will of course take his view into account the regime we will set out will allow we to provide much clear and great scrutiny those provider that be frankly profit shamefully from some of the most vulnerable child in our country be pleased to hear the statement on care leaver child who leave care have previously be let down by system that pretty much stop support once they leave care to ensure that care experienced young people can make the most of their future will the secretary of state outline the government plan to support care leaver in tamworth and around the country so that they can gain the skill and experience they need to thrive my hon friend be right to identify the urgent need to do more to support care leaver at the point when they move through the system and throughout their life that be why be work with the deputy prime minister and other government colleague

support they need we be also set out corporate parenting proposal to ensure that all of we pull together to listen to the view and experience of young people be sure that like she have hear directly from care leaver about how badly they feel fail by system that have not properly reflect their need and experience and it be vital that we put the need of care experienced young people front and centre in our discussion welcome the statement and the robust step the government be take for our child and young people be disappoint to read report by ofsted last week into the special educational need and disability provision in derbyshire which find there to be systemic failing and that the provision be inadequate our child and young people deserve so much well have the secretary of state make an assessment of how the previous government failure to deal with send have fuel problem in child social care do she agree that more integration be need between education healthcare local authority and provider include through integrate care board and partnership to deliver long last and sustain outcome for our young people agree with my hon friend that joint working be important and it provide much clear support for family who often do not want to have to repeat their experience time and again to different set of professional and who want well and more targeted support have see great example include in lewisham early this week where the pathfinder programme ensure that all child get the support they need through more timely intervention and through work closely with family know that derby city council have do some excellent work in that area there be an overlap between child social care and send and they have similar challenge we want to ensure that we share practice between those two area where possible child in care be some of the most vulnerable in our society and many people in sandwell be worried about child in small care home which often seem to lack oversight and regulation welcome the measure that the government set out today will the secretary of state ensure that ofsted have the power it need to inspect child social care and ensure that all home be suitable and safe place for child to be be grateful to my hon friend for share she and her constituent concern with the house we will act to ensure that ofsted have the power it need to tackle unregistered unsafe and unsuitable placement and accommodation our most vulnerable child deserve the good possible support and right now we be sadly far away from that the outcome for child and family involve in the child social care system be some of the bad in our country that be truly huge social justice issue so welcome the leadership show by the secretary of state and her team so soon in the new government time in office so many of the recommendation come from the contribution of those with live experience whether on regional care co operative expand corporate parenting the importance of unique child identifier and the change to ofsted that have be announce do the secretary of state agree that the contribution make to the review that lead by thousand of people with live experience who be often so unheard and unseen in society be validate by today announcement pay tribute to my hon friend for his tremendous work in this area be delighted that we have be able to act in many of the area that he identify as part of his review he be right to draw our attention to the thousand of people include those with live experience who contribute to his vital work it be testament to his work and their contribution that the government be able to take forward work in so many area that will make significant difference to the life and experience of vulnerable child across our country from today and over many year to come thank the secretary of state for her statement and the under secretary of state for education the hon member for lewisham east janet daby for her recent visit to my constituency in its exemplary work leeds city council be currently focus on small group home to bring child back to leeds from private provision outside the city which will give much well outcome and save significant cost and on early help and intervention the minister see all that work when she be in leeds will the secretary of state whose work on regional care co operative absolutely welcome clarify far what support will be available for local authority to consider alternative model of care over and above those co operative my hon friend local authority have do brilliant work in this area we be keen to build on the good example that already exist around the country know that my hon friend the under secretary be impressed with everything that she see as part of that visit we be determined to ensure that we back council and their ability to work regionally to deliver well placement close to home and to bring child back into their local area wherever possible my hon friend will know as do that child thrive when they be close to family and support network that allow for much strong and well life chance as they move into adulthood look forward to work with he to ensure that council have the power to do more we will set out more as soon as parliamentary time allow it be so refreshing to see labour secretary of state take action on profiteer in our local authority have be call for such action because in my constituency the average cost of an independent residential placement have increase by in the last five year despite that our labour lead council continue to fight to give decent and good quality placement to all our look after child do the secretary of state agree that tackle the practice of excess profiteering which be largely ignore by the previous government be exactly what we be elect to do to get value for taxpayer money and ensure that these vital service which look after our vulnerable child deliver the good possible outcome for child whom we be determined will succeed be grateful for all my hon friend work in this area she be right that council be leave at the mercy of private provider often pay extortionate cost for poor quality provision that do not deliver safety dignity and well life chance for our child we be determined to turn that around and look forward to work with she to ensure that child across our country include those go through the child social care system have their voice hear their struggle and challenge have too long be ignore under this government action will follow in my time as councillor and corporate parent nothing be more distressing than the complex safeguarding issue that we have to deal with and nothing more enrage that see people profit from they that be why calderdale council do good work to bring child home in house hope that the statement mean an end to that profiteer we be call time on the excess profiteering of big private provider which be see profit of to if they fail to act and bring down cost we will legislate to cap their cost this can not continue it have be leave to drift for far too long and local authority such as my hon friend have be up against it often face an impossible task but do great work where they can we will work with council include on regional basis to provide accommodation for child and young people that be close to home and of high quality with well standard and we will tackle unregistered and illegal provision it be brilliant to see secretary of state take this issue so seriously and get grip on it so early on in her time in government figure publish last week show that the number of child place far from home increase by over the last decade between and do the secretary of state agree that it be about not only capacity quality and cost but the geography of the placement to ensure that when child be place away from their family they can stay in touch my hon friend be right there be big difference base on geography find it quite astounding that of register place be in the north west of england that be staggering number and sadly it mean that far too many child be move far from home away from family network and move school or education provision we need to make sure that that change and that our most vulnerable child who have often be through incredibly traumatic early childhood experience and expose to thing that no child should ever see or witness get the good possible support and standard look forward to work with my hon friend to drive up standard and make sure that every child in his constituency who need support through child social care have much well experience and well adult life chance bus funding with your permission madam deputy speaker will update the house on our plan for well bus in england outside london when we talk about fix the foundation of our country our mind should turn to the nation most popular form of public transport because nothing prop up our economy more or well support our society than the billion passenger journey carry by our bus each year they be more than just take people from to they be lifeline for young and old in city or town bind we to job public service and opportunity from trip to the shop or doctor appointment to job interview bus shoulder the daily need of britain and in do so underpin every single one of our national mission that be why come what may this government will always back our bus like much of the economy our inheritance be dire some year of fail deregulation have turn many lifeline bus service into liability passenger be let down as they sometimes wait for hour for bus that do not turn up area be cut off as operator prioritise more viable route in town centre fare continue to rise and nearly million few mile be be drive than in none of this be inevitable or an accident but all of it be down to choice political choice pave the way for decline and place ceiling on the ambition of many especially the poor in society who catch time more bus than train enough be enough this government have choose to back our bus and the million who rely on they every day in last month budget we confirm more than billion in funding to improve service protect vital route and keep fare down today we be distribute that funding which mean more than million for local council to deliver bus service improvement plan and well meet local need and furth million for bus operator include fund long stand grant to drive down fare and drive up service in many place this be record investment and every region and authority in england will benefit especially area that be historically underserved such as rural area and small town council such as leicester the isle of wight torbay and cambridgeshire will see unprecedented level of funding for service route that be at risk will be save and passenger will see fast more reliable journey we be also put money into safe bus stop and more accessible passenger information so that our bus sector be fit for everyone be delighted that metro mayor have welcome the announcement with city region such as greater manchester west yorkshire and liverpool receive some of the big allocation that be not all we be commit over million to cap bus fare at ensure passenger do not face cliff edge of high price from next year particularly in rural area where bus be lifeline the current fare cap be only fund until december mean that without the action we be take some fare would have rise by we be not go to let that happen we be invest to keep fare down put money back in people pocket and to provide more frequent service so that more people can get to more place at more time of the day not only be we pro investment government we be pro reform government we will not hesitate to overhaul part of the system that simply be not work for passenger if that mean change to how we allocate resource we will make they if passenger need be not be meet we will prioritise they and if law be need we will introduce they we have call time on the way that bus funding have historically be allocate previously the government make council compete for funding waste resource and delay decision that be overly complicated lead to inconsistent funding and create uncertainty for authority and operator we be take fundamentally different approach we have allocate funding base on local need population the distance that bus travel and level of deprivation that put fairness at the heart of future funding and end the postcode lottery for bus service it ensure taxpayer money go to the area that be most in need where it will have the most impact and where passenger will most benefit this be the first stop on our journey to support local area to take back control of service and deliver well bus across the country finally we will introduce our landmark bus bill in the come week the big shake up of the sector for year this bill will allow council across the country to adopt franchising model as in greater manchester and london that mean local leader take back control of service ensure that route fare and timetable be all gear towards local passenger need this model work it have be over year since bus be bring under public control in greater manchester since then passenger number have grow reliability have improve and new service have be introduce road be now manage in way that work for bus mean that unexpected congestion or unplanned roadwork do not leave passenger strand that be what power in local hand look like it be why we be simplify the franchise process to ensure local leader waste no time in drive improvement for passenger we will also remove the ideological ban on publicly own bus company so that our bus can finally be run for the public by the public have say it before and will say it again when it come to our public transport we be move fast and fix thing after year of decline we be put passenger back at the heart of our bus through record level of investment and generational reform last month budget send the signal that even in difficult economic time this government will never take our bus for grant because we know that invest in bus mean invest in people in community and in the future growth of our country well bus be just few stop away commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for deliver her statement to the house and for advance sight of it it be of course the last government who provide billion of funding to the bus sector since alone some billion of that be allocate to support every single local transport authority in england to deliver their local bus service improvement plan help to support bus follow the pandemic and ensure more frequent more reliable and cheap bus transport across the country conservative members be familiar with the need to properly fund bus service but simply spend bit more money will not necessarily improve outcome as such we would welcome detail on whether and how the secretary of state can assure the house and the taxpayer that the money allocate today will actually go towards the improvement of bus service in the long term how will she ensure that the money allocate today and the bus service improvement plan that go with this investment will remain aligned with any possible future franchising if the secretary of state can not give assurance on these point there be danger that the government be take short term action that avoid face complex long term problem unfortunately in the four month that this government have be in office that have be their approach to every single major issue they have face so far whether it be the winter fuel allowance the family farm tax or the increase to the bus fare cap the government seem at loss as to why their policy be so unpopular and why only few month into this government they be so deeply distrust by the british public govern be tough and it require take real responsibility and consider the consequence of decision before they be take for example the decision to increase the bus fare cap from to will cost user wait for it it will cost user more and perversely put at risk passenger service on certain route because it could counter productively drive bus ridership down between and the bus cap cut fare outside london by and the rate be in rural and non metropolitan area in england that be an example of policy that work which be why the government decision to increase the cap by be such disappointment the right hon lady in defend her decision to hike bus fare have be make the argument she have do so again this afternoon that the fare cap be to run only until end of the year but as she know full well her back benchers can be excuse for not know this it be standard government practice to set funding arrangement until give date she have guarantee the cap only until the end of and have make no commitment to extend it beyond that she be also well aware that it be conservative party manifesto commitment to extend the cap and maintain it at for the lifetime of this parliament not extend the cap be not inevitable it be decision that the government choose to make why do the right hon lady government claim that they can not afford to retain the bus fare cap which be make real difference to the life of passenger and the viability of public service across the country and yet she can give hundred of million of pound in additional funding here without any guarantee of success in improve service or delivery while await the right hon lady answer have theory she be set on an undertaking the ideological drive for bus franchising and make no mistake it be ideological bus franchising do work in some place but by no mean will it work everywhere the government claim that they will not impose franchise everywhere but there be danger that her push for bus franchising will force local authority into feeling that they be expect to undertake this ideological venture one that they say they may well be unprepared and unequipped for which would lead to bad outcome for passenger call on the secretary of state to make clear her answer to those question and assure the house and the taxpayer that all the money allocate will be hold to account in deliver real and lasting service improvement for passenger whose interest should of course be at the centre of all decision make by the government be grateful to the shadow secretary of state for his question but have to say that will take no lesson from those on the conservative benches on good government the approach to funding allocation be base on need on deprivation on population and on bus mileage whereas his government waste million of pound in force area to compete against each other pick winner and loser raise expectation and leave some tory control area such as essex where be this morning with absolutely nothing from the bus service improvement plan process this formula and the funding allocate be fair arrangement ensure that every area of the country get the service level it need and can build the improvement plan that it want have to say that will also take no lesson on ideology for four decade england outside london have experience the fail deregulation of bus service lead to steady decline in passenger number this funding be back up by once in generation reform to our bus policy ensure that we can deliver well bus service in every corner of the country with public control back up by funding and government who believe in bus welcome the secretary of state million investment in the bus system across my constituency give the comment she have just hear do she agree that it take labour government to really understand not just the cost but the value of public transport and that our labour government be get on with the job of deliver well bus for our community be grateful to my hon friend for her support not only be we ensure record funding for the majority of area in this country we be push ahead with reform there be no point throw money at broken system as the previous government be so content to do be delighted that we be able to deliver well bus service for the people of luton call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement which warmly welcome as she make clear access to convenient frequent and affordable bus be vital they be critical to both employment and quality of life particularly in rural area sadly however too many part of our country lack decent bus service after year of tory neglect at time when we desperately need economic growth ensure comprehensive and affordable bus network be vital congratulate the secretary of state on secure the promise funding however we have some concern uncertainty still surround how local authority can seize the opportunity herald in the promise change to bus franchising furthermore if as the secretary of state believe bus be lifeline for young and old why be she hit bus user with increase in fare polling commission by the lib dems and publish last week show that the hike will make third of people less likely to use bus which will have direct impact on individual community small business and high street and will hit the most disadvantaged in society the hard it would cost just million year to retain the fare cap again ask she to reconsider would like to ask the secretary of state three specific question first when will she publish the full impact assessment on the bus fare cap commission by her department early this year secondly will she guarantee that the new power need for local authority to franchise bus service will be provide urgently so that bus route can be restore and new one add as soon as possible lastly although welcome the change to the allocation process and the rejection of wasteful and expensive competitive bidding between council will she confirm that the new more flexible system will not succumb to the temptation of pork barrel politic that we see so frequently under the last conservative government be grateful to the hon gentleman for those incredibly important question we have commit to publish the evaluation of the bus fare cap shortly we will introduce the well bus bill in the come week which will allow every area of the country to avail themselves of the franchising power and overturn the ideological ban on public ownership my department be also take much more proactive enable role with local transport authority make sure that they have the capability and capacity to move to franchising significant amount of the funding settlement announce today be specifically for capability and staffing in local transport authority finally on pork barrel politic the reason behind today funding be that we be not in the business of pick winner and loser we want to ensure that every corner of the country have the funding it deserve and the ability to avail itself of the style of bus that we have enjoy in london for four decade give that the conservative party record be cut in the bus service operator grant in the pound cut in local bus funding and bus service cut between and fall of more than half do my right hon friend agree that some of what we have hear today be bit rich my hon friend be absolutely right we see bus mileage and passenger number plummet under the last tory government the hon member for orpington gareth bacon talk about the funding that they provide but they be throw money at broken system this record funding for the majority of the country come alongside massive reform so that we can give back control and deliver the well bus that every corner of the country deserve bus usage after the pandemic be begin to recover in worcestershire thank to the bus fare and improvement to route we be campaign in malvern for well and more regular bus service between worcester and malvern include on weekend and for the reinstatement of the service we hop that we would be able to do that with some of the million of high speed money that be indicate for worcestershire could the secretary of state clarify what have happen to that funding and how it link to her statement be very pleased to confirm that worcestershire be receive million dedicate for local bus service million increase on this year of that million be revenue funding and can absolutely be deliver for the kind of bus service that the hon lady outline thank the secretary of state on behalf of resident in exeter and across devon who will be delighted with the million of extra funding for our bus system as look around the chamber it be very clear who take bus seriously and who do not devon and torbay have already be give the power to franchise and otherwise regulate bus service as part of the devolution deal sign off by the government this year yet tory run devon county council have specifically say that it will not use those power do she agree with that devon county council should take bus and passenger experience as seriously as this government be grateful to my hon friend we know that franchising work greater manchester go through the franchising process year ago and it have already drive up revenue and passenger number that have allow andy burnham to step in and use that revenue to keep his own bus fare cap at with the funding allocate today local transport authority can absolutely lower fare below the maximum of absolutely encourage area that already have the power to plan bus network that be appropriate for their community the department stand ready to work with devon and torbay to ensure that they can do that the new funding for bus service in somerset be welcome but my constituent often tell that they need bus rail link to connect area not serve by train station will the secretary of state outline the exact condition for what each tranche of money must be spend on to allow the council to plan much need improvement to service in rural area the way the formula have be design explicitly benefit rural area because third of the allocation be dependent on bus mileage that be why number of area include somerset have do much well out of today allocation than in previous year we be remove the control that be previously require all the funding will have to be spend on bus but we believe it be right that local transport authority take those decision themselves rather than be constrain by central diktat from whitehall thank the secretary of state for the million for kent county council as kent county councillor for little bit long have see the ridiculous bidding war and the hoop we have have to jump through for many many year will the money be ringfence for bus while allow kent county council the flexibility to spend it on the kcc travel saver fantastic initiative to help kid get around kent to local school will the money facilitate that be grateful to my hon friend for that important question we have lift control on the funding from the department we think it be absolutely right that kent county council should be able to decide where its bus money go the money will be ringfence to ensure that it be spend on bus but if area want to spend it on provide concession for young people or care leaver on buy new bus or on add new service that be entirely within its gift it be right that kent county council make those decision rather than passenger in many part of the country include in my constituency rely on cross boundary bus service for shopping visit friend and family and access vital public service too often however cross boundary service can feel like bit of an afterthought will the secretary of state look at how funding mechanism can be use to encourage passenger transport authority to properly integrate those service because community tie do not stop at county boundary be grateful to the hon gentleman for that important question which often hear cross border service can be an absolute lifeline for people travel out of area for work and we can absolutely consider that issue as part of debate on the well bus bill hope he will involve himself in that debate as it pass through the house it be time of optimism for everyone who use the bus in welwyn hatfield first after long labour party campaign we have double the frequency of one of the lifeline bus service to which the secretary of state refer between the urgent care centre at queen elizabeth ii hospital and the lister hospital secondly we have hear today the announcement of million for bus in hertfordshire be hop that my right hon friend can make it hat trick and confirm that local power will be give to people in hertfordshire to take bus back into public control may begin by say what an absolute joy it be to thank my hon friend the labour mp for welwyn hatfield he be absolutely right can confirm that the well bus bill will extend power to every local authority that want to avail itself of franchising because we be well aware that not every transport authority in the country be in either london or greater manchester the department stand ready to work with those in more rural area and with different type of transport authority and to look at different model to give they the flexibility that will enable they to build network that work for their community welcome the statement and particularly welcome the change in funding mechanism the move away from hoop jumping jam jar funding to something that take proper account of local need hope very much that it will take proper account of rurality however want to ask about another issue pensioner get free bus travel but child do not in my rural constituency the cost to people who do not fit the very narrow definition of those eligible for free bus travel be year be it not time to extend concessionary bus travel to child the hon lady be right and that be one of the reason why throughout next year we will be look at the bus fare cap and consider whether we can extend concession of some kind to young people the point of the bsip funding be that it can be use to deliver concessionary scheme as well the hon lady should encourage her local authority to think about whether some of the revenue funding that have be allocate can be deliver for young people more than people have already sign my petition on to protect the bus fare cap one young person explain how rise fare make it increasingly difficult for they to get to college while another describe public transport as vital lifeline against loneliness affordable public transport be essential not only to alleviate economic hardship but to address the climate crisis instead of increase the fare cap by to and cost ordinary people hundred of pound more each year why do the government not take page from the book of greater manchester labour mayor andy burnham who have commit himself to maintain the fare cap to ensure that public transport remain accessible to everyone the combination of andy burnham have franchise power and this transformational funding be the reason why he can keep the fare cap at in greater manchester the combination of this transformational funding and more power for authority in the rest of the country will enable they to keep fare low as well be disappoint that the secretary of state do not mention the west midland single time in her statement my constituent across meriden and solihull east rely on bus to travel to job job interview and education facility and to attend medical appointment do the secretary of state recognise that the most vulnerable people in my community and those who need bus the most will be hard hit by the increase in the bus cap this afternoon be delighted to meet the mayor of the west midland richard parker to talk about how he be take forward the bus power in the west midland be also delighted to announce the million funding settlement for the west midland which will be transformational for the hon gentleman constituent my constituent know that bus service be not good enough we welcome the announcement of more power and more funding for our area but sadly the conservative tees valley mayor ben houchen have rule out any exploration of give the public control of bus service can the secretary of state tell how we can get around the bus blocker to ensure that there be decent bus service for hartlepool constituent my hon friend be entirely right tees valley have do very well out of today funding settlement and would encourage the mayor to consider franchising option to deliver well bus service for the whole area can also confirm that through the well bus bill we will be lift the ideological ban on public ownership so my hon friend can certainly consider work with his local authority to set up publicly own bus company if the mayor do not choose to avail himself of those power my young constituent in bathampton who attend ralph allen school have to put up with an atrocious service they first have to go into bath city centre and then they have to take second bus out again halfway back to where they come from to get to school they often miss school because of the infrequency of the service and they pay twice direct service would be cheap well and safe bath council want to make service well and franchise they directly but the west of england mayor be prevent that will the secretary of state please urge the mayor to listen to west of england authority and allow they to franchise service directly and bring bus back under local control with her example the hon lady describe exactly what franchising be design to provide the ability to design the service that people rely on and ensure that schoolchildren have direct route to school would encourage all our mayoral colleague to take forward franchising for year the last government fail community with lack of investment in our bus service lead to few service reduce timetable increase unreliability and ultimately less control in in my area alone ten of million few bus mile be travel than in do the secretary of state agree that our town village and rural area depend on our bus and that the almost million announce for the north east combine authority will turn the page for my community which be let down so badly by the previous government my hon friend be absolutely right particularly in rural area bus simply be not good enough entire town and village be cut off with no bus service before am or after pm and that leave people with their ambition completely curtail be really pleased to have be work with kim mcguinness the mayor of the north east to ensure that through the well bus bill we speed up the franchising process and make available to she as quickly as possible the power to deliver well bus for my hon friend constituent the barnett formula comparability factor calculate how much money each devolve nation receive as consequence of uk government spending in england wales comparability factor for transport be now compare with for scotland and northern ireland can the secretary of state confirm whether this unfair funding arrangement apply to the new bus funding and will she say how much wales would receive in cash term if it have the same percentage share of funding as scotland and northern ireland will take away the hon lady specific question about the percentage and write to she but be pleased to meet ken skates the welsh transport minister just few week ago to talk about the welsh government own ambitious plan for bus franchising across wales they be learn the lesson from greater manchester and london and ensure that every constituent in wales will be able to benefit from well bus what fantastic day for every person in plymouth who use the bus we strongly welcome the secretary of state announcement that million will be invest in our bus over the next couple of year she say that that represent an investment not just in bus but in people and community that be fantastic to hear do she agree that today announcement represent the labour government invest in plymouth be very happy to confirm that we be invest in plymouth plymouth people and plymouth bus bus be an enormous engine of social justice because as say early the most deprived rely on they the most be afraid that be why they have be so badly neglect in this place for so long but that will absolutely turn around under this labour government bus be my priority and this labour government priority refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be member of norfolk county council be pleased that million of the new funding will be head to norfolk to support our rural bus service but the model for run bus in norfolk be break we need service that work for everyone not just rout to and from the city and the occasional shopping bus will the secretary of state assure that this money will not just disappear into county council coffer or route subsidy but instead help build the proper public transport network that north norfolk need the hon gentleman be absolutely right under the current system money have be throw hand over fist at operator which have cherry pick the most commercially viable route leave local authority to step in to subsidise the lifeline route that people rely on the benefit of area be able to move to franchised system or indeed to set up their own publicly own bus company be that they can cross subsidise properly across route and ensure that public money be spend in the good way and that we design route and network that really work for local community on friday meet member of the norwich scout group as part of uk parliament week and they have lot of question on transport they be particular concerned about the reliability and availability of bus could the secretary of state expand on how today announcement will support young people and how we can ensure that their voice be hear in this important conversation it be particularly important that we encourage young people on to bus so that they can develop well behaviour and carry on use bus throughout their adult life be delighted that we can confirm an additional million in revenue funding for norfolk that revenue funding will be available to norfolk to enable it to add additional service and improve the reliability and frequency of its local bus would like to acknowledge the significant investment in my constituency and say how welcome this will be after torbay first bus back well bid come back empty from the conservatives one of the issue that have lead to significant cut in our bus service be the recruitment of bus driver can the secretary of state advise we on how the government plan to enhance the opportunity for the recruitment of bus driver so that this money can be put to good use torbay be fantastic example of an area that have do well out of this funding settlement but be treat appallingly by the previous bus service improvement plan funding process the hon gentleman be right to say that the recruitment of bus driver be an issue that have plague certain part of the country and we be work closely with the department for work and pensions through its get britain work white paper to ensure that we can address recruitment and retention issue in the bus sector just few short week ago when the new bus franchising arrangement be announce in this place conservative members say that it would never work without funding attach now we have our answer and the billion of funding nationally and the million of funding for kent which have already be mention be hugely welcome and will certainly be big boost for my resident in dartford and also big boost to our effort to kick start growth in the thames estuary do the secretary of state agree that boost connection between our rural area and our town be vital to increase access to job my hon friend be absolutely right get very frustrated in the transport policy space because we often think of investment only in big infrastructure as mechanism by which to achieve growth but bus be essential to deliver growth in local community they connect people to job to opportunity to education and to each other so they be not only massive engine of growth but one of the most important engine of social justice available in transport policy term many of my rural constituent have comment that the level of the bus cap be irrelevant when there be no bus to use so welcome the extra funding today but do the secretary of state agree that it should be direct to ensure minimum level of service for all user rather than increase the frequency of service in urban area that be already well serve as have happen previously in the west of england the hon lady be absolutely right the big barrier to people get the bus be the absence of bus in lot of community and that be why we have direct this significant level of funding into community to ensure that it be invest in local bus service the benefit of move to franchising mean that we avoid add more and more operator and more and more service to commercially viable route and that we can design network that mean that more area and community be serve by the timetable and level of service that they deserve this be exactly what she address and it will allow minimum level of service that every area can expect may take this opportunity to thank the secretary of state for visit the good town in the country harlow this morning want to personally welcome the million of funding for bus service in essex which be hugely important do she agree that the hidden benefit of improve our bus service in essex will be to tackle social isolation which be particular issue in more deprived area where there be no reliable bus service be delighted to be in harlow with my hon friend this morning to announce record level of investment for essex another area that be badly underserve by the previous government someone mention early that bus passenger number have be increase since covid which be true but concessionary level be still far below where they be before covid be afraid that potentially highlight the real issue of social isolation and the hidden issue of old people not be able to access public transport only by deliver reliable accessible bus service can we tackle social isolation and give old people the service they deserve the million funding for somerset be clearly welcome although it be much less than be need consider that somerset be rat as have the bad county bus service in the country particularly welcome the ending of the lottery that set one community against another will the secretary of state congratulate the somerset bus partnership volunteer who work with my liberal democrat colleague now run somerset council prevent the previous conservative county council from close the park and ride get night bus go and have begin new transport hub since the bus station in taunton be close as result of conservative privatisation it sound like the somerset volunteer be do crack job be very happy to congratulate they and to welcome the million of funding announce for somerset today under the last government the number of mile travel on bus route in the north east fall by but that number also measure the region aspiration unfulfilled the opportunity lose and the job interview and family event that could not be attend very much welcome the near million of funding give to the north east in this announcement how will the secretary of state work with mayor such as labour kim mcguinness to ensure that the aspiration and opportunity of people in gateshead be give flight by this announcement my hon friend be right that the cut to his bus service be absolutely shocking behind every one of those cut be human story of opportunity and ambition curtail have be work closely with kim mcguinness on speed up the franchising process under the current legislation andy burnham take six year to bring single bus service under public control despite have be elect twice in that period on mandate to do so we want to ensure that we drastically speed up the process and reduce the cost to local transport authority and mayoral authority of get to franchising so that the money can be spend effectively on local bus service shropshire be one of the worst serve county in england for public transport have lose of its bus mile since compare with national average of about person in market drayton who want to get to the close hospital in telford which be minute car journey be look at five hour round trip on the bus we have only one service operate between oswestry and chester on sundays be afraid that be therefore quite disappointed by shropshire million revenue allocation in this round of funding will the secretary of state meet to learn about the huge transport challenge we face in shropshire and to see if we can do well be delighted to confirm that shropshire resource departmental expenditure limit allocation be million so the hon lady have already have furth out of today statement the government big reform to england bus system in year see the people of portsmouth

make an important point this government have put improve public transport at the heart of our priority in order to deliver growth and allow people to access opportunity colleague from across the house will recognise the picture he paint because time and again they will hear that the big barrier many business face to widen their labour market and ensure people can access opportunity be poor local transport that be why we be so delighted to announce this transformational funding welcome the secretary of state statement today that every region of england and wales will benefit especially rural area and small town in chippenham large agricultural industry base in the countryside be currently have to find private transport themselves to get shift worker in and out of their business the

constituency will the secretary of state ensure that those county that be not currently part of wide mayoral system get the funding they need college and large employer that use shift worker be two of the institution that often raise with their frustration about local bus service the problem with the current system be that nobody have the ability to require operator to run service accord to timetable or shift timing the move to franchising will allow local area to design such service and ensure that bus run when shift finish or college open or close the new funding formula model will ensure that rural area get the funding they deserve my right hon friend will not be surprised to hear that welcome the million settlement for the south east and the million settlement for kent which represent the big proportion of any allocation in the south east it be strike that in the past year there have be few bus mile in kent because of the last tory government will she join in challenge

of kent and this be record investment in they and their bus service the area be badly underfunde by the previous government and kent lose out repeatedly in the bus service improvement process the

the local government pension scheme in england and wales provide well outcome for saver while support investment for growth indeed we could unlock around billion worth for investment in private equity and infrastructure through those action alone accord to domestic and international comparison alongside economic stability and high level of investment the chancellor mansion house speech put reform at the heart of the government growth agenda the government approach to regulation be core part of that across our economy we will upgrade our regulatory regime review the guidance we give to the competition and markets authority and other major regulator to underline the importance of growth that include our financial service regulator while it be right that successive government make regulatory change after the global financial crisis to ensure that regulation keep pace with the global economy of the time it be also important that we learn lesson from the past those change have result in system that seek to eliminate risk taking and in some case they have have unintended consequence that we as new government must now address regulation have cost as well as benefit it have cost for firm when they be spend large sum on compliance and not use that money to innovate and to grow and it can have cost for consumer for example by restrict access to financial advice that could help they to plan for the future while maintain important consumer protection and uphold international standard of regulation we therefore feel that now be the moment to rebalance our approach and take forward the next stage of reform need to drive growth competitiveness and investment to support that aim the government issue new growth focus remit letter to the financial service regulator to make clear that the chancellor and fully expect they to support the government mission on economic growth the financial ombudsman service play vital role for consumer in get redress that will not

the government have launch consultation on captive insurance where new approach could cement the uk position as lead financial service centre as the house will know this government prioritise the growth of the mutual sector we have launch call for evidence on the credit union common bond ask regulator to report on their mutual landscape to support their growth and welcome the establishment of

call on they to go far and fast with clear action to reduce the level of fraudulent activity that exploit their platform and network we will be monitor that closely in the come month this be significant package to support the growth of the financial service sector and invest in the wide economy have hear lot of murmur from opposition members while have be speak which hope show their approval for our overall package look forward to work across the house to deliver these important reform from the first labour mansion house speech in year call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of her statement and congratulate the chancellor via the economic secretary on her maiden speech to mansion house it have go down broadly very well and we be pleased that she recognise the city for what it be the minister rightly point out that the uk host competitive and global financial centre but change to regulation must not be burdensome and they must be work through properly with the industry when and where the government take step to enhance the performance of that sector they can be guarantee of our support as the chancellor mention in her mansion house speech in generous tribute to her predecessor much of the regulation reform discuss today be start under conservative chancellor therefore wish to put on record recognition for my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt and the work he do in that area before turn to the substance of the statement inevitably will talk about the budget it be worth remind the house of the most pressing part of the chancellor budget which she leave out of her mansion house speech in her speech she mention the word growth no few than time but we have to look at the fact when the conservatives leave government we have the fast grow economy in the but now growth have halve the chancellor increase in national insurance mean that business be pick up the tab to pay for labour open tap on spending she will no doubt have read the letter send to she by hospitality business highlight job loss across their sector and wide range of sector despite all her talk about growth business group and economist agree that labour approach to the budget be choke the momentum of our economy britain deserve government who back growth empower investment and deliver prosperity hope that the minister today will admit to the british public that while she talk about growth her party plan to grow the economy fall short of an economic growth agenda on the substance of the reform that the minster have outline today we believe that the objective that the chancellor be attempt to achieve with her mansion house reform be broadly the right one first it go without say that delivery of the reform that the conservatives start in government be to be welcome include the focus on growth my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt legislate to ensure that financial service and market regulation have secondary growth duty it be regrettable that the government could not publish the final version of the pension investment review or the pension bill in time to accompany this statement as turn to my question should make it abundantly clear to the minister and the house that these reform must remain focused on deliver the good deal for pension saver while additional investment be welcome the pension market should not be treat as government cash cow for public investment if it lose sight of the paramount objective of deliver secure return for saver it be true that unlock great investment and deliver great return for pension saver can come together both can happen at the same time but must push for the publication of the fine detail of this policy the emphasis must still be on pension saver while great investment and great return can come together security in retirement be what the pension industry be all about work to reconcile those two aim be further by my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash when he announce reform early this year which include require pension fund to publicly disclose how much they invest in uk business compare with those overseas and disallow scheme that perform poorly for saver from take on new business from employer can the minister confirm that those reform remain government policy and that nothing she be announce today change those policy strand can the minister set out timeframe for the propose mega fund some local authority pension fund will be consolidate into just eight what be the criterion on which the government have choose eight why not one or the government note that the local government pension scheme in england and wales have asset split across different administering authority with local government official and councillor manage each fund can the minister clarify whether each of the local government pension fund will have stake in each of the eight mega fund or will they each be allocate to just one mega fund thereby possibly distort the risk profile of that pension fund the government state that the consolidation into handful of mega fund will enable the fund to invest more in asset such as infrastructure can the minster confirm whether the infrastructure that the government mention in their press release refer to both public and private infrastructure project on the topic of infrastructure what be the expected return on government own infrastructure project will pensioner ever be mandate to take low return to support the government investment objective the minister with responsibility for pension the hon member for wycombe emma reynolds who be in her place give rise to some ambiguity about whether there will be mandate of pension fund investment in government project in her financial times article this morning furthermore will the trustee oversee these mega fund be restrict by the government as to what they can invest in or will they be free to choose their investment and risk profile the government also state new independent review process will be establish to ensure each of the administering authorities be fit for purpose can the minister give any further detail on that review who will be run it for how long will it be run and what be consider fit for purpose how many of these fund would have to be consider not fit for purpose for the government to reconsider the number of mega fund to conclude we support what the government be try to do with their reform many of which be ours but question remain about the detail of the policy we will scrutinise the detail of the legislation when publish finish as start by say that the government be talk about investment and growth but have just deliver budget that downgrade growth and crowd out business investment those thing be not compatible and we urge the government to put forward workable plan for growth they must not rely solely on the financial service sector to bail they out thank the opposition spokesperson for his comment think he welcome the news although be not quite sure he speak lot about the ex chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt who do lot of work in this space remind the house that the ex chancellor say that there be much to welcome in the chancellor mansion house speech today the opposition have say that these be broadly good reform think would remind the opposition spokesperson of that also remind he that we be not interested in stick plaster politic we have long term vision for the economy which be why we be look at use the national wealth fund and the industrial strategy to ensure that we grow the economy will answer few of the hon gentleman question but if do not get to all his pension question the minister with responsibility for pension be happy to meet he point out that our public service be crumble and that we inherit billion fiscal black hole from the previous government we have to make difficult choice to fix the foundation of the country and restore desperately need economic stability in order to allow business to thrive he point out that hospitality business be contact he more than half of employer will see either cut to or no change in their national insurance bill to support the hospitality industry we be permanently cut business rate for retail hospitality and leisure from that come alongside relief on business rate bill next year for thousand of premise we be commit to deliver economic growth by boost investment and rebuild britain which be exactly what our budget do the interim report of the pension investment review which the hon gentleman have lot of question about put forward proposal to drive scale and consolidation in the define contribution workplace market the local government pension scheme be still consult the final version will come out in spring next year but as say the minister for pension be happy to speak to he there be international industry consensus that the scale and consolidation benefit investment and saver and that these measure could unlock around billion of productive investment on the hon gentleman question about the reform take autonomy away from local authority under the proposal in the consultation each administrate authority would retain control over the most impactful decision by set their investment objective and strategic asset allocation the consultation propose that implementation of the choose strategy be delegate to investment expert in the asset pool who be well place to execute the investment objective to meet the desire investment outcome hope that reassure he that we will not take autonomy away from the authority the hon gentleman talk about the overall package of boost uk economic growth and benefit pension scheme member the objective be complementary drive consolidation and tackle waste in the pension system ensure that scheme can achieve the necessary economy of scale and efficiency to pursue diversified investment strategy reassure he that asset such as infrastructure and private equity be see as part of the balanced portfolio and can enhance saver return they will boost economic growth so he do not need to worry about that and we will benefit the community where pension saver live the hon gentleman speak lot about what the previous government do they talk lot about pension but they actually never do anything we have show in the first few month of new labour government that we mean business and we have our action ready to go by next spring he will see the full detail in the bill

my hon friend about the remit letter for the financial conduct authority just as the pushmi pullyu in dr dolittle do not know which way to go there be danger that if we try to pursue the secondary objective while protect consumer consumer could lose out could she set out clearly how she expect the fca to ensure that it maintain its approach of protect consumer could she pick up on the comment from the hon member for wyre forest mark garnier about whether there will be any move to mandate pension fund to invest in uk infrastructure thank my hon friend for that question on pension fund we be not look at take that action right now but will let she know when we take further action on the remit letter we be commit to financial inclusion and to ensure that consumer be look after that be why in their remit letter have ask regulator to have regard to that and why have make it clear that our top priority be to promote growth and international competitiveness the laser focus in the remit letter be on growth but they be not intend to encompass the entire scope of the government vision for the sector she should be in no doubt that consumer outcome be top of our agenda have make that clear in every meeting have have with the regulator call liberal democrat spokesperson daisy cooper we welcome any reform that will provide an effective route to growth without put undue pressure on people saving so we look forward to see more detail from the government in the meantime press ministers on their broad goal of get investment in innovation constituent in st albans report that their small and medium sized enterprise have invest in innovation they have successfully apply for research and development tax credit only for his majesty revenue and customs to claw they back it be right that hmrc tackle error and fraud but thank to conservative inaction it be now widely accept that number of sme be see their valid claim reject or withdraw while other be simply not apply for the tax credit at all will the minister please conduct an urgent review of hmrc approach with particular focus on whether it be undermine the growth and innovation of the sme sector thank the hon lady for her comment will pass they on to the financial secretary to the treasury who will look into the matter be worried to hear what she say about sme she be absolutely right that they be the heart and soul of our economy we should be look into that will ensure that he write to she but if she need further meeting be sure he will meet she member from across the house have long call for financial regulation of buy now pay later company because of the delay in regulate those company third of people seek debt advice do so because of they the woolard report in identify the urgency of the fca regulate the industry as soon as possible welcome the government commitment to regulate they but be bemuse as many be as to why it will take until for the regulation to take effect and for our constituent to be protect everybody know that regulation need to happen and what the regulation be and the fca have be wait since to do it so why be we give these legal loan shark two christmases worth of present and allow they to exploit our vulnerable constituent in this cost of living crisis thank my hon friend for her question she have do an enormous amount of work in this area and applaud she for that she be instrumental in the government take our initial step to regulate the buy now pay later sector there be need for buy now pay later during cost of living crisis and people will access those company product but have bring this under fca control so far and have regulate to ensure that it be safe and that people do not store up huge amount of debt that they can not pay back the consultation be open until november and ask she to urge other to feed into it to ensure that we get this policy right that be not do by the previous government will bring forward legislation as quickly as possible but think it be important to hear what people and the industry have to say because we want to regulate properly she be be patient and ask she to be bit more patient our intention be to make the sector as well regulate as possible under the fca warmly welcome much of what be announce last week the work on listing mutual and the remit refresh but say to the hon lady and the minister for pension that there be considerable reticence in the pension industry when it come to many of the driver of change highlight last week we need complete cultural shift and change in appetite from those who lead the pension industry urge she to keep under review the fiscal incentive and the transparency and accountability rule so that we can see the performance gap that result from not make some of these change look sympathetically on the aspiration that she have set out today and wish she well as she move forward with these critical change which should have lot of support from across the house know that the right hon member do huge amount of work in the financial service sector while he be in office the civil servant still talk about how amazing he be much to my dismay sometimes we agree that there need to be change in appetite in this place transparency be top of the list as the minister for pensions just whisper in my ear we thank the right hon member for his constructive approach on the review and urge he to tell the people he know in the sector to respond to and feed in to the consultation the minister will know that investment in our energy system be vital to our mission of be clean energy superpower create job and cheap clean and more secure home grow energy to power our economy what be she do to ensure that financial service regulator support the government mission while uphold high industry standard know that my hon friend take keen interest in this area she be talk about it for the year that have know she we agree that it be important the fca and the pra be require to have regard to the uk net zero emission target as set out in the climate change act the mansion house speech set out the government next step to deliver world lead sustainable finance framework that will be huge part of our financial service strategy as part of the industrial strategy next spring urge she to consult and feed in on that speak as former trustee of local authority pension fund much of the correspondence that receive from pension fund member be not about the return that they receive but about the investment they be in but could not choose to come out of because it be define benefit scheme appreciate that the review be ongoing but can the minister confirm that any review will consider retain the autonomy of local authority in decide not to invest whether in company country or sector for environmental social and governance reason the consultation be ongoing but repeat that each administer authority will retain control over impactful decision by set out investment objective and strategic asset allocation and they will have control over their pool asset the minister for pensions will be happy to meet the hon lady should she wish to discuss that far as the hon lady say herself the consultation be ongoing so she may wish to wait until after it be complete declare an interest as proud labour and co operative mp it be great to see the chancellor outline the ambition to grow the co op and mutual sector and to see regulator come forward in that work be there timeframe for that process as the minister say to ensure the growth of the uk economy we need rich and diverse growth in the mutual and co operative sector as well as my hon friend say she stand on ticket as labour and co operative member of parliament and she have do lot of work in that area last week the chancellor set out multiple new measure to unlock the full potential of the mutual sector as we outline in our manifesto that include publish call for evidence and reform the credit union common bond and ask the pra and the fca to report on the current mutual landscape by the end of declare an interest as trustee of the parliamentary pension scheme there be lot to welcome in the chancellor mansion house speech lot of which be take from the mansion house and edinburgh reform of the previous chancellor particularly welcome the increase in access to financial advice that the minister have say she be take forward can the minister confirm the end of the senior manager regime in the city which believe be in the chancellor speech and if that be the case how do she plan to take it forward and will it require primary legislation the government will consult on replace the certification regime and will seek the view of industry and all interested stakeholder in do so we be work closely with the pra and the fca on that if the hon lady mean certification of the senior manager regime we be keep that under review at the moment but it be not mention in the way that she think it be before the election labour set out plan to grow the mutual sector in our financing growth report which be welcome across the sector in fact my local credit union the caledonian credit union welcome the report declare an interest because be now member of that credit union after visit welcome the setting up of the mutual and co operative business council will the minister explain how that will drive growth in the sector as my hon friend know the mansion house speech set out multiple new measure to unlock the full potential of the mutual sector as he say we welcome the establishment of an industry mutual and co operative business council alongside our delivery of legislation to support the building society sector last month we want to ensure through those measure that the sector can grow and to support inclusive growth across the uk in the few month that have hold this position the main complaint in the mutual and co operative sector seem to be that it be difficult to operate within the current regulatory framework as it be not set up to support mutual and co op in the way it support other business so be look at that be very happy to continue that conversation but this be about consider the regulatory framework to ensure that it be for fit for purpose in double the mutual sector which be commitment in our manifesto in her mansion house speech the chancellor announce that we would change the emphasis of regulation from risk to growth the fca and pra have effectively regulate the london market into terminal decline embed stonewall philosophy and diversity equity and inclusion into financial regulation start with the financial services and markets act that be follow by the market in financial instrument directive and ii which import eu regulation into the london market prioritise european bank lending model over our equity capital market tradition give that regulator can not regulate for growth the only solution be to disband the fca and pra and return to the light touch regulation under the bank of england that secure london position as vibrant capital market until could the minister explain with clarity the government strategy of regulate for growth which appear to to be an oxymoron our regulator do very good job and we be lucky to have they but we will hold they to account when the chancellor talk about risk taking she be say that the post financial crisis regulatory change create system that seek to eliminate risk but which have go too far and lead to unintended consequence for example the certification regime have help to improve standard and accountability but some element have become overly costly and administratively burdensome that be what we be look at get rid of the regulator be not the way to grow the economy hold they to account and consider how we increase risk take in our system be the way in which this government will approach thing as long term member of the nhs scotland credit union know the importance of have community and workplace base saving and lending provision which be much more accessible for people on low income than buy now pay later however it have become much more challenging for the sector to operate beyond the common bond what be the minister do to ensure that credit union be able not only to compete with the wide financial sector but to thrive in those circumstance absolutely share my hon friend enthusiasm for credit union have visit those in my constituency several time and know what good work they do we have make clear our strong support for the mutual sector we recognise the value that credit union bring to their member in local community include in her constituency the chancellor launch call for evidence on reform the credit union common bond during the mansion house speech last week we want to understand whether reform be need in that space to help credit union to grow substantially once we have complete the call for evidence we will consider how much of that reform we can take forward as labour government the pensions minister will be all too aware of the ongoing problem face member of the west midland pension fund one of the country large public sector pension fund why do the economic secretary think that the chancellor eight mega fund will provide well service than the west midland pension fund in invest those people pension we will build on the success of the pool that already exist if the hon gentleman be not satisfied with my answer the minister for pensions be happy to meet with he much like my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi be proud member of the co operative party so to have so much co operative and mutual content in the mansion house speech the new co operative and mutual business council in particular be music to my ear will the minister say little more about how she anticipate that ministers will interact with the new business council will her treasury colleague consider new financial instrument to help co operative and mutual meet the growth that they know be available to they know that my hon friend be an active member of the co operative and mutual movement the government have already take the first step with two statutory instrument lay on october we be committed to progress the remain change to the building societies act follow royal assent of the building societies act amendment act will look at further si to try to further the work here but want to support the industry lead council and welcome the opportunity to work with it and discuss and test policy proposal with representative and expert from across the sector know that view be share across the treasury include by the chancellor who ask about it this morning in our ministerial meeting invest in small pension fund be boring because it be risk averse safe for beneficiary and principally concentrated in this country while investment in uk start up and tech through venture capital and other vehicle be to be warmly welcome if it happen there be nevertheless very real risk that fund will simply be invest overseas and the canada experience suggest that that may very well be the case what assessment have the treasury make of the extent to which the small pension fund that the minister envisage be amalgamate will simply have their capital and investment lodge overseas in the tech and start up company of other country and deprive our own of the same we be look at diverse portfolio of asset and the pension fund mention by the right hon gentleman have already pool and be invest in the uk bournemouth be wonderful place to represent for lot of reason one very good reason be the presence of large finance sector we have jp morgan and nationwide building society which be pleased to visit recently and hear from about its aspiration over the last year that sector on the south coast have be starve so what step will the minister and this government will take to support coastal finance hub moreover recognise that her diary will be quite book up but can invite she to come to bournemouth and meet with representative of those firm if she do be happy to buy she an ice cream my hon friend will know that can never resist an ice cream so probably will visit after all place such as jp morgan which employ people in the financial service industry be vital to we one of the thing that the chancellor speech build on be the significant step that the government be already take to enhance the competitiveness of our financial service sector we want to look at the big change to the uk listing regime in more than three decade and my hon friend will be familiar with this deliver the final stage of the post crisis capital reform to bank with our financial service growth and competitiveness strategy which hope my hon friend will write to we on we want to give the industry certainty and the confidence to invest that be the main thing that the financial service sector want right now and people in bournemouth will probably agree with that look forward to that ice cream thank the minister for her statement we must welcome the news that london edge close to new york as financial hub however the minister be aware that growth happen only if we attract investment believe that the decision to pool pension fund into large investment vehicle be bold one yet the chancellor must ensure that guarantee be in place so that the mega pool of pension do not go down the drain and that guardrail be in place to safeguard the nation pension pot reassure the hon gentleman that boost return for saver be at the very heart of this agenda which be why we be pursue this pension review we want these reform to increase security and boost people pension pot and we want to unlock about billion of productive investment the government reform be already in the pension scheme bill and they could boost typical define contribution saver lifetime pension pot by do not want the hon gentleman to worry because we have our eye on how to protect pensioner and saver in my constituency of mansfield our member own mutual organisation mansfield building society provide essential banking service it be significant local employer and invest in project to support my community what be the minister do to unlock the full potential of the sector and organisation such as mansfield building society have already mention our first step with the two si lay on october which try to modernise the building societies act and be happy to send my hon friend further information on that the main thing we will do be carefully consider the finding of the law commission review to understand whether reform of the legislation be need to ensure that business be well support and grow more in the future the response to the call for evidence will be carefully consider by myself and other and any potential reform will require formal consultation want to make sure that my hon friend know that at the top of our agenda be try to unlock the full potential of this important sector after year of that not have happen thank my hon friend the minister for share her statement and welcome the support that it have gather from across the house however note that the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison mention concern about pension member will of course remember that it be the conservatives who cause chaos in the market with their mini budget put all our pension at risk what will the government do to ensure financial stability and make sure that there can be no repeat of the chaos that they cause my hon friend know this area well have work in the treasury in former life we will absolutely make sure that we avoid the mistake of certain liz truss and work very closely with the tpr and the fca to deliver all our reform and ensure that we do not make any decision that shake the stability of the economy because we want to have stable financial service sector and stable economy to encourage investment and ultimately deliver on our growth mission portsmouth people welcome the national wealth fund the industrial strategy and the chancellor mansion house speech as well as the stability that it offer our country and its much need economic growth do the minister agree though that consumer protection be vital issue that we must ensure do not get lose in our growth strategy will she say what the government be do on this agenda to ensure that consumer protection be at the heart of anything that we do in financial service as well as be minister be constituency mp every time have one of my surgery hear about people who have be either victim of fraud or take out buy now pay later product without realise the consequence we want to give enhanced consumer protection to people through the financial ombudsman service but we be very aware that it need to be reform which be why the chancellor mention it over and over in her speech we plan to introduce legislation on that as soon as possible because we want to deliver well protection for million of consumer after year of uncertainty be also make progress on financial inclusion at the moment and can send my hon friend more information on that if she want we be set up financial inclusion committee which be meet next week and be happy to let my hon friend know what we be do in that to protect consumer point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker thank you for provide time for this important question last thursday in this place during an urgent question to the minister for health and social care the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter begin tirade against the scottish government at holyrood worse still the minister echo she in respond in my humble opinion that be waste of valuable ministerial time during westminster urgent question this place be increasingly see such political posturing when we be try to honestly and earnestly deal with westminster business not devolve holyrood business believe that the responsibility for this charade lie directly with government whips who be continuously plant question with back benchers be it in order during urgent question to ministers for government back benchers and indeed government ministers to raise matter that be completely devolve to the scottish parliament and unrelated to the urgent question at hand thank the hon member for his point of order and for give advance notice of it he will be aware that there be no general rule against member refer to matter that be devolve to scotland there be some restriction on the tabling of question on devolved matter but those restriction be far from absolute question that relate to various matter include those in which uk ministers have take an official interest be permit more generally as ever what right hon and hon member may say in the house be subject to the discretion of the chair on point of order madam deputy speaker on thursday november table uq that be successful in supplementary question the hon member for kingston upon hull east karl turner say that he be disappoint to put it mildly that be unable to mention any of the funding that the government have put into the nhs in the two minute that speak mention that fund three time have since write to the hon member to make he aware of that he have apologise however look for your guidance on how he may correct the record be grateful to the hon member for have give notice of his point of order as he well know the chair be not responsible for the accuracy of hon member speech but he have put his point on the record and confirm that he have write to the hon member for kingston upon hull east be sure that settle the matter armed forces commissioner bill second read relevant document correspondence from the defence committee to the secretary of state for defence on the armed forces commissioner bill report to the house on november beg to move that the bill be now read second time today the government take major step to strengthen support for our armed force and the family who stand behind they the first duty of any government be to keep our nation safe and at the heart of that security be the man and woman of our armed force in this role have the privilege of meet many of those man and woman who serve proudly here in the uk and around the world see at first hand their dedication and professionalism and some of the extraordinary sacrifice they make in defence of our nation from the personnel who rapidly deploy to cyprus over the summer to support our contingency planning for the safety of uk national in lebanon to the royal navy submariner who meet recently at faslane as they complete the final leg of their sea patrol have to apologise that mine be the first face they see upon arrive home after so many month on all side of the house we thank those man and woman for such service know too that all member will join in recognise that when we talk about love one away from home spouse or parent who may be deploy at moment notice to another part of the uk or the world we be talk about sacrifice that be make not only by those in uniform but by the family member who support they we can not say enough that our force family live their life in service to the nation as such the bill before the house establish an independent armed forces commissioner to improve service life for our serve personnel and their family that be significant and long overdue thank the secretary of state for give way and welcome his armed forces commissioner bill as he have rightly point out the bill will allow our brave service personnel and their family to make complaint to the commissioner but that right have not be give to bereave family member can he reassure and the house that bereaved family will also be give that right can indeed our definition of relevant family member which be on the face of the bill will include bereaved family of course the other group exclude from that provision be veteran speak as veteran why be the secretary of state not concerned about they should they not come under the auspex of this new official too an example might be those who be expose to potential contaminant at camp lejeune in the us that be thematic investigation that the new commissioner might undertake our first priority be those who serve and their family those who be subject to service law the range of agency and service that support veteran be very different well way of improve support for veteran will be to fully implement the armed force covenant in law as well as the range of step that the minister for veterans and people my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak al carns have already start to take we have take the view that the commissioner establish by this bill will give their first priority and full focus to those who be serve as well as their family who be also impact by their service life as have say this bill be significant and long overdue it be long overdue because the force have be badly let down for the past year the conservatives have create crisis in recruitment retention and morale last year the train strength of the armed force fall at the fast rate for decade with more personnel leave than join every month and service morale fall to its low level on record only four in of our force personnel report be satisfied with service life they report that the impact on family and on personal life be the lead factor influence their decision to leave the secretary of state will know that while the previous government systematically fail community around the country do their good to support serve personnel and their family through military covenant some do that really well while other do not could the secretary of state say little more about what role he see for covenant in the work of the armed forces commissioner to ensure that commitment make in good faith by agency around the country be deliver on so that serve personnel and their family can have easy more rewarding life the covenant set out the important principle that no one who be serve or who have serve should be disadvantage by that service that be why as an opposition party before the election labour support the then government in their partial translation of the covenant into law the job be only half do and we will complete it we aim to do so through the armed force bill that be to come but although the role of the commissioner will exist in the context of the covenant they will draw their power from the legislation before the house their role will be define in this legislation and they will become powerful independent voice for those who serve and the family who stand behind they both our force and their family have be fail for too long that be why the government be determined to renew the nation contract with those who serve it be why the government be put people at the heart of our defence plan and why be now introduce this legislation as priority in the first legislative session of this government we can not reverse those deep set problem overnight but our mission be to lift military morale and in these first four month we have be get on with that job we be invest in our servicemen and woman give they the high pay rise for over year we be put force family first expand childcare for force family overseas we be start to fix force recruitment with new recruitment target cut red tape and new direct cyber route to recruit into the armed force we be also improve service life by introduce this bill in parliament to establish the armed forces commissioner government deliver for defence and deliver our manifesto commitment to establish that commissioner as an independent champion for our force and their family to improve service life the commissioner will be direct point of contact for serve personnel and their family who will be able to raise concern that may impact on their service life and their ability to serve everything from kit to food housing medical care study programme promotion childcare and support for spouse in work the role be inspire by the long establish german parliamentary commissioner for the armed force which enjoy cross party support in the bundestag and support across the military dr eva högl the current commissioner in germany tell since the year the german commissioner be first establish it have become well recognise respected and unchallenged as an institution in germany safeguard the basic right of our soldier she go on to say would be delighted if this success story be to be repeat in the uk that be exactly what we aim to do the commissioner will have the necessary access to personnel information and defence site they will have the power to hear directly from service personnel and family member on their concern connect with their service and the power to investigate individual concern and launch wide range thematic investigation into those issue that materially impact personnel and family of the force they will have the power to demand access to information to facilitate their investigation and access to service premise and in the uk to make those visit unannounced how do the secretary of state envisage the commissioner stand alongside other in the armed force in term of the chain of command have an assessment be make on that the commissioner will be independent and separate from the chain of command with power that do not depend on or account to the chain of command in any way they will have the power to make recommendation to improve service life and to set out the finding of their investigation in report to be lay before parliament their annual report will be an independent report to parliament on the state of the force and what we must do to improve our offer as government and as nation to those who serve it be my intention that debate on that report become regular part of the parliamentary calendar each and every year the commissioner and their report will challenge ministers will strengthen parliamentary oversight and will raise awareness of the issue face our force the commissioner will be subject to pre appointment scrutiny by the commons defence committee the secretary of state be be generous with his time note from the bill that there be no prospect of approval be seek from the cross party defence committee although as the secretary of state just allude to there will be pre appointment hearing will he give and the house an undertaking that if the committee have concern he will listen closely to our recommendation and take action accordingly be grateful to the select committee chair for intervene on this point the legislation and what propose reflect the current arrangement and practice in parliament be keen that the committee exercise the tough pre appointment scrutiny we need to appoint somebody who can do the job as fearless independent champion and will certainly listen closely to and take close note of the committee view in any pre appointment hearing the bill also provide for the commissioner to absorb the exist power of the service complaints ombudsman of course the ombudsman role be too narrow it be entirely reactive it can consider formal individual grievance only after the service complaint system have be complete and then it can judge only whether that process have be reasonable expect that the armed forces commissioner will challenge we to do well in the service complaint system and widely across service life expect that the commissioner will develop strong view on improve the service complaint system and believe that the future armed forces bill will offer we the right opportunity for that should primary legislation be require this be landmark legislation to establish an independent armed forces commissioner with the mission to improve service life there will be for the first time champion for our armed force for the first time champion for force family and for the first time champion with serious power to access every part of service life who will report in public to parliament commend the bill to the house call the shadow secretary of state at all time and on both side of the house we should want to ensure that our armed force have our back and that their morale and the offer from the mod be as strong as possible the opposition recognise that the bill introduce manifesto commitment for which the government have clear mandate and moreover that it create new mechanism by which the mod intend to boost the day to day experience of our armed force personnel no one could disagree with that goal while it remain to be see exactly how the bill will deliver in practice we will not oppose it but will be constructive critical friend because the least that those who bravely put their life on the line to defend our country deserve be proper scrutiny from parliament in matter of legislation and the armed force of course there be area of welfare not directly affect by the bill where we want to see further progress but in term of the bill provision we wish to probe number of matter at face value there be clearly merit in seek to ensure extra accountability for how welfare matter be conduct in the force note in particular as the secretary of state just stress that the commissioner will explicitly not be draw from the rank of either the military or the civil service precisely in order to deliver genuine independence in many way that provision be not dissimilar to the principle that want to see in the integrate procurement model back in february with the idea of second opinion in procurement not least from the defence science and technology laboratory and the science base the point be to ensure that major procurement programme and the requirement request from the single service could similarly be subject to genuine challenge and transparency after all the sheldon inquiry focus on transparency and openness as key tool to guard against the bad culture that can pertain without confidence for military personnel and official to come forward and air their concern what we call be psychologically confident therefore in principle the proposal appear to be consistent with the push for more transparent culture in defence that make it hard to hide embed problem the most serious such example could include the issue raise by the lyons review and the defence committee woman in the armed forces report as refer to at oral question early by the hon member for south shields mrs lewell buck as such if the new office of the commissioner genuinely expose cultural weakness and hide systemic problem that would otherwise not have be disclose or would take long to emerge it should be welcome that say such extra transparency can not be at the expense of operational effectiveness that be why one of the most significant issue that we will want to probe far be the interaction between the commissioner and the chain of command especially in sensitive operational setting the bill state that visit will not be permit on national security ground but what if the commissioner and the chain of command disagree on whether those ground apply will the secretary of state adjudicate if so how will that work in practice as my hon friend the member for spelthorne lincoln jopp allude to in his early oral question how will such visit work in practice without disrupt live operation we must have clarity off the back of the armed forces service complaints and financial assistance act the previous government do much work to reduce bureaucracy shorten the complaint process and strengthen oversight it be important that that be not undermine through the organisational upheaval that the bill will inevitably generate what step will the government take to ensure smooth handover especially in relation to exist casework few of our colleague have experience that recently on the territorial application of the bill as thing stand there be permissive extent clause that enable an order in council to provide for relevant section of the legislation to extend to the channel islands the isle of man or any of the british overseas territory except gibraltar first what be the rationale for apparently exclude gibraltar secondly what of the us visit force as minister for defence procurement with responsibility for the estate visit both lakenheath and mildenhall in my county of suffolk where there be significant presence of us force and have the pleasure of meet the then command officer major general campo there be significant number of infrastructure planning and other matter where inevitably the usvf need clearance and input from the uk mod what will the commissioner responsibility be in relation to usvf particularly where british personnel be station alongside they similarly what about the personnel of the many nation assist with training ukrainians for operation interflex on the uk basis my right hon friend the member for south west wiltshire dr murrison make very good intervention we agree that we want to question the point about veteran and we will probe that in committee finally on cost we note that the department expect the annual cost of the commissioner to be high than that of the current ombudsman and overall in the region of million do the secretary of state anticipate that the cost will grow far and above that estimation in the year ahead as the commissioner become more established more broadly we know that many issue affect morale recruitment and retention in the armed force we want the bill to succeed but there remain number of area of concern where deliver well offer to our service personnel be critical on recruitment and retention hopefully all hon member understand the critical importance of boarding school to service family and that there be very few place not in the independent sector boarding school provide stability for their child in career that do not automatically lend itself to such yet family affect by vat on school fee will not find out until december exactly how they will be hit by tax that commence the very next month let we remember that many such family do not receive continuity of education allowance and will have to cover hike in fee from their tax income that be why the opposition want the type of vat exemption for all child of service family that be offer to child with special educational need and disability with an education health and care plan do my hon friend agree that it be just not fair on the small business that be independent school such as warminster school in my constituency which traditionally have take significant number of service pupil to have that level of uncertainty about what the school roll will look like in january that be an excellent point pay tribute to those sort of school and how they share in society commitment to our armed force it have be labour policy since the general election seven and half year ago to introduce vat on school fee family who have personnel serve abroad this christmas will have just december to deal with whatever those new fee mean for they that be shockingly short amount of notice on pay we agree that those who serve their country must be appropriately reward which be why in we announce core armed force pay rise of plus far consolidated increase of equate to rise of approximately for the most junior rank and include freeze in food charge alongside pay accommodation be an important part of the offer from the mod we all accept that much more need to be do and presumably that will form key focus for the commissioner stand by what say in the remembrance debate the problem be the underlie structural nature of so much of the accommodation in the defence estate for that reason as minister want to see we potentially buy back the defence estate in england and wales from annington so that we could plan full rebuild and regeneration of the estate the long term solution that think the veterans minister refer to early hope the government will take that work forward but appreciate that it be highly legally and commercially sensitive and there be limit to what they can say on that as for the short term the lesson from our winter plan last year be that investment and plan for the defence estate can still yield result early on as the minister responsible for the estate in accept that the previous winter we have let down service family and with the backing of ben wallace and then grant shapps we secure million in the defence command paper refresh and deliver winter plan that see thousand of home treat for issue such as damp and mould complaint to contractor fall sharply between and winter that bring to the final critical point funding the new commissioner will almost certainly be assail with accommodation case but any report that he produce will inevitably form one conclusion there be need for more investment in the estate at time when there be many other compete priority the million that we announce require we to make choice about spending and to prioritise accommodation and the welfare of personnel over other pull on funding it be incredibly important that the government commit to spend of gdp on defence as soon as possible the secretary of state will inevitably say that the last time we reach be in could as easily say that the last time we reach be in they be two point on pathway of consistently fall spending since the cold war because successive government believe like many around the world that we be in more peaceful era that be statement of fact the point be that welfare in the military be about we as nation and government say to those who serve we have your back that be impossible without more funding and that mean set definitive date for get to the conservative party will always support the welfare of service personnel that be why we will try to work constructively with the government on the bill we will not be divide the house this evening call the chair of the defence committee no one could argue with the honourable intent of the bill to improve service life that be why there be widespread support for its main proposal an enhanced role with new investigative power the service complaints ombudsman and her predecessor have both call for power along those very line this be commitment in the manifesto on which my right hon friend the secretary of state and stand for election the defence committee publish letter last thursday set out our initial thought on the bill to inform the house scrutiny today we have hop to have time to take account of the view of representative of armed force community as well as the service complaints ombudsman but the pace of event make that impossible as result at this stage my remark contain more question than conclusion if the government be to be judge by their own success criterion the two key question for the house be these first how far will the bill go towards improve service life secondly be the commissioner establish by the bill give the right power protection and resource to act as the strong independent champion that our gallant armed force and their family deserve and that the government have promise on behalf of the defence committee ask the minister for the armed forces to address in his wind up speech the point that we raise in our letter in addition to those that the defence secretary outline early what be the government priority for improve the service complaint system it be strike that the bill contain only one change to the system when successive ombudsman have find that the system as whole be not efficient effective and fair to bring the bill to life can the minister draw to the house attention example of time when the power to conduct investigation on general service matter would have improve service life if it have exist at that time it would be helpful if the minister could clarify as far as possible who will be able to ask the commissioner under clause to investigate general welfare service matter will that include member of the reserve force family member of reservist former partner and spouse of serve personnel and the secretary of state have thankfully already provide clarification on this bereaved service family this be matter of interest and concern to representative of armed force community such as the royal british legion the independence of the commissioner will be crucial in maintain the confidence and trust of the armed force community be listen carefully to what the hon gentleman have to say may tempt he to agree with that the armed forces commissioner should have his or her power extend to veteran on the ground that lot of the theme that he or she would look at would be hybrid matter that affect both the veteran community and those currently serve at the risk of be accuse of be one trick pony may suggest that the camp lejeune case exemplify that point would never accuse my right hon friend of be one trick pony he tempt but would like to consider that point about veteran reserve force and so on in committee and thereafter the german armed force commissioner the inspiration behind the bill as the secretary of state highlight be entirely independent of the german defence ministry and armed force but that be not the case for the commissioner under the bill the secretary of state will appoint and be able to dismiss the secretary of state will fund the commissioner and agree their staffing arrangement be very grateful to the minister for his briefing this morning at the ministry of defence at which be able to highlight some of my initial concern and the secretary of state will be able to constrain the exercise of the commissioner power on broad ground of national security and personal safety so when minister describe the propose armed forces commissioner as independent they must surely mean something else can my hon friend the minister explain exactly what and can he tell we why he have not decide to go far in ensure the independence of the commissioner from his department can he also explain how the commissioner resource requirement have be estimate what the process would be if the commissioner ask for additional resource and who would find out and how if the commissioner be deny resource they have request the bill arrive during crisis in armed force recruitment and retention at time when there be high level of dissatisfaction with service life and an unacceptable level of inappropriate behaviour in the armed force the defence committee will be delve into that in great detail the bill can not solve those challenge on its own it would be helpful to hear from the minister exactly where the bill sit within coherent strategy and set of broad measure so that the house can consider the bill in context expectation of the new armed forces commissioner will be high they will need to be strong character with the good interest of the armed force in mind they will need to be prepare for question and challenge but also to understand win support and change heart and mind their success will likely ultimately depend on the support and trust of the armed force include the chain of command what kind of person do the government imagine fill the role how if at all will the key requirement of the role differ from those for the service complaints ombudsman appreciate that have ask lot of question of the minister but he be very capable individual and he have be take copious note no doubt he will be able to answer all my question in his speech my defence committee colleague and warmly welcome the government intention of allow the committee to conduct non bind pre appointment hearing with the secretary of state prefer candidate for the role as the secretary of state highlight that be in line with practice for the appointment of the service complaints ombudsman the defence committee have always offer both support and scrutiny to the ombudsman and we look forward to work closely with the new commissioner they will hope become regular witness before the committee hope that the government will ensure the smooth possible transition between the two role call the liberal democrat spokesperson today speak for my party in support of the legislation before we it be clear that the armed force community have be let down not least under the previous conservative government the finding of recent report and survey be testament to that in the haythornthwaite report find that the most common reason for leave the armed force be the impact on family and personal life overall satisfaction with service life be at just only just over third of personnel report that they feel value by the service the atherton report find that the mod and the services be fail to protect female personnel and to help servicewoman achieve their full potential it be unacceptable that the experience of woman in the armed force and the challenge that many female personnel face such as sexual harassment and discrimination have not be properly address armed force family be also too frequently be let down in the armed force continuous attitude survey one third of spouse say that they would be happy if their partner choose to leave the service service family be too frequently unable to get basic support such as access to information except through the member of the family who serve the complaint system be not work in her most recent annual report to parliament the service complaints ombudsman mariette hughes be scathing about it she remain unable to say that the service complaints system be efficient effective or fair that be the eighth consecutive year that she have reach that assessment woman remain disproportionately represent in the complaint system those who serve in the armed force and their family be put their life on the line for our country it be profoundly disappointing that report after report make it clear that they have be and continue to be neglect ignore and take for grant they deserve well deliver fair deal for the armed force community be not just the right thing to do it be crucial for our national security the condition that service personnel and their family endure contribute directly to the crisis in recruitment and retention that our armed force be experience in an increasingly insecure world with putin troop wag their illegal war in ukraine and trump about to return to the white house we can not afford to not take this issue seriously the liberal democrats very much welcome the bill we welcome the fact that the commissioner will be much need point of contact for armed force family will be public champion for family have be task in law with raise awareness of the welfare issue face by the armed force community and will be properly empower to independently investigate complaint for example they can arrive on site without notice we be pleased that the legislation have be introduce to parliament less than six month after the election we will support the bill and we will work with member on all side of the house to strengthen it during its passage through this house thank the service complaints ombudsman and her office for the work that they have do since offer independent insight into process and highlight the failing of the complaint system it be right for the work of the office to be subsume into this strong role but as the ombudsman make clear further work need to be do to bring the service complaint system up to standard would have like this legislation to be use to set that in motion we must ensure that the bill deliver for armed force family family be at the heart of the bill and will clearly be of significant importance to the work of the new commissioner but clause leave the definition of family member up to the secretary of state we hope that during the passage of the bill the government will commit to definition in the bill so that there be certainty for armed force family it be important that we ensure that family make up of kinship carer there be often aunt and uncle who care for niece or nephew be in scope of the definition we must also think of divorced partner who be still affect it be vital too that bereaved family come in scope of the definition and accordingly the work of the commissioner hope that member from across the house agree that bereaved family need the advocacy of the new commissioner as much as if not more than anyone else in the armed force community we also need to ensure that reservist and recruit have equal access to the commissioner as for female black and minority ethic non uk and personnel the government must ensure that the commissioner office be equip with up to date evidence and community connection to identify issue and be able to reach into those community it be to that advocacy role that now turn clause make clear that the role of the commissioner will be not just to promote the welfare of service personnel and their family but to improve the public awareness of welfare issue experience by armed force family hope that the minister will be able to shed some light on how the government envisage the interaction of those two separate function in practice the crucial issue be resource we need to ensure that both those ambition can be meet as well as the exist responsibility of the ombudsman role which be be subsume into the commissioner remit and urge the government to offer assurance on that front also hope that the minister will be able to offer further clarification of the appointment process as well as subsequent timescale for get the commissioner office up and run the government have commit to pre appointment scrutiny of the preferred candidate by the defence committee but what happen if the select committee disagree clearly whoever be appoint to this role must be truly independent of government under the previous conservative government we see the limitation of the exist public appointment process even when select committees be involve give relevant committees confirmatory vote would greatly strengthen the safeguard in the appointment process and would ensure that the good person for the job be put forward rather than the good person for the government can the minister also clarify how the commissioner will interact with the exist veterans commissioners for wales scotland and northern ireland and the propose national veteran commissioner for england the armed forces commissioner must prioritise accessibility to the community that he or she aim to represent and support we must ensure that if access be digital only that do not create barrier if for example people be deploy or have low reading age it be vital that our armed force know who they can turn to for support when they need it military personnel be train to be resilient and endure tough condition and the culture do not make it easy for people to reach out have personal experience of that if we be to introduce an armed forces commissioner the government must include an effort for culture change as well and would welcome great understanding of how they will achieve that understand that people who have serve in the armed force may be consider for this position such people could bring valuable knowledge and insight but how will the government ensure that they be sufficiently remove from the current culture to bring an independent perspective it be also vital that while welcome the creation of this new role we acknowledge that it will in no way be silver bullet to address the many problem face the armed force community which have mention and which have be touch on by other member to deal with serious complaint for instance we need to strengthen rule to help support whistleblower across government and the liberal democrats continue to support the creation of an office of the whistleblower for that purpose we urge the government to go far and fully implement the atherton report to ensure that woman in the armed force who have be let down far too frequently receive the fundamental protection that they deserve we should also look at strengthen the armed force covenant will the commissioner role include give due regard to the covenant and will the minister agree to strengthen the covenant by place legal duty on all departments to give due regard to it we will continue to present proposal to improve the quality of life for service personnel and their family there be basic step that we can and should take such as establish one stop shop for family of service personnel so they can easily gain access to information include the publication of guide and an accessible helpline housing be also hugely important service personnel and their family should be able to live in decent home pay tribute to the work of my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan who have campaign for decent home standard for military housing and hope that when the renters rights bill come back to the house for its remain stage the government will listen to liberal democrat representation on the need to enshrine that in law the armed force community deserve fair deal the liberal democrats support these measure as step in the right direction but we will continue to call on the government to do more to ensure that service personnel and their family be no long take for grant welcome the bill it be great news leave full time service only last year and it be fantastic to see the pledge that hop the government would fulfil be bring hope into law first encounter these proposal last year when we be join by eva högl the german armed force commissioner in the house for panel event only couple of week after have leave full time service and only one week after my selection as the labour parliamentary candidate for plymouth moor view it be an exciting moment but the appointment of an armed forces commissioner seem very far away it seem to be something very positive that the germans have and that we should have but to do it would require labour government and we do not know when the election would be all that have now come about we have that labour government and we be commit to deliver an armed forces commissioner and it be great that we be do so commend the conservatives and the liberal democrats for the way in which they be approach the bill and for the collegiate atmosphere know speak for many labour colleague when say that matter relate to the welfare of the armed force and veteran be over politicise in this country and approach they as one house be extremely positive hope that the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire will be encourage by the extent to which the labour party be hold up the german commissioner as model for one thing eva högl be woman and for another she have not serve in the military be sure that those point will be take into consideration when the government make their appointment as the bill make clear one of the commissioner aim will be to promote the welfare of serve personnel and their family include as have be mention bereaved family another the second of the function list in the bill be to improve the public understanding of the welfare issue face by serve personnel that be an excellent step because it will deal with something that hold back serve people particularly those who be draft into new community anyone who have be in the military will have experience this where they have no root lay down they be at the mercy of whatever their camp or base can provide it may be possible for they to obtain military housing in the area but they may be on camp beyond that they can play part in local politic and local government whether it be parish council or town council it can be very challenging for serve personnel to understand and communicate with local government and be pleased to hear member say that many council have run positive scheme involve armed force champion and their own armed force covenant in plymouth which represent along with the minister for the armed forces my hon friend the member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard we have fantastic plymouth city council armed force champion scheme if member do not know about it urge they to look at it because know from speak to resident that it have have massive effect for veteran and serve personnel one of the question that the government will face in respect of the bill be what be the relationship between the armed force commissioner and local government and as third party the tri service military yes listening be important but do be also important we need to understand how the commissioner can bring about solution and outcome for resident and obviously for serve personnel the chair of the defence committee my hon friend the member for slough mr dhesi mention reservist and know that they have be mention before when we look closely at the bill however we see that anyone who be subject to service law or military law will be entitle to access to the armed force commissioner reservist and as of last year be proud royal marines reservist be subject to military law when they be serve but not when they be not on duty that need to be clarify to maximise reservist output which know the ministry of defence be keen to do we must ensure that they feel wrap up in the system not just operationally and not just in training but in that welfare sense when will they have access to the commissioner will it just be on wednesday night when they be in their detachment or will it be throughout the week obviously the answer should be throughout the week and urge the govt to commit themselves to that finally want to commend the secretary of state who have briefly leave the chamber in the military people be often teach about have the courage of their conviction have an armed force commissioner who will report to parliament annually will not be easy for the secretary of state because the commissioner be unlikely to report solely good finding every year in fact quite the opposite he or she will probably point out the thing that we need to be do that be good because it be the sign of strong confident leadership that we be willing to appoint people who will point out flaw in the system that will be difficult and potentially expensive to solve all in all massively welcome the concept of an armed forces commissioner and the bill there be some detailed question to which we would love to know the answer and look forward to hear those in due course it be encouraging to see cross party support for the bill and it be real pleasure to be in the chamber this evening with all four former royal marines who have come into parliament in welcome the bill we all share the same goal of improve the welfare and support of those who serve in our armed force and their family the creation of an independent armed forces commissioner be positive step towards provide personnel with direct point of contact to raise concern and ensure that issue affect service life be investigate and report to parliament however it be crucial that we critically examine the bill to ensure that it effectively meet the need of our armed force community the armed force play an essential role in protect our nation and we must ensure that they be equip support and staff with the good talent have see at first hand the dedication of service personnel at the commando training centre royal marines in my constituency understand the commitment of our servicemen and woman however recruitment and retention be fall short recent datum from the ministry of defence reveal troubling trend last year the royal navy meet just of its recruitment target the army and the royal air force those significant shortfall underscore the urgent need to enhance the overall offer to our armed force to ensure that we can attract and retain the talented individual essential to safeguard our nation that be why we be take bipartisan approach to the bill we all agree that improve the welfare of our armed force be essential and we will work with the government to ensure that the bill achieve that aim recruitment be only part of the challenge retention be just as critical in the year to october personnel leave the armed force while only joined that exodus of skilled personnel put the very strength of our military at risk at the heart of the retention challenge lie the offer to our service personnel serve across tri service unit and see that offer at first hand during the last labour government and subsequent government up to although personally never find an issue and love my service as have become old have see friend who have remain in service do the normal thing that we do in life get marry start family and move to family home and witness the additional pressure that they have face have hear of the challenge with housing not be up to par know that many of we in the chamber believe that quality housing and work life balance directly impact the desire of service personnel to stay in the military we must always ensure that our personnel be properly look after and that their condition reflect the importance of the role they play until we address these issue comprehensively the retention of talented personnel will continue to be significant challenge it be no secret that since the fall of the berlin wall we have all benefit from the peace dividend derive from unipolar world which have allow we to prioritise government spending in area outside defence however we all know the international threat that we face and it be essential that our armed force be in position to do what they have do well for hundred of year defend our country and our interest abroad it be essential that we focus on the bill fine detail to ensure that it deliver real improvement important question about the scope resource and independence of the commissioner will need address in order to guarantee that this new office will provide tangible improvement for our service member and that the bill will result in strong more support armed force equip to retain the good talent to serve our nation the commissioner role must be clearly define to avoid overlap with exist military structure while the bill grant the commissioner the power to investigate welfare matter it be crucial that that role do not encroach on area of military discipline or law the commissioner should complement not replace exist military mechanism provide an additional layer of support for personnel when necessary other member have make the point this evening that establish the rank or grade of the commissioner be essential we must ensure that the commissioner hold senior position but one that respect the operational command and discipline of the armed force although the commissioner will be independent in nature they will operate in rank structured environment so it be important to establish the grade at which they will be see among high rank military official it be also crucial that the commissioner remain entirely independent of both the government and the party in power that independence must be safeguard not only in the commissioner decision making but in their ability to hold the government of the day to account without fear or favour it will be important for the labour party to set out during our scrutiny of the bill how that independence will be maintain and it will be beneficial for the house to understand what commissioner lead ministerial scrutiny look like the shadow secretary of state my hon friend the member for south suffolk james cartlidge make the point about security and classification the commissioner will be grant significant power to access ministry of defence site and document but it be vital that those power be carefully control to prevent any potential compromise of national security or operational integrity access to sensitive or operational information should be tightly restrict and permit only when necessary for investigate welfare issue the secretary of state must retain discretion to limit access where national security be concern follow strict security protocol to safeguard both personnel welfare and military operation while the commissioner can investigate welfare matter it be important that their role do not extend to interfere with military discipline or operational matter investigation relate to military conduct should remain under the purview of military law the commissioner involvement in relation to wide range welfare concern or legal matter should be well understand and we must ensure that there be clear boundary to avoid disrupt the military ability to function effectively it be nice to see that the royal british legion have lend its support to the bill fully endorse that be fully committed to ensure that the bill be successfully implement but the rbl have raise several important concern that must be address to ensure that the armed forces commissioner function effectively give the rbl extensive knowledge and expertise those concern deserve careful consideration before the bill final implementation the rbl have highlight that we must ensure that the commissioner be accessible to all service personnel another point that have be raise this evening regardless of their digital literacy or deployment circumstance rely solely on digital communication risk exclude those with limited access to technology or low digital skill and those serve in area with poor connectivity to address that we must ensure that alternative method of communication such as phone line or in person support be available the rbl have also propose an anonymous reporting mechanism similar to crimestopper to encourage personnel to raise concern with confidence and security while the potential for anonymity to increase reporting be clear it be vital to strike balance that allow the commissioner to follow up on complaint and conduct thorough investigation when necessary another point that the rbl have make be that service member may view raise concern as part of their job or feel that they should handle issue on their own for the commissioner to be effective it be important to shift how raise concern be perceive the commissioner role should help foster an environment in which report issue be recognise as positive and constructive step essential to the continuous improvement of the service and the wellbeing of personnel achieve this will require focused effort to encourage service member to seek support when need without hesitation the bill rightly extend the scope of support to service personnel and their family but it be essential that that support encompass all part of the wide armed force community include reservist recruit and veteran who each face unique challenge and should not be overlook reservist often juggle civilian career with military duty we hear from the hon member for plymouth moor view fred thomas about some of the problem with that and may encounter different support need from regular personnel similarly recruit who be at the beginning of their service journey require guidance and resource to ensure smooth transition into military life veteran have serve our country must continue to have access to appropriate support long after they leave active duty by ensure that the commissioner office cover all those group we can create truly comprehensive and inclusive support structure that meet the need of every individual who have commit to serve our nation my constituent major charles milroy who serve for long time in the reserve point out that on deployment it be often difficult for the reserve to access the support in place for serve personnel do my hon and gallant friend agree that it might help if the commissioner could look into that aspect of military life thank my hon friend for raise that concern that issue definitely need to be draw out during the later stage of the bill to ensure that everyone across the armed force community regular reservist and veteran be listen to by the commissioner think everyone in the house agree that the armed forces commissioner bill be positive step towards improve the welfare of our service personnel but as we move forward it be crucial that we carefully examine its detail to ensure that it effectively address the need of the entire armed force community from define the commissioner role to ensure broad and equitable access we must make sure that this bill deliver real tangible improvement only by get these detail right can we strengthen our armed force ensure the retention of our good talent and continue to support those who selflessly serve our country we must work together in bipartisan spirit to make this bill success and give our armed force the recognition and support they truly deserve it be great honour to speak in this debate and welcome the bipartisan tone and constructive approach take by the opposition party in their contribution it be fitting that we be debate this bill for the first time so soon after the remembrance event hold over the last few week the member of our armed force who put their life on the line for the safety and security of our country and our people give the great service it be possible to give over of the adult population of my constituency of north durham have serve in our armed force as someone from civilian background pay tribute to every one of our man and woman in uniform include the many hon and gallant members on both side of this house who have serve the bill be key part of renew the nation contract with our armed force because for too long morale and satisfaction with service life among our armed force have be fall accord to the late armed force continuous attitude survey nearly six in personnel rate their service morale as low and this figure have sadly be increase for the last few year just one in personnel rate their service morale as high and third of personnel do not feel value we know that service life impact not just those in uniform but their family too whether it relate to housing employment or the effect on their child military spouse often have negative view of the impact that service life be have on they and their family that be why it be so important that this bill will create the first ever independent champion not just for serve personnel but for their family the bill be not only about the welfare of those who serve today it be about make service life more attractive so that our rate of recruitment and retention in the armed force improve we currently have the service complaints ombudsman establish by the armed forces service complaints and financial assistance act but as the secretary of state say their remit be too narrow and reactive the ombudsman can investigate individual complaint only after the service complaint process have finish and they do not have the remit to consider broad matter impact the welfare of serve personnel replace the ombudsman with new armed forces commissioner who can launch their own investigation and make broad recommendation be therefore positive step forward indeed that have be call for by successive service complaints ombudsmen themselves new armed forces commissioner will give service personnel and their family direct contact to reach out to in order to raise issue that impact service life from equipment to accommodation and unacceptable behaviour note that the government expect the budget for the armed forces commissioner to be between million and million year the german armed force commissioner the role on which the secretary of state have say this new role be base have parliamentary staff to support they would be grateful if the minister outline how many staff he envisage the uk armed forces commissioner have the defence committee have raise question about how we can ensure that the commissioner be truly independent from the secretary of state and would welcome further clarity on that the bill fulfil the commitment in our manifesto to introduce an armed forces commissioner it acknowledge the need for change to well support serve personnel with new power to carry out investigation visit defence site unannounced and report to parliament the role outline in the bill will clearly have great impact than the exist arrangement to the benefit of service personnel and their family and ultimately therefore to the benefit of the morale and the retention rate of the armed force and the defence of the country it be another action towards fulfil the government commitment to renew the nation contract with those who serve and therefore welcome the bill it be interesting to be take part in debate that have such an outbreak of consensus indeed it be bit unsettling in this particular chamber however the scottish national party will be do nothing to rock the boat give that we welcome the role of armed forces commissioner especially their authority to investigate welfare complaint from our armed force this have be long time come the welcome superseding of the service complaints ombudsman with vital element that allow servicemen and woman recourse to function complaint system outwith the chain of command be only go to be good news and will be in step with the ambition of many right hon and hon member take this opportunity to commend the foresight of my friend and colleague the former member for west dunbartonshire martin docherty hughes who bring forward his armed forces representative body bill in if that bill have be support it would have achieve many of the same aim as this bill but five year early nevertheless key development now be the ability of the commissioner to visit defence establishment unannounced and commission report on what they find there that be central and vital improvement over the demonstrably inadequate power of the ombudsman the report will face the scrutiny of colleague in this chamber and of the defence committee which be welcome know that that scrutiny will be apply with rigour the bill should go long way towards shin light on the manifold circumstance in which many in our armed force and their family have be treat poorly by successive uk government much of that have be cause by disastrous privatisation misadventure pursue for short term gain at the expense of long term value our man and woman in uniform together with their family pay the price for that suboptimal policy in their daily life and routine we should also note that the issue face armed force personnel be already extremely well know document and understand within and outwith this chamber what the commissioner must reveal therefore be the depth and scale of these issue as have already be touch on that will necessarily make difficult reading for the ministerial team salute their ability to leave themselves open to that scrutiny key factor drive the poor experience of armed force personnel be the perpetual misallocation of funding and lack of political will to establish verifiable balance between the demand of the state on the armed force to deliver defence and security and the vote of funding allocate to the armed force by the same state to deliver against that priority everything have an upper elastic limit and if the government do not get their act together on allocate of gdp for defence greatly fear that our armed force will exceed their upper limit very soon commissioner or not from the junior rank to the chief of the defence staff they be ask for nothing other than long term clarity to allow they to deliver long term stability key performance indicator of any large organisation especially one with such an unenviable relationship with recruitment and retention be morale that be key reason why people be leave in such huge number at tremendous cost to defence in financial and operational way the solution to many of these problem be fairly straightforward but expensive they include properly maintain housing stock well mental health support well support for family when people be deploy and decent pay all of which be outwith the remit of any commissioner the bill represent welcome stride forward but it be no silver bullet to fix life in the uk armed force as we have already hear almost of personnel report low morale only third be satisfied with the welfare support that their family receive when they return from deployment and many personnel live in poor accommodation perhaps most importantly for the commissioner only of serve personnel think that leader will take meaningful action to address issue identify in the continuous attitude survey that be not great report card for this or the previous government but it be certainly starter for for the commissioner would the hon gentleman like to welcome the hour of wraparound childcare for service personnel serve overseas that the government announce this weekend which will save serve family yes what not to like be very happy to support that have two question that hope the minister will address in his sum up will the commissioner have the power to investigate the challenge face by serve personnel within the nuclear enterprise or will personnel in this service have to continue to suffer in secret scotland as usual be out in front with our veteran commissioner so what learning will the uk commissioner for serve personnel be able to take from their scottish counterpart how do the minister envisage the commissioner work together moreover give that wales and northern ireland also have veteran commissioner and that the commissioner propose by the bill will not have responsibility for veteran across the united kingdom what be the timeframe for veteran in england to enjoy the same benefit as those in scotland wales and northern ireland call alison hume to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker it be an honour to be call to make my maiden speech during this

artillery and territorial army for and half year be invest as be all member who have serve in the armed force as well as those who have not in the legislation before we be minded of the ten of thousand probably hundred of thousand of people who have serve in the armed force in northern ireland be pleased to see the minister for the armed forces in his place do not want to give he big head but whenever the minister bring something to the chamber he always ask for our opinion and contribution which mean lot to mps it be the honest way of do thing and thank he for that early on the secretary of state rightly say that this be landmark legislation think every hon member will greatly welcome it welcome the fact that the legislation will apply to northern ireland something that we in northern ireland do not take for grant when it come to the armed force and what appear to be an appeasement of those who hate those armed force in northern ireland for the record commend councillor trevor cummings the veteran champion for ards and north down borough council in my constituency of strangford on his great work and his interest in army and police issue he will welcome this legislation just as welcome it we look forward to it be implement in northern ireland to the same extent that it be implement in england be pleased that respect and access to armed force personnel support will be available unlike access to the military covenant which my party have to fight to see implement in any form for our veteran for too long veteran in northern ireland have be treat as second class citizen sham for simply do their duty hope this legislation signal new approach to veteran in northern ireland ask the minister question in defence question early and he come back with very positive answer hope he will be able to repeat his answer so that it be record in hansard and will provide reassurance to people back home would like clarity about how the commissioner will ensure that those serve in all part of the united kingdom be treat equitably in the exercise of the new commissioner function receive positive answer from the minister when ask that question early give northern ireland disproportionate contribution to reserve force we have particular interest in ensure that the commissioner provide an effective outlet for member of our armed force and their family it be important that we have that how will the commissioner remit interact with the armed force covenant which be there before there be some difficulty with that covenant but be encourage by this legislation and hope we will welcome the bill third read before too long be pleased that in the king speech there be recognition of the gratitude owe to those who have make sacrifice for our freedom and liberty today we be here to scrutinise the outworking of that gratitude in my opinion that be not extravagant or groundbreaking and proper service should always have be deliver to those whose quality of life have be impact by their service in common with many other hon member know too many veteran whose internal scar from service have preclude they from keep relationship with their family keep steady job or building friendship with people who simply can not understand what they have be through many of those proud man and woman would never apply for help or complain about the lack of support that they have receive welcome the fact that family member can now advocate to the armed forces commissioner for service for veteran that be massive step forward for veteran and their entire family unit it be good news where we have see difficulty before we can see positive go forward which be good hope that part of the role of the armed forces commissioner will be to ensure that veteran have an accessible route to support that will skip the red tape and arrive at sensible approach it be important that if service member retire or leave service while the commissioner be still process complaint it be effectively transfer to the northern ireland veterans commissioner will the minister tell we where that will fit into the process join up approach be important so seek assurance that that will happen the minister for veterans and people be not in his place but know that he will be back shortly have invite he to visit the beyond the battlefield veteran centre in portavogie in my constituency both the minister for the armed forces and the veterans minister know it well and hope that the veterans minister will visit in the near future the centre be design and build with short term respite for veteran in mind it be place for veteran and their family to come to for break with counselling service available and for change to enjoy the peaceful and restful environment of the incomparable ards peninsula where happen to live the centre be excellent and be up and run harbour house provide shelter to ex service personnel who be homeless or suffer from post traumatic stress disorder the centre do an excellent job for which we be very grateful beyond the battlefield charity that help serve and retire member of the service community transform once derelict building into dedicated veteran centre the charity provide practical help and advice on issue such as ptsd war pension benefit housing medal and funeral have be pleased privileged and honour to work alongside the charity staff to help veteran move forward and make their life well enter harbour house veteran come into welcoming reception area with tea and coffee making facility and there be bedroom suite the charity do phenomenal job there be plan to extend the facility and be sure that the veterans minister will be ask about that when he visit the previous government have hop to provide some funding do not want the charity to have to come to the government cap in hand but it want to do what it do well and to add to what it have in place those bedroom suite be full all the time but the building could be extend to increase its capacity and it would still be full in northern ireland we have commitment to service we never need conscription in northern ireland because we be always able to get volunteer when the veterans minister come we will show he the phenomenal job that beyond the battlefield be do it have coffee shop that be open to the public which help to meet people need and be well support but central funding be severely lacking it be the only veteran respite centre in northern ireland its importance can not be sufficiently underline it serve and look after veteran from the six county and probably far afield beyond the battlefield can not secure funding and rely on charitable fundraising if someone want cup of coffee or meal harbour house have be commend for its food there be scope for more room to be create and more good work to be do the installation of the armed force commissioner have be endorse and support by everybody because it be the right thing to do and will be good for everyone across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland it will provide great focus on the need of our armed force and veteran and believe that support for project such as beyond the battlefield will naturally flow from it again thank the hon member for scarborough and whitby for set the scene for this young man to make his contribution she be the star be just follower most of we in this house attend remembrance service last week we be all aware of the debt that we owe to not simply those who give their life in the world war but all those who have serve in guerrilla warfare from afghanistan to armagh and from erbil to enniskillen the debt be not pay in one day with the recitation of poem do not mean that disrespectfully but through living and breathing hope that the creation of this post will breathe fresh air into the obligation that we have to those who offer we their all be convinced that it will congratulate my hon friend the member for scarborough and whitby alison hume on her excellent and evocative speech remember those sweeping coastline and purple top moor use to fly over they in my raf she will be an excellent advocate for her community and all those who come up behind she in the jo cox foundation our force can defend our country effectively only if the bond of trust between service people and leader be strong welcome the government action on our manifesto commitment to establish an armed force commissioner and fix the complaint system which have be break for many year action be urgently need confidence in the service complaint system remain low despite the work that the service complaints ombudsman have do the ombudsman herself have conclude every year for the last eight year that the system do not operate in an efficient effective or fair way in what other area of public life would such sustained failure be allow to persist fundamental issue need to be address that go beyond performance standard on individual complaint the big problem with the current system be that it individualise complaint and encourage mediation in each instance in my experience that can result in abusive or incompetent individual remain in place and perpetuate harm over many year even though they have have many complaint against they surely we can learn the lesson from the letby case police disciplinary case and similar case of very public systemic failure over recent year the commissioner need to be empower to seek out the big picture and the pattern behind individual complaint and escalate they proportionately as we know often small number of individual wreak enormous damage on not only their many victim but the organisation as whole because of the hostile and discriminatory environment that they create only system that proactively identify pattern of behaviour and root out abuser will deliver safe and fairer place for everyone in our force community the commissioner work need to form normal part of service life service people rarely want to be see as whistleblower rightly or wrongly many do not want to go outside the system due to perception of let the force down so we need to be clear that when someone communicate with the commissioner about their experience they be stay within the armed force community and act in the good interest of all our armed force at the same time we need people to have confidence that their communication will be secure and that they will be protect from any possibility of reprisal hope that the minister will tell we more about how the government see such communication with the commissioner compare with whistleblowing in civilian life it might be necessary to set out in the bill the protection that be relevant to service complaint to clarify that improve the complaint system will be effective only if we address the experience of every part of our armed force community include woman in our armed service service personnel from ethnic minority background non uk passport holder and service personnel there be troubling evidence of differential treatment for service personnel from those background it be vital that we address that in the interest of fairness to ensure that our force be more representative of the community they serve and to address ongoing issue of recruitment and retention the bill present an opportunity to effect change so would be grateful for anything that the minister could set out about how he expect the commissioner to establish connection with those community and work with they proactively to gain an understanding of what be require equally the commissioner need to represent the wide armed force community beyond regular service personnel service family be clearly critical to many of the commissioner function but hope that it be make completely clear that the bereaved be equally deserving of our continued support if they wish for it the royal british legion have rightly point out the relevance of the haythornthwaite review and its central recommendation that there be move towards fluid spectrum of service where people can move easily between regular and the reserve work towards that will surely require action from the commissioner to ensure that the need of reservist and recruit be be meet welcome the government ongoing work to meet our manifesto commitment to put the armed force covenant into law be mindful of the cross departmental nature of many of the issue that affect service personnel something that be rightly make explicit in the covenant wonder whether as the bill progress we should consider set out the relationship between the commissioner and the cabinet office to give clear point of contact within government and way to easily escalate complaint that be impact by cross government work surely it would be good to future proof the bill by ensure that the commissioner structure fit with the covenant from the outset although accept that the department think about the good legal form for the armed force covenant may not yet be complete will the minister set out any early thought on that ultimately the bill represent very welcome action from the government to give the people who keep we safe more effective guarantee of safety and fair and decent treatment in return it be equally welcome that we be learn from our european partner about the design of the institution and place emphasis on transparency and accountability to parliament my hope be that the bill will form part of wide shift in how the armed force community work to deliver on the promise of defence as truly rewarding career of service if we can achieve that our country will be safe for it declare an interest and huge sense of pride in take part in this debate have cousin who serve in the army and the royal air force and son in the royal navy all of whom be under hopefully because of the bill they be at the start of long and successful armed force career also my constituency of portsmouth north be the home of the royal navy be glad that the minister for the armed forces my hon friend the member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard be not here to argue about that think he be mean the other one my hon friend the member for plymouth moor view fred thomas be proud to be part of mission lead government but as the secretary of state say early no mission from labour government be complete unless it be our first duty to keep our country safe peace and security be hard earn and require constant vigilance and well staff and dare aspire to say happy armed force workforce this bill be groundbreake in its mission with service personnel and their family at its heart it provide the opportunity and the authority for an independent commissioner to investigate welfare complaint not only from those serve but from their family it also give the commissioner the opportunity and the authority to horizon scan to highlight trend to visit our basis and listen to personnel and their family to launch investigation when need and ultimately to improve the world of work and the life of those who so often put this country first welcome the stance of the whole house and the cross party commitment to this bill real change can not come quickly enough attrition rate continue to grow and morale among our service personnel continue to plummet at the moment recruitment be outstrip by those leave so retention be real concern despite of our service personnel feeling support by their family and their colleague it be upsetting that almost do not feel that their family and their family life be support by the service impact on family and personal life remain the top factor influence those leave the service it would be remiss of not to note that in my portsmouth north constituency the concern around armed force housing be very high with three quarter of our personnel live in service accommodation it be vital to be able to hear the voice of those serve and their family and to use that to improve housing community childcare and the life of our force and their family this government be serious about keep our country safe and make our armed service priority with pay rise already award with an announcement on childcare provision already make with new cyber route and the cutting of red tape in recruitment and now with bill provide an armed force champion with real voice and real experience at its centre this be step to build back that erode trust and pride just as do when my son return from sea we as government be put our arm around service personnel and their family this will not be easy and it will not be quick issue will be uncover that will be uncomfortable and possibly costly culture might need to change the secretary of state will be present with report and independent investigation and parliament will need to address these issue success or failure will be measure and voice as it should be will the minister assure that however difficult the outcome the report and the word that we hear from our service personnel we will commit to have truly independent commissioner so that our armed service feel they have the trust to go to they in deliver this bill into law we will not only say but show by our action how much we value the service and dedication of our armed force personnel and their family my constituency be the proud home to the air assault brigade combat team and the garrison and wide community be home to many serve personnel and their family we know that the man and woman in our armed service serve our nation proudly and put their life at risk to defend the freedom we all hold dear pay personal tribute to my father in law my nephew and other member of my extended family who have serve and serve today be proud to stand on manifesto that commit to establish an independent armed forces commissioner to improve service life for our force and the family who support they and here pay tribute to my mother in law for all that she do on that score this bill deliver on that promise the last government hollow out and underfunde our armed force but the extra billion announce in the budget put we back on the path of investment in our defence and our defence workforce be very pleased that the armed forces commissioner will be direct point of contact for serve personnel and their family the commissioner will be able to raise issue that impact service life include access to good quality housing and childcare know that while army family in colchester provide so much support for each other they often do not feel that they get the support they deserve and that need to change the last labour government introduce the armed force covenant and welcome this government commitment to incorporate that covenant fully into law in colchester we be support by many great organisation such as the army benevolent fund ssafa and regimental charity such as support our paras thank they for the work they do and would like to see the new commissioner work hard and closely with they be also pleased that this bill support other wide change that the government be already make to support our veteran point make early by opposition members we have already deliver on our manifesto commitment to make the veteran id card an accepted form of voter id we have act to improve veteran access to secure healthy home and we have invest million of additional funding for veteran homelessness support programme this government be absolutely committed to the welfare of veteran be delighted that this labour government be introduce the armed forces commissioner post have write about commissioner role elsewhere and compare their power hope that this role will be as strong as the strong of the rest if so that commissioner will be strong independent voice for our force in colchester and across the country commit to improve service life support this bill wholeheartedly echo other hon member who have say how nice it be to hear from so many serviceman and woman in this house and so many hon member who represent service community who be collectively behind this bill just over week ago we observe remembrance sunday solemn day to honour the courage dedication and sacrifice of our armed force that annual act of remembrance be poignant reminder of the immense debt of gratitude we owe those who serve it be therefore fitting that the government have in the same month introduce the armed forces commissioner bill which rightly recognise that improve the life of service personnel and their family be not only moral duty but necessity if we be to recruit and retain the people we need over the past decade our armed force have face significant challenge compound by underfunding and series of cut research have lay bare the reality optimism among the armed force have reach record low and recruitment and retention be in state of crisis annual survey of service personnel consistently reveal high level of dissatisfaction with service life nearly report low morale and less than half express satisfaction with their service experience those figure speak volume about the press need for reform and meaningful change know how bad it have become because come from service family grow up live on an raf base and follow my dad and brother into the armed force in recent year we have all see the deterioration in the experience of service life with the state of accommodation in particular be huge problem for example my brother after year service in the royal air force be expect to live in accommodation that have rise damp and sewage leak into part of the premise his family with young daughter be expect to live in house with black mould and broken plumbing that be unacceptable we would not expect prisoner to live like that and we should not expect our brave servicemen and woman and their family to live in such condition have speak to many people in my constituency and elsewhere who have similar story poor housing and lack of action from those who have responsibility that be why it be so important to have an armed forces commissioner to advocate on behalf of service personnel such as my brother when their voice go unheard this commissioner will provide powerful and independent voice for service personnel and the family who support they they will report directly to parliament ensure accountability and transparency in address the need and concern of those who serve and the framework will give service personnel confidence that their voice be hear their issue be take seriously and they have robust advocate work on their behalf every year we stand together as nation to pay tribute to those who have give their life in service to our country but that tribute must go beyond word and ceremony it must be match by concrete action by the politician entrust with represent their interest as veteran understand how deeply service shape not only those who serve but their family be proud to stand here today both as an mp and as former royal marine to lend my full support this bill at second reading this legislation be step in the right direction and step towards ensure that every member of our armed force know that their sacrifice be value and that they be support by system design to protect their interest and those of their family for too long those need have go unmet this bill be an opportunity to change that may too begin by welcome contribution from across the house it have be remarkably cross party consensual debate so far and be sure that will continue unlike some who have speak my family do not have veteran but grow up for three and half year on an raf base in berlin it be subject to something call the berlin budget which ensure that adequate housing be not problem thank to taxpayer in berlin it be interesting that this provision be model on an exist german position that be always something would welcome and country that have great feeling for it be pleasure to speak in this debate as this labour government continue at pace to put in place more of the many commitment make to my constituent and other in our manifesto the government have already take action to stabilise our economy unleash investment and reform the house of lords for scotland the recent budget see record billion of additional funding pay rise for scot and many other benefit in defence as other have mention the government have increase pay for our armed force deliver an extra billion for the defence budget on top of billion annually for ukraine for as long as it will take to defeat vladimir putin the bill will help to protect those serve in our armed force and their family in the dunfermline and dollar region and the wide part of fife we have proud heritage of military family both serve and in veteran community from the royal navy and rosyth dockyard in my constituency to the former raf base at leuchars now use by the army the exist raf base at lossiemouth the nuclear deterrent on the clyde and training ground for commando and special force unit throughout the highland dunfermline fife and scotland know lot about what be need to support soldier and their family which be why welcome the bill force family face long period apart frequent move educational change housing issue those have already be mention inconsistent access to healthcare and sometimes even different tax arrangement within the uk the nature of the military with the vital and necessary chain of command can lead and in the past have lead to closed shop and the development of toxic and unhelpful practice and culture while some issue must continue to be deal with by the chain of command because the role of serve personnel often mean that their family must follow they around there must also be route that allow they to raise broad issue of concern something that the bill will achieve with the armed forces commissioner as other have mention we must ensure that living condition be appropriate for our armed force personnel both with their family and when apart it be unacceptable to expect our armed force to live in inadequate housing not just from health perspective but because that be not conducive to modern family life speak recently to veteran in my community and they say that sometimes they would just welcome access to adequate wi fi so that they can keep in touch with their family when abroad on related matter strongly welcome the announcement by the prime minister and the government action with the home for hero commitment and thank my right hon friend the defence secretary and his ministerial team for the rigour that know they be apply to its implementation wish we could see more action particularly from the snp in scotland where would like to see much more committed approach to service for our armed force and veteran if we do not begin to address some of these issue quickly and directly and with the highly competitive career market that we face it will only become hard to recruit and retain armed force personnel in an ever more unstable world we must ensure that uk armed force be an attractive employer not only for those on the frontline but for the thousand of essential staff who might otherwise choose to work in the private sector in area such as logistic or technology we must ensure that bullying harassment and discrimination be drive from our armed force at all level not only be that the right thing to do and how we make the armed force an attractive and responsible employer and not only be it how we build and maintain morale and recruit and retain staff but it be also how we ensure that our armed force be able and ready to fight when we need they to the independent role that the bill seek to establish offer the possibility to create an effective and independent process that will provide people with confidence that they can raise concern and see an established and transparent process for how those concern will be investigate and address quickly and effectively do not welcome the future position of ministers who must respond to some of these report as believe they will lay bare some of the challenge that have be allow to build up over year and decade but face they we will and face they we must when the minister respond will he explain how the commissioner be intend to work with the devolved administrations and local authority inside those administration where we have another layer of government we must ensure that it do not fail local authority be of course think particularly of scotland it have take long time for parliament and government to recognise and address the different life live by our armed force and their family it should be no surprise that it have once again take labour government to take the necessary action to protect our armed force last week commend the secretary of state introduction of this bill as promise make and promise fulfil it deliver on the government manifesto commitment to strengthen support for our armed force community as scottish labour member of parliament be proud to speak in support of it today the bill represent this new government determination to renew the contract between the nation and those who serve and protect our country know this government will always stand up for our armed force that be why they have already confirm the large pay rise for personnel in year at its core the bill be about ensure that our brave man and woman in uniform be properly support and protect and that they be treat with the dignity and respect that they deserve throughout their career our armed force be an essential part of the fabric of our national life both in scotland and across the uk as whole that be bring to life in my livingston constituency which be home to the military museum scotland at wilkieston that fantastic award win museum cover scottish military history from world war one to the present day west lothian be also home to the ancre somme association scotland wonderful charity with councillor harry cartmill who represent bathgate as its chairman and found member asa prioritise the education of local armed force history work with school community veteran family and serve personnel to show the importance of our armed force in our community from scottish regiment that have serve with distinction on battlefield across the world to present day personnel base in the livingston constituency and town and city across scotland our servicemen and woman stand ready and willing to defend our way of life they not only serve our country but embody the value that we hold dear duty loyalty sacrifice and service too often however we hear of the struggle face by service member such as difficulty in access mental health service or issue with accommodation or childcare the creation of an armed forces commissioner represent significant step forward in address those challenge as strong independent champion for serve personnel and their family the commissioner will be direct point of contact for people to raise issue that impact service life not only will the commissioner be voice for the concern of serve family but they will also hold the government any government include this one accountable as many member have say it show real leadership that we be willing to put that on the line to ensure that every year we have to respond to those challenge the bill have the support of service personnel the royal british legion and poppyscotland feedback from germany on the establishment and functioning of similar role indicate strong support from service personnel for an independent commissioner this labour government be champion of our armed force as all labour governments before they have be government first duty be to national service and the defence of our country and that include duty of care to those who take up that burden in conclusion the new armed forces commissioner must have the power need to investigate complaint scrutinise the government action and ultimately provide meaningful recommendation for action the bill be commitment to ensure that the welfare of our armed force personnel be not an afterthought but an ongoing priority day in day out it be recognition of the need for long term vision for well future for our force believe the establishment of the commissioner will help we to build military that be not only strong in its purpose but strong in its support for those individual who serve in it may start by say how humbling it be to share these benches with those who have serve our country you add far more to this debate than could ever hope to and it be genuine honour to have hear so many of you speak today our armed force be too small in the current geopolitical climate that fact be undeniable in this era of unprecedented global uncertainty we must ask ourselves fundamental question be our defence capability sufficient to protect our nation uphold our value and fulfil our obligation to ally russia brutal aggression in ukraine have make one thing clear conventional warfare be not relic of the past but clear and present danger regardless of the decision make by our close ally the united states in the come month the uk must urgently stand ready to act with our ally we must assert our position as key strategic player in global security to achieve that we need solid foundation for the expansion of our military capability and that begin with address the challenge of recruitment and retention since we have miss our recruitment target in every year but one this bill be critical to solve that crisis and arrest the decline fundamentally it seek to strengthen advocacy and accountability by establish an independent figure dedicate to address issue face by service member include housing healthcare mental health and family support the commissioner will have new power to proactively investigate systemic problem rather than simply react to scandal as they emerge such as the housing issue we have hear so much about today by hold decision maker accountable the commissioner will drive improvement that make military life more attractive to current personnel and potential recruit make no mistake the passing of this bill and the creation of this role will and should make the life of decision maker more difficult as they be rightly challenge at every turn to do well by our armed force that proactive approach will enhance trust and transparency create real sense that service member concern be hear and act upon the armed forces commissioner will provide direct point of contact for personnel and their family ensure that their voice shape the future of military life the bill be part of broad effort by the government to honour the man and woman of our armed force so welcome the wraparound childcare for military family deploy overseas which recognise the sacrifice that service family make welcome that after year of real term pay cut we have see the big pay rise in year deliver by this labour government that be critical and much need break from the recent past welcome the armed force covenant be fully enshrine into law ensure that those who serve and their family be treat with fairness and respect speak to countless hartlepool veteran who have tell that far too many public service whether gp practice dentist housing provider or other pay only lip service to that covenant that must change finally commend the prime minister commitment to home for hero an initiative to end the disgrace of veteran homelessness veteran must be at the front of the queue if we be to honour their service to our country in an uncertain world we must expand our armed force but we can succeed only by renew our country contract with those who serve or who have serve support they and their family an independent advocate for service personnel real term pay rise and tangible support for veteran be not just policy but the patriotic foundation of strong more secure future as the mp for sandhurst be proud to represent the home of royal military academy sandhurst where every british army officer start their journey of service it be important to reflect that in recent year that service have not necessarily be repay by we be alarmed that only four in service personnel be satisfied with service life and the fact that the armed force be shrink due to recruitment and retention crisis should worry we all with that in mind warmly welcome the establishment of the armed forces commissioner as part of the government overall plan to renew the nation contract with those who serve we it be vital that the armed forces commissioner should be independent note with interest the contribution make by my hon friend the member for slough mr dhesi the chair of the defence committee on that point also note the view of my hon friend the member for plymouth moor view fred thomas that the overwhelming proof of that independence will be whether the commissioner be in position to shine light on welfare matter to address issue of culture and to raise the quality of service life the proof as they say will be in the pudding on that note it be welcome that the commissioner will be able to bring their report to parliament for we to scrutinise it be also vital that the role should be powerful voice for service family those who serve be too often constrain by the lack of support for those who support they in their important role also welcome the proactive investigatory power of the armed forces commissioner the bill be welcome but it be important to note that it be only part of wide commitment to support our armed force which include decent pay rise with more pay for recruit million more to support veteran face homelessness and the expansion of the veteran card as an approve form of voter id it will be digitise too this weekend hour of wraparound childcare for service personnel serve overseas be announce which will save family that be important because too often serve member of our armed force find that their family at home be not give the support while they serve our country overseas that have to change in modern world where in the armed force as in the rest of society two member of household will often be work it be important for we to give that support for family care include to single parent who be serve finally take this opportunity to reflect on the grim anniversary that we face tomorrow day since putin illegal invasion of ukraine this be an important moment to reflect on the sacrifice and service we ask of our armed force as we look to the brave service of ukrainian soldier face up to the aggression of putin illegal war the world be more dangerous place we ask great deal of those who serve for we and they do so know that they may be ask to make the ultimate sacrifice with that in mind it be vital that we renew our contract with those who serve we so that we serve they the bill be an important step in get that right welcome the introduction of the armed forces commissioner bill and the cross party support for it the government could not have introduce the bill at more prudent time as our service personnel have make it clear over many year that they be not get the quality of support that they need whether because of poor response to concern and complaint the quality of home or the treatment of woman and other minority group the ministry of defence most recent attitude report show that morale amongst service personnel fall for the third year in row only around third of military personnel report feel value by their service despite the vital defence role they play pay satisfaction which last year be at its low record level have increase by only it be time that those concern be address we know that the government have already announce the large armed force pay increase in year and the introduction of the armed force commissioner represent even further investment in the welfare of our force this vital support be not only incredibly well deserved but long overdue ten unit be station at chetwynd barrack in my constituency of broxtowe and the establishment of an armed force commissioner will transform how the concern and need of our armed force personnel and their loved one be address in an ever change defence landscape it be key that the government ensure that our armed force have dedicated spokesperson and advocate to ensure that their voice be hear at the high level it be time that we create an infrastructure to establish that long need sense of security and support within the military community let we move forward with this important legislation and reinforce our commitment to the welfare of our service member in do so let we ensure that those who serve and their family be give the support that they so rightly deserve let we establish an armed force commissioner so that we can well serve those who nobly serve our country with armistice day just one week behind we and with respect and admiration for veteran service personnel and their family still fresh in the public consciousness it be only fitting that we speak about bill that will improve the quality of life in service and ensure that our military personnel receive the respect and support that they deserve it be widely know that our armed force face record level of low morale and crisis in recruitment and retention with only four in service member satisfied with life in service and who can blame they in service family accommodation home be leave without heat for over five day during the christmas period and only of personnel be satisfied with maintenance response while most service family accommodation be officially rat as decent independent review highlight serious issue with many family endure poor repair our armed force deserve well address those issue be not luxury but necessity it be simply unacceptable that in nearly of female service personnel and veteran report experience of bullying harassment discrimination and in rare case even bad those number speak for themselves and our structure be not work what measure will the government use to evaluate the success of the armed force commissioner in address welfare issue and how will they ensure that personnel see tangible improvement in their day to day live as result will the commissioner have role in oversee the support provide to those who have serve during their transition to civilian life to ensure that their welfare be not neglect our service personnel and their family continue to sacrifice in the name of our freedom so it be only right that we provide they with the support and respect that they deserve the weekend before last attend memorial service in my constituency of dudley be proud to see how many people turn out to pay their respect and thank the servicemen and woman past and present who have give so much to our country in particular thank the people of the lower gornal royal british legion and the many dedicated veteran and volunteer who dutifully maintain our heritage include those of all saints church in sedgley as the people of dudley pay their respect to our veteran and service personnel of the past it be only right that we ensure that the right quality of service be give to the armed force of the present the bill by create the role of armed force commissioner provide we with crucial opportunity to address those deep seat issue it be not just about improve condition it be also about fundamentally change the culture within our armed force our servicemen and woman deserve nothing less than our respect support and gratitude for all the support they have give we and the service they provide be pleased to speak in support of these proposal for number of reason but particularly because come from family who have public service include military service in our blood number of my family have serve in the armed force of particular note be my uncle clifford berry who serve for more than year in the royal engineers that role see he complete two tour in northern ireland as well as post overseas in germany and service in the falkland islands support for our armed service be root in the dna of my constituency too in the north of south west norfolk we be proud to host raf marham home to the lightning squadron and service personnel and their family at the other end just outside the constituency boundary be raf honington in suffolk home to the raf regiment and the specialist counter chemical nuclear and biological weapon team although admit that that base be physically locate in suffolk it be in my hometown of thetford that many of its personnel and their family be base recently be proud to grant they the freedom of the town nearby we also have raf mildenhall and raf lakenheath which work alongside our friend and ally from the united states in the light of that interconnect patchwork of military personnel it be little wonder that people in my constituency be so passionate and supportive of our armed service during the lead up to remembrance day be proud to support local volunteer from the royal british legion in collect fund as part of the poppy appeal as well as the important task of raise money be pleased to speak to so many people about why they want to support the rbl and about their personal connection to our armed force it be truly honourable and enjoyable few hour and my thank go to heather local rbl volunteer for host in my role as local councillor however have see different side to thing have have to issue food bank voucher to family of service personnel as they have struggle to make end meet and fellow councillor have repeatedly have to complain about the state of military housing and raise issue about mould and damp which have impact on family health as my hon friend the member for halesowen alex ballinger highlight military housing be all too often age poorly insulate and not energy efficient and as result many family spend disproportionate sum of money on heat their home in some part of norfolk they be pay day for their electricity because of poor insulation and they be often give electric heater which offer no solution many of those home provide miserable existence in winter month with draught cold floor damp and mould it have occur to in recent month that our share respect and support for our armed service be not adequately reflect in the system design to support they hope that the new commissioner will change that as number of member have remark the first duty of any government be to keep our country safe at the heart of our security be the man and woman who serve and risk their life in defence of our nation it be also worth mention how the erosion of our public service more generally over the past year have be impact on service personnel and their family in my downham market constituency surgery serve member of the military recently tell about his son who have additional need as family they be unable to find suitable education and so be force to home school their son dad be force to work from home and he be no long deployable which take very skilled operative out of the service and mean an unwelcome pay cut for the family be proud that the labour government recognise the sacrifice make not only by those in uniform but by their family the new commissioner as direct point of contact for serve personnel and importantly for their family will be able to raise the full breadth of issue that impact on service life the power to proactively investigate be important as be the ability to access information and visit site because believe seeing be believe when it come to some of these issue my hon friend the member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey capture this point brilliantly early so often there be culture of not want to speak out of not want to rock the boat hear so many time that military family do not want to create fuss the independent aspect of this role be so important and would be grateful if the minister clarify far the independence of the commissioner be sure that would be of great interest to my constituent safeguard whistleblowing be important the bill be big step forward and be very happy to support it on behalf of the resident of south west norfolk establish an armed forces commissioner will make real difference to the military family represent in the home of the british army so be delighted to have the opportunity to speak in this debate and welcome this important legislation we have hear from across of the house about the tremendous debt we owe our armed force we feel that very deeply in aldershot and farnborough as people from our community have serve in every major conflict that our country have face over the past year the bill be essentially about respect show respect to those serve and for the family who support they this be about not just word but deed the armed force covenant be there to ensure that those who serve and their family be not disadvantage by be part of our military community but have hear time and again in countless conversation on doorstep across my constituency how force family be often automatically on the back foot when they move on to military estate in my community spouse share with last week how her three child have be allocate to three different primary school within seven mile radius how be she suppose to get all her child to school on time that be an all too common experience for family in my constituency other have tell how they have try to use their voice to speak up about shoddy accommodation that simply be not up to standard but too many have be wear down and fatigue by the process give up hope that anything will ever change take this opportunity to pay tribute to councillor nadia martin the armed force champion for rushmoor borough council nadia be military spouse who have singlehandedly give voice to so many serve family and veteran in our community we have become lot well at support our armed force and veteran because of nadia work and our community owe she huge amount of thank however for every case we know and hear about many other go unspoken and unresolved because people be too scared to speak out for fear that it might harm their career or that of their partner that be why we need an independent armed forces commissioner someone our force can trust and who can investigate follow up hold government to account and be the guide star for this place as we renew our nation contract with those who serve our country after generation of our armed force be neglect and run down by the conservative government leave morale at record low we desperately need to give hope to our serve personnel my constituent do not want the earth they just want the basic equipment that they need to be able to do their job good life for their family and positive future when their time serve come to an end hope that the bill will move we close to that because if they be willing to fight for we it be the very least that we can do call the shadow minister as the shadow armed forces minister begin by reiterate that conservative members approach this bill as critical friend with commitment to strengthen its impact for those who serve this country so bravely this have be good quality debate conduct in notably bipartisan spirit another sub theme have be the benign presence of former royal marine mafia they have be prevalent throughout the debate from the veterans minister himself downwards for the record the veterans minister be present for the opening speech even though he be not allow to contribute we have have number of extremely good back bench speech from the hon member for plymouth moor view fred thomas for north durham luke akehurst for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan for strangford jim shannon for leyton and wanstead mr bailey for portsmouth north amanda martin for colchester pam cox for halesowen alex ballinger for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie for livingston gregor poynton for hartlepool mr brash for bracknell peter swallow for broxtowe juliet campbell for dudley sonia kumar for south west norfolk terry jermy and last but not least for aldershot alex baker as well as from my hon friend the member for exmouth and exeter east david reed be particularly indebted to the hon member for bracknell who mention that he have the royal military academy sandhurst in his constituency in tonight debate number of tribute be pay by hon member who have relative who serve in the armed force it be greatly to the house credit that we now have so many mp who have either serve in the armed force or have love one who do my godson second lieutenant alexander blackwell pass out from the sovereign parade at rma sandhurst in august and be now second lieutenant commission into the regular army place on the record that be as proud of he as all other hon member be of their family member we also have very accomplished maiden speech from the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume not only be she lucid and entertaining but it be the first occasion in my year in this place on which have know anyone to get dracula into maiden speech she really get her tooth into it more seriously she invoke the memory of our fall comrade jo cox and quite rightly point to her plaque which be on the wall behind of course jo be famous for her suggestion that as members of parliament we have more in common than divide we that be absolutely the spirit of this evening very good debate at the core of this bill as be sure the minister will agree lie commitment to support our armed force personnel they deserve system that not only honour their service but ensure accountability and fairness in address their legitimate concern the bill propose model similar to the german system whereby the commissioner have what we might characterise as ofsted like power include the ability to enter military site and access pertinent information for investigation if execute correctly this could enhance oversight transparency and the live experience of our servicemen and woman strengthen public confidence in how their issue be address truly independent well resource commissioner with the right power could be powerful voice for our service personnel and veteran will come back to the topic of veteran address their concern fairly transparently and promptly we believe that this vision deserve cross party support however there be detail in the bill that we intend to examine closely we must ensure that it truly deliver on its promise without add unnecessary complexity to the exist oversight system as we support the vision of the bill we also have duty to scrutinise how this new role will be implement how it will integrate into the current framework and its implication for those already navigate the armed force complaint system in short the challenge for ministers will be to convince armed force personnel and their family that this new legislation will represent real change and will not just mean replace the nameplate outside the office of the service complaints ombudsman with new one that say armed forces commissioner we support the vision but the proof of the pudding really will be in the eating have question that hope the minister will address in his wind up speech first his majesty loyal opposition have concern regard the transition of case outstanding with the service complaints ombudsman whose office will be abolish via clause some of those case have be open for considerable time cause significant stress and frustration to those affect will the minister explain what will happen to the many case still outstanding with the current ombudsman will they be transfer automatically to the new commissioner if so what assurance can he give that the transition which will follow royal assent will not lead to further delay or the loss of critical information our service personnel deserve timely resolution indeed we must avoid any risk of case slip through the crack during the handover hope he will accept that that be perfectly legitimate concern secondly what be the timeline for establish the new commissioner role do the government expect to have the commissioner in place by the time the strategic defence review report in the first half of next year some cynic be already suggest that that will be in late june if we could have confirmation on the timeline that would be helpful thirdly come to financial question what will be the true cost of establish and maintain the commissioner paragraph of propose new schedule to the armed forces act state the secretary of state may make payment and provide other financial assistance to the commissioner what budget have be allocate to the commissioner office for will that come from the mod budget or from the cabinet office wherever it come from how much money be we talk about the figure of million have be mention couple of time this evening wonder whether the minister can confirm that on the financial implication how will that funding affect other essential service as hon member in all part of the house know defence budget be continually stretch fourthly another critical area on which we would like further clarity be the authority that the commissioner will hold will this individual have the autonomy need to genuinely advocate for our force without interference that point be stress by the chair of the defence committee the hon member for slough mr dhesi in his very good contribution how will the commissioner interact with the defence committee the secretary of state confirm in his opening remark that the defence committee will be involve in the appointment process will it have veto on propose appointee if for whatever reason it have concern that they might not be suitable it be crucial that the bill bring about measurable change that be beneficial to our service personnel the proposal in the bill that thematic report be lay before parliament each year be welcome by the opposition finally as number of hon member have ask what about veteran clause will amend the armed forces act to allow the commissioner to investigate general service welfare matter which in the commissioner opinion arise in connection with the ongoing service of person subject to service law or relevant family member there be no direct reference to veteran even though by definition they previously serve in the armed force some of they for many year give that veteran also experience welfare issue not least to do with the payment of pension or outstanding claim from the armed force compensation scheme be there scope for allow the new commissioner to take responsibility for examine those issue too the royal british legion state in its very good briefing note on the bill rbl and poppyscotland would like clarity on how the armed forces commissioner will interact with the exist veterans commissioners for wales scotland and northern ireland and the propose national veterans commissioner when the minister sum up will he explain what the relationship will be between the new armed force commissioner and the propose national veterans commissioner while he be at it will he update we on the progress on the national veterans commissioner on related point the well respect northern ireland veteran commissioner danny kinahan resign recently for reason that have not be make entirely clear will the minister update the house on why he resign and what arrangement have be put in place for his replacement as have outline the armed forces commissioner bill represent an opportunity to enhance the support and advocacy that we provide to our armed force there be potential for the bill to address some of the most pressing issue face service personnel today and to offer essential accountability and transparency to those who sacrifice so much in the service of our nation it be crucial that we get this right we be commit to work with the government to ensure that the bill deliver on its promise we owe it to our armed force to scrutinise the detail thoroughly so that this legislation do not become another layer of oversight that complicate the process but rather provide streamlined and meaningful support by address the issue we have raise today the transition of outstanding ombudsman case the urgency of the timeline the potential cost the commissioner authority and the scope of support for veteran we can avoid pitfall as we move forward and the bill enter committee we will continue to work constructively with the government in hope the same bipartisan spirit that the whole house have clearly embody this evening push for clarity and advocate for the change need to make this legislation as truly impactful as be sure that the government and the minister intend it to be our force deserve nothing less we stand ready to collaborate on secure fair accountable and effective system that uphold the high standard for those who be serve and who have serve and their family we thank they for their service thank all member who have speak in this debate number of member speak about the importance of this time of year last week be on the falkland islands to

grateful if member could continue this debate because the bill be important it be important that we get this right it be important that we set the parameter for the armed forces commissioner the power and the role they will have and in particular stress the impartiality and independence of the role that be absolutely key be strike by just how many member begin their speech with an assessment of where we be now my hon friend the member for aldershot describe personnel as feel wear down the hon member for exmouth and exeter east describe the significant shortfall in recruitment and an exodus of skill and personnel in recent year and he be correct to do so number of member relate that to the evidence the mod collect in the continuous attitude survey the fall morale in the attitude of our armed force personnel really stand as roll call of shame for the previous government it be not the fault of armed force personnel but collective failure to address the issue that underpin service life that be one of the reason why this government propose an armed forces commissioner and why we must get it right to provide direct contact for our armed force personnel and their family number of member speak about the culture in our armed force the vast majority of people who serve our country do so with the right value and the right attitude but there be far too many example where that be not the case be grateful to the hon member for epsom and ewell for raise the atherton review the report by sarah atherton in the previous parliament should be compulsory reading for all member of parliament say to new member who have join we since the general election that it be well worth google to understand the experience of so many woman in our armed force it be worth have on your bedside

life for so many other people he be correct to do so my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar likewise speak about the importance of lift our culture the role of the armed forces commissioner have be specifically design so that they can investigate issue relate to general service welfare matter for those who serve and their family it be not for as minister or for the secretary of state or anyone else on the government bench to set out what the armed forces commissioner should investigate it be for we to give that person the power and the ability to get to the heart of the problem be grateful to all member who very kindly give the front bench word of advice my hon friend the member for plymouth moor view say it will not be easy read the commissioner report as do my hon friend the member for livingston the hon member for angus and perthshire glens describe the government as leave themselves open to scrutiny my hon friend the member for bracknell speak about the proof be in the pudding they be all right to do so we be deliberately open ourselves to scrutiny because it will improve the life of those people who serve and their family it be strength of this government that we feel open to want additional scrutiny and be grateful to members who encourage it far encourage member to look at how these power can be strengthen and scrutinise over the course of the bill passage number of member speak about the bill application to veteran be grateful to all who speak about the important contribution of those people who have serve our armed force and serve our nation in year past the bill be deliberately draw to focus relentlessly on armed force personnel serve today and their family that be not because we wish to discard the experience of veteran far from it it be because we believe look at the continuous attitude survey the fall morale and more people leave our armed force than join there be problem that need to be address for those people who serve our nation the power of the armed forces commissioner be deliberately draw to focus on those people who serve it be explicit in the bill that we be deal with people who serve in uniform today and their family and we make no apology for do so however number of issue have be raise in the debate and shall be grateful if those who have raise they continue to take they up with the minister for veterans and people my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak al carns who be keen for we not only to support veteran but in particular to look at the exist programme and policy to ensure that they be worthwhile many soldier and other service personnel suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and may be reluctant to come forward and seek help but the people who know they good be their family who can do so on their behalf that be the great thing about the bill it provide that opportunity the hon gentleman be right about the important role that family play in support not just serve personnel but veteran be grateful to he for mention family and to number of other member who speak passionately about that important role that they play and the need for the commissioner to be open to representation from family member be particularly grateful to the hon member for slough who speak about bereaved family in an intervention during the secretary of state speech the bill do not give an exact definition of family member that will be include in secondary legislation that will be publish between the house of commons and house of lords stage be glad that the hon member for epsom and ewell talk about kinship carer and should be happy to discuss they with she we want to get this right and put such definition in the bill will enable it to be lock in want member on both side of the house to feel empower to challenge we and help we to provide that definition so that the bill be draft adequately to help serve personnel and their family to deal with service life and that must include all the shape and size of family as they exist today number of member mention the spending of of gdp on defence to which the government be commit the bill state explicitly that the armed forces commissioner will deal with general service welfare matter think it important for to put that on record because the commissioner will be deal with the live experience of those who serve and their family this will not involve look into secret squirrel operation or operational deployment or the spending of or any other figure it will involve look specifically at the welfare of those who serve however realise that number of member want to make point about the and will continue to encourage they to do so hope that they also welcome the extra billion for defence that be announce in the budget only few week ago several members speak about the armed force covenant and this new government manifesto commitment to put it fully into law reassure they that the determination to do that be strong in the ministerial team the defence secretary himself have make it clear that he want it to be include in the armed force bill which be the next piece of legislation on which the mod will be work be grateful to the members who speak so passionately about the importance of the covenant in their constituency my hon friend the members for stoke on trent central and for hartlepool in particular as well as my hon friend the member for colchester and my next door neighbour my hon friend the member for plymouth moor view speak with passion about armed force champion my hon friend the member for plymouth moor view and share brilliant armed force champion in councillor pauline murphy and her determination and fierce approach to protect and support the armed force family be precisely what hope to see in the armed forces commissioner because we need someone who will focus relentlessly on improve service life when the bill go into committee next month we shall be able to explore these issue in more detail but particularly for the benefit of the royal british legion and poppyscotland will the minister before he sit down update the house on what point we have reach in respect of the national veterans commissioner the right hon gentleman may have miss my early suggestion that member should take up their point with the minister for veterans and people because this bill be about serve personnel however recognise the genuine concern feel by the organisation that he have mention and encourage he to speak to the veterans minister who be currently look at representation for veteran expect the commissioner to have relationship with host of organisation across the country and be happy for that to be pick up the hon member for strangford ask serious question as believe do the shadow minister the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford about what will happen with complaint be process by the current service complaints ombudsman for the armed forces that be transfer to the armed forces commissioner if it be service complaint and the complaint relate to period of service and be raise within the time limit the armed forces commissioner will continue to investigate even if the complainant have leave the force that be the same as the current scoaf position for new armed forces commissioner investigation it will be at the discretion of the commissioner whether to continue the investigation bear in mind that their investigation will be largely thematic rather than pick up individual case hope that reassure member that the work will continue and any complaint currently be handle by the scoaf will be continue that give good opportunity to thank our current scoaf mariette hughes and her team for their work the bill be design deliberately not to adjust the service complaint system the opportunity to do so in legislation may exist in an armed force bill and be happy to speak to member who have concern about the legislation relate to service complaint so that we can make sure that any edit require be include in the next such bill number of member ask who can raise complaint with the armed forces commissioner be pleased to confirm that whether someone be regular reserve recruit or re joiner they will be able to raise an issue with the commissioner as will family member of those people in relation to the commissioner investigation work that relate to the rank and grade question we expect everyone especially within defence to treat the armed forces commissioner with respect the secretary of state will be require by law to assist the commissioner with their investigation and the appointment process that we be seek to start will be for very senior appointment reassure colleague that the commissioner will require security clearance at high level because of the visit that they may make to military establishment and they will be bind by the official secrets act any investigation and anything they come across on their base visit will be hold in the secrecy and at the classification that it deserve there be number of question about digital access it will be up to the commissioner to decide how people will be able to raise an issue with they rather than for we to specify it in the bill but understand the issue that colleague have raise and would expect the commissioner to be fully accessible on various platform both digital and non digital my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar ask the devolution question as this be reserved matter it be the responsibility of the westminster parliament to deal with it here however it be conceivable that the armed forces commissioner may investigate an issue that be the responsibility of the westminster government in england but be devolve to wales scotland or northern ireland in such circumstance we anticipate that the armed forces commissioner would engage with devolved assemblies and administrations and would expect relationship to be form between they over time so that any issue could be address fully the legislation will be for the mod to apply and report will ultimately flow through the house of commons defence committee but recognise what my hon friend say and hope that through the operation of the bill that will be develop be really grateful to the shadow secretary of state for join in one of my nerdy pursuit in defence legislation and ask why gibraltar be not cover as former defence minister he will know that the reason gibraltar be often exclude from defence legislation separate from other overseas territory be that it have an agreement with the united kingdom to replicate the armed forces act in its own legislation but serve personnel and their family station in gibraltar should be in no doubt that they will be able to access the armed forces commissioner reassure the hon member for strangford that clause clearly set out that the bill will apply to northern ireland and indeed all member of our united kingdom family of nation number of colleague mention the commissioner budget the budget have be model on input from the german model that be why we be propose an increase from the current scoaf budget to million to million the shadow minister wonder why that figure arise few time in the debate if he turn to page of the explanatory note he will see that it say suspect that be the reason why so many member raise the figure but it will be for the commissioner to determine how many staff they wish to employ in what role and how the budget be allocate the chair of the defence committee ask how the bill sit with our broad strategy for our armed force personnel this be our first step in our work of renew the contract between the nation and those who serve it be exactly right as be mention early that it form only one part of what we have announce the wraparound childcare announcement that the secretary of state make at the weekend be good example of the direction of travel that people serve in our armed force should expect from this government clear direction that say we will look not only at the kit capability and doctrine in the strategic defence review but at the live experience for each and every one who serve to see how we can improve it that relate to the broad strategy about how we can measure success not only in term of the live experience improvement and the additional scrutiny of such issue but the opportunity for we to do that may disagree with my hon friend the member for portsmouth north on where the home of the royal navy be as represent devonport in plymouth but be grateful for all the contribution finally echo the word of my hon friend the member for aldershot who sum up the debate very well when she say that armed force personnel just want the basic equipment that they need to be able to do their job and good life for their family because if they be willing to fight for we it be the very least that we can do commend the bill to the house question put and agree to bill

four child live in poverty but few than that qualified for the old free school meal programme have breakfast club destigmatise the situation and catch those family who be struggle to make end meet these family might be work but they do not qualify under the previous scheme my hon friend make an excellent point about the importance of free breakfast club in get rid of the stigma one in young

which be significant saving for work parent with the roll out of funded breakfast club imagine the money that could remain in the pocket of work family in slough and beyond do my hon friend agree that in constituency such as wolverhampton west the provision of breakfast club for primary school child target number of issue first it give child nutritious meal so that they do not go to school hungry secondly it allow they to socialise with other child before the school day start and thirdly it enable parent to go to work know that their child be well provide for in safe environment my hon friend

have be roll out we have see the scheme educational benefit the institute for fiscal studies find that attendance at breakfast club result in improved healthy eating reduction in child skip breakfast and raise attainment for pupil from the age of seven my hon friend be make an excellent speech about an issue that everyone in the house agree on be lucky enough to visit manor way primary school in my constituency which run breakfast club an issue that the school raise which have also be raise by the department for education be that child on free school meal be less likely to use breakfast club than other child do my hon friend agree that as we roll out breakfast club to school across the country we must focus on ensure pupil on free school meal be able to access breakfast club as well as possible my hon friend make an excellent point there need to be universal roll out all pupil should benefit but the positive impact on those who currently rely on free school meal can not be overstate positive effect have be pass on to pupil who do not attend breakfast club their result have improve because of calm more focused classroom environment the improvement to child attainment and morale that have be see in wales can not be ignore thank my hon friend for secure this important debate he may not know that be teacher for almost seven year in north birmingham use to regularly see and year old kid come into school have have no breakfast and with their lunch for the day be bag of haribo sweet and one litre bottle of energy drink unsurprisingly those kid have disproportionate number of detention and behavioural incident particularly in the afternoon when they have sugar crash do my hon friend agree that far too often the provision of healthy and nutritious food by breakfast club can be overlook my hon friend speak with great deal of experience be sure the minister and his team will take the contribution make by hon member on board because they be set out how we will make positive impact on the life of those in our community that be what we be elect to do draw on our various diverse experience background and perspective breakfast club provide further potential benefit as my hon friend have highlight proper sit down breakfast among peer not only allow child to access healthy food but encourage the building of interpersonal relationship and the progression of social skill key aspect of child development that be often overlook in an educational setting will the minister assure that universal breakfast club will not only provide healthy meal for young child but also facilitate and encourage development of vital social skill my hon friend be make fantastic speech york hungry minds be currently carry out pilot project examine what happen when school have breakfast club and universal free school meal do he agree that we need to look at the outcome of that evidence to determine whether some child also require free school meal in the middle of the day as well as at the start of the day to ensure that there be equity in the outcome we be seek my hon friend speak with great deal of experience have see over the last seven or eight year in the house that she have do great deal of work to counter poverty and some of the bad problem that our society face everything should be evidence base it be important that the government build on that to help our community far as biologist and teacher believe that link breakfast club with dental hygiene practice will have significant impact on the long term health of our child and indeed of our adult population and eventually on the nhs and our economy do my hon friend agree fully agree my hon friend also speak from experience can see many teacher present and people who be lot more knowledgeable than be thank she for her contribution hope that all member contribution will be consider by the government because of the far reach impact that their suggestion would have as the mp for slough have particular interest in this matter which be why apply for the debate and be grateful to the house authority for grant it quarter of my constituent be under the age of which be why say that we be the youth capital of britain sadly however of child in slough live in relative poverty and live in absolute poverty nearly be eligible for free school meal and the roll out of breakfast club will provide thousand of my slough constituent with well start in life the statistic in hyndburn be even more shocking with of child grow up in poverty today statistic from the social mobility commission outline that one in three child across the uk be grow up in poverty that be the inheritance that we receive and it be evident from the empty conservative benches that not everyone in the house take the issue seriously do my hon friend agree that it be important that the roll out of the pilot target community such as our that have the high level of deprivation where we know it will have the most impact my hon friend have be passionate advocate for her constituent particularly on these issue she be right as say in my introductory sentence where be his majesty loyal opposition no conservative members be present it be important that those who feel passionately advocate on behalf of their constituent in the chamber thank my hon friend for call the debate and everybody who have contribute to it as somebody who grow up in significant financial hardship know the importance of receive warm meal from school or club will he join in commend the work of pokesdown community primary school and the leadership of alison bayliss and chef russ in provide nutritious meal to the child at pokesdown will he also commend lovechurch bournemouth for provide free breakfast to many child in the local community will he reflect on the fact that the opposition benches be desert after year in government the conservative really should put somebody up to explain what they do so wrong thank my hon friend for his passionate remark with which concur commend the great work be do in his constituency it be important that individual realise some of the damage that they have do over the last year which have lead to crumble school and to child be unable to concentrate in school well chance for child to reach their potential and escape the vicious cycle of poverty can be attain to ensure that ask the minister when we can expect the roll out of free breakfast club to be fully implement will that require new legislation if so what be the timeframe thank my hon friend for ensure that this important subject be highlight in the house in my constituency school such as connaught school for girl ensure that every child receive free school meal at the start of the day through charity such as magic breakfast which enable up to pupil across both in england and scotland to receive that privilege however do he agree that it should not be down to club and advocacy group to ensure that provision and rather it should be do through policy drive by government thank my hon friend and fellow member of the defence committee not only have he be passionate advocate on defence but he have advocate for his constituent on numerous matter today fully concur with his view have attend various magic breakfast event and see some of the great work do by charity it be wonderful and heartening to see that there be people who care within our community but it should not be just up to charity this be an issue affect everybody within society and it be great to see new labour government take leadership on it in the fulham part of my constituency child in primary school have enjoy free breakfast since the council initially negotiate that from developer and now it pay for they itself it have also start provide free school lunch at one of the school in fulham do my hon friend agree that the threshold for child to receive free school meal be currently far too high and that we ought to be aim for every child to be give free breakfast and free lunch to avoid the stigma that can damage child confidence and impair their performance it be wonderful to see some of the work happen within my hon friend constituency that be another aspect of this debate because normally his constituency would be associate with be more affluent but among all of our constituency there be pocket of serious social deprivation and child go without the meal that be require be sure that the minister will have hear his view and be hopeful that in due course that be something that the government may well be able to implement free breakfast club be about fight not only poverty but obesity in slough shockingly of child age to be obese we also see high than average prevalence of cardiovascular disease tired hungry and cold that be how one headteacher tell number of her pupil come to school feeling when visit primary school in torbay last week be impressed with how her team be support those youngster both emotionally and with material support whether for hunger or for feel cold it be very sad that one of the pupil be show blanket to other because it be keep they warm do the hon gentleman agree that the more opportunity we give for youngster in our school to get warm meal the more we can drive positive change for our community order can tell from the number of contribution that this debate be important to many colleague however member should be here at the beginning of the debate if they wish to make intervention thank you very much for that clarification madam deputy speaker thank the hon gentleman for his intervention he be right take this moment also to pay tribute to the amazing teacher and staff at school who go way beyond the call of duty to look after child and who be face not only with young hungry child but sometimes with child who do not even have clean uniform because with the cost of living pressure their family can not get their school uniform wash regularly thank my hon friend for secure this important debate want to raise the work that our teacher and school staff do to ensure that our child get hot meal at lunch time and now hopefully in the morning as well we must ensure that we give our child the good start on school day and the roll out of breakfast club will help we to do that my hon friend be right hope that teacher and teaching staff will take comfort and solace from the fact that policy be now be implement to help rather than hinder they they will be able to do their primary duty of educate kid and broaden their horizon rather than have to worry about feeding and clothe they in an appropriate manner healthy habit start early what consideration will be give to the nutritional value of meal provide to child as the minister will know ensure that all child be give nutritious and healthy meal when they come to school will improve not only attainment but health outcome it be not just child whose life will be improve via access to breakfast club because indirect economic benefit will also stem from this scheme right now of mother who have their young child in primary school be unemployed and be in part time employment with childcare cost ballooning great access to round the clock care will mean that parent do not have their career dictate by the school run parent will have more support and independence to find full time employment rise will give way to the mayor of west of england no less do my hon friend share my dismay that the opposition benches be empty although this be such an important issue for rural community such as the one represent where the geography make social isolation big issue breakfast club be very important in deal with that isolation and be amazed that there be not more or indeed any members on the opposition benches give his experience from his mayoral role my hon friend will be fully cognisant of some of the issue face by our rural community yes it be flabbergast to see not single member of

the glass ceiling as well as the class ceiling with pupil currently use breakfast club every day it be essential to ensure that those who want to access they can do so what step be the government take
