year to come there will be more investment in defence from both the public and the private sector as part of their pursuit of the ever elusive goal of economic growth the government have rebrande the uk infrastructure bank as the national wealth fund even the office for budget responsibility have cast doubt on the effectiveness of that as driver of economic growth can the chancellor tell the house how much the rebrand have cost the national wealth fund be do important work in enable we to leverage in private sector investment the most recent of those investment include mine in cornwall and energy charging point in our road at the end of last week announce that the fund would play more important role in funding and support investment in the defence sector which will become even more important in the year ahead recently visit business in kirkby in ashfield in the east midland funnily enough do not see the hon member for strangford jim shannon there where be tell that the increase in national insurance contribution would cost the business year which will prevent it from recruit people and give its employee pay rise next year do the chancellor agree that it be time to reverse

potential impact of the plan increase in employer national insurance contribution on economic growth what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the plan increase in employer national insurance contribution on economic growth the government have take difficult decision to repair the public finance fund public service and restore economic stability the office for budget responsibility predict that the employer national insurance contribution change will reduce the level of potential output by per cent at the forecast horizon it also predict that growth will pick up next year and that living standard will rise fast during this parliament than during the last and in the long term it expect the autumn budget policy if sustain to increase the size of the economy permanently my constituent alison run stepping stones nursery school which have be operate in my constituency for year offer wraparound care to busy family the increase in employer national insurance contribution alone will cost it year and it be still struggle with an increase in utility cost while other nursery in the area be also struggle and indeed closing headmaster hairdresser in walton be struggle with of extra cost owe primarily to this tax rise can the minister explain to business in esher and walton how the government national insurance policy will deliver growth or high living standard give that it seem to be do neither the government decision to increase employer national insurance contribution be one of the tough decision that we take at the budget but it be necessary to restore stability to the public finance it be only on the basis of have stable public finance and fiscal responsibility that we can boost the investment and growth that will make people across britain well off as the poor growth figure show the chancellor job tax be really hurt business not least in our hospitality sector in my constituency pub such as the eel pie and the king head as well as the family run restaurant shambles be really struggle with soar cost and put off hire people if the chancellor will not reverse her job tax will she at the very least consider extend the current business rate relief for hospitality until the new system that she have announce be in place the hon member speak about business rate relief we have to remember that the business rate relief for retail hospitality and leisure be due to end entirely in april under the plan we inherit from the conservative party despite the tough of contexts we decide to extend the relief for another year before the permanently low rate for retail hospitality and leisure come in from april do the minister agree that planning reform be essential for high growth and low taxis be he like concern that the anti growth opposition we see before we in this house will vote against the forthcoming planning and infrastructure bill which be possibly the most significant piece of pro growth legislation that this parliament will see in decade my hon friend be absolutely right about the centrality of plan reform to get the economy grow indeed one of the first action that the chancellor announce on take office be to scrap the ban on onshore wind turbine in the planning system which have be hold back our clean energy transition hope that some opposition members might take the opportunity during today question to confirm that they will support our reform to the planning system because they be indeed vital to growth in this country do the minister agree that it be in the interest of business to see waiting list in the nhs reduce road repair and the public finance fix do he agree that if opposition party do not agree with labour plan they should set out how they would pay for such improvement my hon friend be absolutely right that stability in the public finance be crucial to ensure that we boost investment and growth across the country he be also right to point out that have public service back on their foot after year of decline under the conservative party in government be essential not only to make people in this country healthy more able to get around and well off but to get our economy grow because it be on that basis that business will invest call the shadow minister even before labour job tax come into force we can see the damage that it be do three quarter of million job in hospitality will be subject to employer national insurance for the first time cost billion give that major hospitality and retail business be warn that lower pay and part time worker will suffer most will the chancellor think again can the minister at least commit that there will be no further increase during this parliament the business to which the hon gentleman refer like business in all sector of the economy benefit from the stability that this government have bring to the economy he want to talk about unemployment and the rate of job we recognise that make change to employer national insurance contribution be tough decision that will have consequence but the unemployment rate will fall to next year and remain low until when take together the budget measure mean that the employment level in this country will increase from million in to million in call the liberal democrat spokesperson health and wealth be two side of the same coin and we will not get economic growth without healthy population but as result of the national insurance contribution change the care provider alliance report that of social care provider will have to refuse new care package from local authority or the nhs and that will have to hand back exist contract what assurance can the government provide to the huge number of people who be very scared that they will have to go without care and see their life deteriorate the hon lady make an important point but it be also important to point out that tough decision on taxation must be make to fund the very service she be keen to support on her specific point about these pressure we announce at the provisional local government settlement furth million for adult and child social care to support authority in deliver key service this will be allocate through the social care grant which will bring the total increase in this grant in to million mean that up to billion of additional funding will be provide to social care authority in minister will be aware of analysis from the nuffield trust show that that additional grant be be dwarf by the additional cost that the government be introduce on the great british high street we know that our high street be beautiful feature of our city market town and village but hospitality retail beauty and other service sector be say that the combination of national insurance and other change will be real hammer blow if high street shop start to close that be bad for economic growth and bad for confidence what mechanism will ministers put in place to monitor the impact of the national insurance contribution change on the vibrancy and resilience of our high street all measure in the budget be of course analyse by the treasury and the office for budget responsibility ahead of their announcement and we keep in constant contact with industry representative to see how policy be work in practice draw her attention to my early remark to her hon friend the member for twickenham munira wilson about our business rate reform which be vital ask from the retail hospitality and leisure sector after year of chop and change from the conservative party change relief from one year to the next and offer no stability whatever to people in that sector we be introduce permanently low rate for the retail hospitality and leisure sector from april and avoid the complete end of relief that the conservative party leave in the in tray when we arrive in office economic growth new transport infrastructure what step she be take with cabinet colleague to increase economic growth through new transport infrastructure what step she be take with cabinet colleague to increase economic growth through new transport infrastructure the growth mission be the central mission of this government and transport be an important enabler of that growth the spending review deliver billion cash increase to the transport budget in compare with represent real term growth with record spending further announcement will be make in the spending review in my constituency stevenage borough council be work to secure job and opportunity with town centre regeneration under way and over council home deliver but outdated infrastructure be hold back growth business have be clear with that upgrade stevenage station gateway would unlock growth with the prospect of job be deliver and billion benefit to the economy each year will my right hon friend meet to discuss how we can make the most of this opportunity to unlock economic growth through more infrastructure investment my hon friend be absolutely right that invest in infrastructure will enable growth in city town and village across the whole of our united kingdom we will set out further detail alongside the spending review in our year infrastructure strategy in june no doubt stevenage be sit between london and the oxford cambridge corridor will benefit enormously from announcement already make but decision on specific scheme will be take by the department for transport follow the spending review the midland rail hub project would represent major investment in rail infrastructure across the west midland crucially it would mean more frequent train on the cross city line which serve lichfield before the pandemic that be the busy commuter line in the country outside london what assurance can minister give and my constituent that more train will be come on this line and come soon thank my hon friend who be strong champion for his constituency for raise this rail project in relation to such project the case that he have make will be an important part of our consideration in the month ahead as part of the spending review will arrange for he to meet the appropriate transport minister as we make those consideration the great university city of york and hull be unusual in that they do not have direct rail line between they the whole region labour mp liberal democrat councillor conservatives be unite in believe that reopen the beverley to york line so that the two great minster of hull and york can be reconnecte would bring economic growth and bright future for the area will the minister agree to meet and colleague to discuss this project and how it could help unlock the growth that we all seek across the house be sorry to hear that the right hon gentleman fail to persuade his party when in government for year to open that line can reassure he that this government take rail infrastructure seriously and will happily consider any detail that he wish to write to about economic growth through infrastructure development could be help in scotland and northern ireland with more money go to cairnryan port and the road infrastructure to it ally to that any help that the department the minister and the chancellor could give in resolve eu relate trading issue would considerably help northern ireland business as well as scottish business the hon member will know that the government have enter negotiation with our counterpart in the european commission to improve trade between the uk and the european union have great meeting to discuss these issue last week in cardiff with finance ministers from the northern ireland executive as well as from scotland and wales and note that we have give record break increase in funding to the devolved government so that they can get on with such project work in partnership with we where we still have responsibility regional growth england what step she have take to increase regional growth in england what fiscal reform she have make to help increase economic growth in cumbria at autumn budget we set out the first major step in our approach to regional growth through devolution investment and reform the january growth speech regional investment package build on that we have make clear the government focus on attract inward investment across the country and to invest in infrastructure need to support city and region to grow we have make it clear that the importance of invest in major city region across the uk will play an important part in that endeavour for example if we improve the productivity gap in manchester birmingham and leeds we estimate we can deliver an extra billion in economic output call graham stringer interruption sorry mr speaker be nearly as shock when you call as be when listen to the chancellor of the exchequer on radio talk about economic growth she say there have not be new runway build in this country since manchester airport would be very surprised to hear that because its new runway have be operate for nearly year be shock by that but not really surprised because think many official in the treasury who advise her show startling ignorance of the english region and that lead to certain prejudice in the formula they use to calculate whether scheme should go ahead can the minister and the rest of the treasury team provide coach to send treasury official around the english region to talk to people who know about growth secondly will he look at the formula that decide where economic growth happen which be bias against the region thank my hon friend for his question will do my good to answer they can confirm that treasury official routinely engage with local and regional official across the country include frequently in manchester with mayor burnham and his team would point my hon friend gently to some of the announcement make by the chancellor include support for the old trafford development in manchester congratulate the operator of manchester airport on run successful business which we will continue to support in the normal way at the autumn budget the government announce range of support measure for small business include vital support for the retail hospitality and leisure sector will the minister confirm the measure be take to support the independent and important craft brewing and distillery sector in cumbria as the house have already hear today from my hon friend the exchequer secretary to the treasury we have make permanent decision to give business in the retail hospitality and leisure sector certainty that their discount will apply to business rate relief for the long term not just on one year rolling temporary basis as be the case for year under the previous government understand from my hon friend the member for barrow and furness michelle scrogham that the like of shed one gin wolftown and kin vodka in cumbria will benefit enormously from the government policy look forward to visit those establishment with she in due course the golden valley development in cheltenham will bring significant growth to the west it will also back our national security by support gchq now that the chancellor have approve an extra of defence spending for intelligence and cyber will she work with colleague in the ministry of defence the department for science innovation and technology and the cabinet office to agree more funding for this nationally significant development if the defence point be not good enough we could point out that the development will unlock lot of nice new house too visit airbus in newport last week to look at some of the advanced technology we have in this space be tell about the important connection between newport and the hon gentleman region with gchq and the industrial impact that it have on the supply chain in the uk the increase spending on defence announce by the prime minister will have significant positive impact for business such as those and for his region we look forward to set out further detail of that spending in the spending review the marches region of which north shropshire be significant part be hold back by the road run between llanymynech and oswestry which be very dangerous there be frequent crash and hold up on it which both hinder local growth and obviously be danger to life for people live in the area will the minister work with his colleague in the department for transport to ensure that if we can not get bypass we at least get vital improvement on that road can commit to work with dft colleague on project such as that and other around the country as we make decision in the upcoming spending review would make an observation that it be not just about the decision on spending there have be problem in the past where decision have be make and turn and then make and turn again that be difficult for the supply chain and difficult for investor and local community in our multi year capital budget and our year infrastructure strategy which be come in the month ahead we will give stability to the uk economy so that we can get on and deliver project such as the one the hon lady mention call the shadow minister the chancellor have laud the new national wealth fund as key part of the government regional growth ambition the trouble be it be not actually new it be just the uk infrastructure bank with new colour scheme and billion it do not need the prime minister announce at recent labour party political conference that he will allocate million from the national wealth fund for grangemouth but it be suppose to be operationally independent will the minister therefore confirm that that be still the case and that the full independent investment process be follow will he also confirm that the unexpected resignation of the national wealth fund ceo just day before that announcement be not connect find it odd that member on the conservative benches do not welcome an additional billion of investment into our economy it be rather testament to their poor performance on investment over many year in government to answer the hon gentleman specific question can confirm that each of the business case for grangemouth will have to go through the normal process for sign off and that john flint leave the national wealth fund be not in any way connect to the decision take by this government we look forward to appoint his successor in due course investment newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend what step she be take to encourage investment in newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend constituency this be an important question when shockingly household income in the north east hardly grow over the long year of the previous conservative government we need to raise public and private investment which be why we be work with the north east combine authority on its local growth plan the office for investment be work particularly closely with the north east alongside liverpool on develop local growth opportunity with the town access to the world big offshore wind farm cluster of advanced manufacturing firm and an expand energy skill academy more of newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend potential be yet to be tap what discussion be the minister have with the energy secretary to ensure that the investment be there and that green supply chain be anchor in place such as tyneside have spend far too much of my life talk to the now energy secretary but my hon friend be right to highlight the potential of green energy supply chain in her constituency and across the north east this be government commit to secure economic gain alongside energy security from the energy transition in stark contrast to the previous government who think the net zero transition be something on which to create dividing line not job affordable housing supply what step she have take with cabinet colleague to increase the supply of affordable housing at budget the government announce major step towards deliver once in generation increase in social housing include million boost to the affordable home programme increase annual spend to billion the big annual budget for affordable housing in more than decade early this month the government also announce an additional million to fund affordable home that be the difference labour government can make to people across the country wait desperately for secure housing further investment decision will be set out at phase of the spending review will the minister join in pay tribute to the lancaster guardian for its recent investigative report into the reality for many family live in temporary accommodation in the lancaster district that be pair with frustration hear from local house building developer over delay in the planning process in the district what more do the minister think can happen in lancaster to ensure that family in the district actually have secure housing my hon friend know that we be do everything possible in this place to streamline and improve planning legislation and planning process we be provide clear signal to everybody across the country that we need to build and build rapidly not least to meet our housing target local council play an important role in this process as they make decision on local development understand that in lancaster city council she have have some struggle with member of the green party who be become blocker as oppose to builder say to they and to people across the country that they need to get behind the build agenda because that be what the british people vote for to what extent be the chancellor concerned about multiple potential breach by his majesty revenue and customs of its charter since it issue spotlight which impact rental housing supply and be cause real concern among my constituent both landlord and tenant will the minister meet urgently to discuss this matter be afraid that have no idea what the answer be but if the right hon gentleman write to shall make sure that he get an answer public spending value for money what step she be take to help ensure value for money in public spending the government be commit to spend taxpayer money efficiently at the autumn budget we launch the office for value for money to realise benefit from every pound of public spending through phase of the spending review departments be set productivity efficiency and saving target to ensure that every pound of taxpayer money be well spend the next phase of the spending review have go far have ask each department to conduct line by line review of exist day to day budget to identify where spending be no long align with this government priority or be poor value for money thank the minister for his answer as member of the public accounts committee see on weekly basis the waste that exist under the previous government from the billion spend on badly procure covid contract to rwanda scheme that deliver nothing what step will the minister be take to make sure that we deal not only with value for money for the taxpayer but the legacy of waste under the previous government my hon friend be absolutely right interruption conservative member be chuntere but that be their legacy not once in year be zero base review do not once do former conservative ministers require their departments to go line by line through their budget and not once do they think that the responsible thing to do be to go through to check how every pound of taxpayer money be spend instead there be an argument each year how much more money be go to get how much more borrowing will there be to pay for these bill and how many more promise be go to make that know will not deliver the british people be sick to death of that approach to politic and this government be take fundamentally different approach the adoption and special guardianship support fund provide excellent value for money in mid sussex for beacon house which be specialist mental health and trauma clinic unfortunately however the clinic financial future be look uncertain do the minister agree that invest in mental health be always good idea when it come to get people back to work and well again and able to contribute to society will the minister work with the department for education to secure future funding for this vital service agree entirely that mental health service be in desperate need of investment and support across the country the evidence be very clear that there be for example too many people out of work who would be like to be in work but who be wait at home unwell and unable to receive the support and service that they need and deserve the health secretary be work hard on that at the moment we be go into the spending review negotiation over the come week and month and we will set out further detail in due course look forward to be able to provide more information specifically as we go through that process call the shadow minister improve public sector productivity be the ask of institute of directors business try to weather storm rachel but under labour public sector productivity have fall far behind pre pandemic level the number of civil servant work from home have go up and shockingly as the daily telegraph have find thousand of civil servant be be sign off to work from abroad therefore whether it be on civil servant work from their bedroom or from benidorm or on other blocker of public sector productivity what have the chief secretary to the treasury actually do in his last eight month in office or be he too comfortable with what the prime minister call the tepid bath of manage decline thank the hon member for his question my no ask be that he have another go at make well joke in future to answer the substance of his question agree with he that the state be not productive enough on whole range of issue he talk about civil service headcount about government office and location and about work condition he could also talk about digital transformation frankly we have an enormous amount of work to do which will become evident through our spending review it be something that be be take very seriously not just by the treasury but from the prime minister downward look forward to his reflect on what we suggest be the answer to year of failure from his party when it be in government government borrowing what assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of the most recent figure for government borrowing in the autumn take the decision to put our public finance back on firm footing the most recent gdp datum show that the economy grow by in the final month of last year as have say on many occasion our fiscal rule be non negotiable the conservative party send mortgage rate and business borrowing cost spiral we have return stability to the public finance to give family and business the stability that they need the servicing cost be now twice what we be spend on defence which the chancellor be right to be increase what be her ambition for find saving in the welfare budget agree that we need to get grip of the welfare budget which get out of control under the previous conservative government frankly be not go to take lecture from the conservative party which crash the economy let remind the house what the right hon gentleman say about the disastrous mini budget share entirely the free market ideology that underpin the chancellor statement the chancellor be right to be radical he add rejoice at the two finger the chancellor have raise to socialist dogma and envy think that the financial market and the british public have unite in their view on the previous government economic growth scotland what step she have take to help increase economic growth in scotland what step she have take to help increase economic growth in edinburgh north and leith constituency economic growth be the no mission of this government scotland will play an important role at the autumn budget we announce that the scottish government will be provide with billion in its settlement the large in real term in the history of devolution we also confirm million of target funding include for city and growth deal in scotland we have see almost two decade of wasteful spending while public service get bad do the minister agree that good public service be essential to economic growth and that scottish taxpayer be not get good value for money under the snp government on my recent visit to scotland hear just that the people of scotland deserve the same approach that the people of england be get from this government who have stability and economic growth as their mission and who be get grip of public finance after year of failure quite frankly we have give the scottish government the money and they now need to get on with the job if they can not they need to move out of the way be sure that my right hon friend will agree on the importance of the scotch whisky industry support for the industry start at home by attract investment include at the port of leith distillery in my constituency which be produce single malt scotch whisky attract tourist and showcase the good of scottish hospitality my right hon friend will be aware of the industry concern about the watering down of the definition of single malt which will have an impact on investment and growth will he therefore work with cabinet colleague to ensure that no change be make to the definition of single malt that would undermine the scottish success story and investment in the scottish whisky industry scotch whisky be proud british brand and export and this government will always support the industry have check with ministers from the department for environment food and rural affairs and can confirm that we will not be water down the definition of single malt whisky mr speaker you will have see the film skyfall in which james bond and travel up the but the be killer road and we have have litany of broken promise from the snp government that be hardly conducive to economic growth in scotland thank the hon member for his tour of the scenic and for tell we the importance of that road to scotland be sure that support what would have be his question the scottish national party government in scotland ought to take infrastructure seriously as we be do here in the uk government the minister give very good answer to non question we can listen to the braying of labour mp from scotland or we can look at the fact that the scottish economy grow more than the uk economy in that be because of the snp scottish government forensic focus on make scotland the most attractive place in the uk for foreign direct investment year after year have progressive taxation system reward our public sector worker properly and invest in our community what difference do the minister think agricultural property relief and business property relief will have on the scottish economy positive or negative of course when we make change to taxis even when that it be difficult that result in additional funding for the hon member and his colleague to spend be sure he be grateful that we have give record break increase in investment to the scottish government grateful for nothing he may be grateful for nothing and he may be agitate in his place suggest that he go back to the people of scotland and explain his party record in government taxation impact on working people what assessment she have make of the impact of the level of taxation on work people the government be commit to keep taxis on work people as low as possible which be why we be not increase the basic high or additional rate of income tax employee national insurance contribution or vat the government have publish tax information and impact note

march and be accompany by statement to parliament from the chancellor ahead of the statement the government will not give run commentary respond to forecast and economic development but reassure the hon member that the chancellor commitment indeed the whole government commitment to our fiscal rule be non negotiable it should not be work people who pay more tax because wealth inequality be grow in the uk and improve living standard be ultimately what the government will be judge on do the minister see the merit in introduce an annual wealth tax of on people with over million worth of asset which would go an awful long way to raise billion per annum to equalise society hope my hon friend will welcome the million investment in the grangemouth facility which have already be speak about today hope he will also support the government decision to restore fiscal responsibility to public finance within the tough fiscal rule that the chancellor set out at the budget autumn budget business confidence what discussion she have have with business on the potential impact of the autumn budget on level of business confidence economic stability and growth be vital to help business across the

back on this desperate job tax she be in danger of become tough on growth and tough on the cause of growth conservative members welcome the additional money for the nhs but they never welcome the mean to pay for it which be why we be in the mess that we be with the billion black hole we inherit from the previous government the hon member say that these be backward look survey the ey survey of uk ceo find that feel optimistic pwc late global ceo survey rank the uk as the second most attractive global destination for international investment and last week the lloyds survey show boost in

representative organisation from different nation within the uk listen to their concern and what they have to say we have to be honest that we disagree they do not agree with the government policy and need to be direct about that because we have to take number of difficult decision at the budget but do not apologise for the importance of balance the public finance and stick to our fiscal rule next

could be change to that budget in june just to clarify do not say there be an impact assessment say that the impact of the change be be consider by the government but we will set out the detail on that in due course commend the government for their international leadership at this challenging time event overnight make it even clear that europe must find considerably more resource for ukraine the chancellor have rightly continue our policy of use the interest on frozen russian state asset to benefit ukraine but believe that now be the moment to go far by actually seize those asset russia invasion of ukraine violate the principle of sovereign equality provide basis in international law for such policy and by act in concert with our ally we can ensure that there be no risk to financial stability may urge the chancellor to push for co ordinate action to seize those frozen russian state asset and give that money to the ukrainians so that they can defend and rebuild their country thank the right hon gentleman for his word about this government step up the funding for defence last week we expand sanction on russia include by look at financial service this week we have sign off uk

as recent day have show the ceasefire continue to be incredibly fragile of course we all want this agreement to hold and none of we should be in any doubt that that hinge on the release of each and every hostage hold by the iranian back terrorist hamas who cause the conflict by their sickening act on october as the minister have point out those hostage and their family have now suffer unimaginably for more than day and that can not go on the hostage have be hold in barbaric condition and the world have be shock by the distressing scene involve those who have be release the minister

and be push for discussion conversation and dialogue so that aid can get back in follow this urgent question we undertake to contact the red cross one of our partner organisation with the message that this house want that aid to re enter the area and to save life the powerful scene of palestinians celebrate the start of ramadan even as their home and life have be reduce to rubble by israeli force send defiant message to the world that despite the displacement and destruction palestinians remain rooted in their land will the minister confirm that the decision to block all aid to gaza collectively punish the entire population be war crime and breach of international law contravene provision of the geneva convention and the rome statute my hon friend be quite right to point out the devastating impact of no aid get through and to say that halt on good and supply enter gaza such as that recently announce by the government of israel risk breach israel obligation under international humanitarian law it be not for ministers at the dispatch box to make legal decision or judgment but assure my hon friend that the former minister for development pledge million to ensure that healthcare food and shelter can reach ten of thousand of civilian and to support vital infrastructure my hon friend must reassure her constituent that the foreign office be do all it can to get infrastructure across the opt and into gaza in order to relieve the suffering call the liberal democrat spokesperson the israeli government be wrong to prevent humanitarian aid enter gaza that threaten the life of gazans who be dependent on aid after the destruction of the past month and be clear breach of international humanitarian law what practical step be the government take to ensure that the israeli government back down and let that aid in understand the depth of distress in israel about the despicable way that hamas terrorist have play psychological game with the hostage and their family but withhold essential supply of food medicine and shelter only worsen the devastation face by the palestinian people in the west bank we also see illegal settler violently attack palestinians and apparently receive the support of member of the israeli cabinet do the minister agree that we in the uk must do all we can to undermine the extremist in this conflict so that second phase of the ceasefire can be negotiate all hostage can be release and gazans can receive the aid that they desperately need thank the lib dem spokesperson for his word he be quite right to emphasise the psychological impact of this terrible conflict and the traumatise state of people in the region as the foreign secretary have say we welcome the release of the hostage in gaza include of course emily damari whom we have already mention we think so much of those member of the lifshitz family they of course have strong tie to the uk who be hold hostage by terrorist in gaza and who die we thank qatar egypt and the us for provide support to ensure that the horrific ordeal of individual and family can come to an end but unfortunately this be not the end that be why it be so important that we take this moment to push the hon gentleman ask what we be do practically we be in daily contact with the region include our mission there obviously in the context of the international debate intervention such as this urgent question push for just solution for those on both side of this terrible conflict last week be in the west bank alongside other member of the foreign affairs committee on our wide trip to the middle east while the world attention be rightly on the devastating humanitarian situation in gaza we meet palestinians in the jordan valley whose school be be attack whose mosque be be burn and whose livestock be be steal by extremist israeli settler this be happen with the apparent connivance of the israeli security force and it appear to be part of wide plan for annexation what step be we take to prevent further erosion of palestinian land in the west bank that would put the two state solution even far away thank my hon friend for his question and for his expertise on aid and foreign affair he be quite right to emphasise the action of some settler there be many settler community that just get on with it and that want peaceful solution but he be right to say that there be violence in the settlement which be of course unlawful under international humanitarian law and harm the prospect of two state solution thank my hon friend for put on record the impact on the faith community particularly during the holy month of ramadan and the fact that mosque have be attack we will ensure that that point get through in our next discussion with our interlocutor both on the israeli side and on the palestinian side no one be surprised that as soon as the world attention shift from gaza israel reimpose its siege prevent the entry of all humanitarian aid the minister know the impact that this will have on the beleaguered civilian population who be already suffer from disease starvation and an absence of healthcare after month in which israel have be give carte blanche none of we least of all netanyahu expect there to be any meaningful consequence from israel action but do the minister consider what be happen in gaza to be collective punishment if she do not what would she call it sometimes the word we use be really important there have be an enormous amount of suffering we know that so many in israel feel that we do not understand their need for security and so many in gaza feel that we do not understand the depth of their suffering we must redouble our effort to communicate what we want which be two state solution and peaceful future for both community which must live side by side the leader of the arab world have make welcome proposal about the future of gaza and its people what update can the minister give on the uk support for those proposal and will she join in welcome the fact that the proposal recognise that the terrorist death cult hamas can have no part in the future governance of gaza my hon friend be quite right to say that as proscribe terror organisation hamas have certainly display some very frightening characteristic that we would expect of terrorist organisation there be also the macabre pantomime that we see in the past couple of week during the release of hostage that be truly shocking thank he for his question the exact detail on the next stage of the negotiation be to be define by the two party but we play real role both with the ally which be israel but also work with egypt qatar and the wide region that be why our minister right now be in the region make the point that we want to be involve push for peaceful solution and to see that day when terrorism be not extant and the two community can live side by side in peace be go to ask what we would do if the israelis refuse to let in aid or to turn on the water and power but think we all know that basically the answer be nothing instead let ask this the minister rightly mention the macabre display around the return of the hostage and the condition of those hostage and she be right think she say that she have take that up with interlocutor why have not she mention the return of the palestinian non combatant why have not she mention their condition when they be return often emaciated and show sign of torture why have she not mention the number of senior medic who have be detain without charge and then die in mysterious circumstance in israeli detention apparently there be some kind of investigation but it never come to conclusion be she surprised that people have become cynical about british conduct in this conflict when it seem that we be only concerned about the welfare of one side with all due respect think that across this house we have have very balanced approach to the suffering of all the community in the region the right hon member be right to mention the terrible suffering of those who have experience arbitrary detention or alleged torture by various law enforcement agency he be also right to include that in what need to be the next step of the negotiation the hostage on the one side but those be release from prison on the other remind he that there be concern that some people who might have be release should not have be all of that have to be take in the round and balanced encourage balance and understanding about the suffering of both side of the community and the desire for security in the word that we use in the house the issue of collaboration and infiltration between hamas and some unrwa official be well document clearly people in gaza need aid so can the minister update we on how we be monitor the work be do to restore neutrality and confidence in unrwa the uk government have be supporter of the work of unrwa throughout this conflict and before it we have be support unrwa financially as have all international organisation and country there have be problem with certain challenge to individual who have be employ by unrwa but we have consistently join with ally in express our concern about the role of unrwa be curtail at the un security council session on november december january january and february and in joint statement with partner on october we urge that the important work of unrwa can continue the blockade of aid be just the last line in long list of activity that israelis have commit against the palestinian people now that we have cut our overseas aid to mere of gdp the low in real term in year do the minister still agree with the labour party manifesto that international aid make the world safe more prosperous place do she agree that with this move the uk historic role in the middle east be dead and over the hon member be right to talk about the ongoing need for aid in the region and the prime minister be very careful in his speech at the end of last week think he have mention it since then in the press to say that humanitarian aid must continue gaza be specifically mention because it be one of our top priority the hon member be aware that the decision to divert some of our aid spending into the defence of europe be only week old but he must also be aware that we will come forward with the detail of that reassure he and his constituent that gaza be specifically mention in this house by the prime minister because it remain one of our top priority in the foreign office it be clear that israel have be embolden by trumpian tactic in impose total siege and block all supply include humanitarian aid into gaza to force new ceasefire term we in this house should be clear and call that what it be collective punishment of the palestinian people starvation as method of war and blatant war crime will the minister finally sanction israel for these gross violation of international law specifically on the question of sanction think my hon friend know what be go to say which be that we do not talk about they until we make decision we review any tool that we have available to we to protest we also need to understand that we be in the midst of peace process we know that peace process throughout history have have stop start element what we be do be make clear our view the view of this house and of the government that humanitarian aid must not be prevent from enter gaza while this important peace process be go on people still need to eat they still need lifesave medical treatment child still need to be educate that be the point we have continue to make all the way along in her letter resign as development minister last week the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds write that it will be impossible give the depth of the cut to maintain the government support for all their development commitment she explicitly cite aid to gaza at this point commend the totnes friends of palestine for raise to help those in gaza with hospital destroy lack of clean water desperate food shortage and now more threat to power and water supply how will the minister ensure that last week cut to development spending will not worsen the humanitarian catastrophe happen in gaza congratulate the hon member on all the work she do in her community to show international support and solidarity for community in gaza we know that the humanitarian situation remain extremely challenging with more than have be kill and of the population have be displace many repeatedly think the uk have really good story to tell we have be in there for many decade now she mention the outgoing minister for development and furth million be announce on january so that healthcare food and shelter could reach ten of thousand of civilian and to support vital infrastructure the hon member ask about ongoing funding and she be right to ask that question and hold our foot to the fire once we have have time to look at the come financial year and the comprehensive spending review she will have her answer do the minister agree that israel decision to block aid to more than million palestinians in gaza be collective punishment with of gaza health infrastructure destroy medical worker kill and the world health organisation estimate that palestinians include child require urgent medical evacuation what concrete step have we take to ensure that aid get in and that those who need medical treatment have that treatment make available to they thank my hon friend for her ongoing campaigning on humanitarian aid for gaza it be very positive that the rafah crossing remain open that have lead to significant increase in the number of medical evacuation in recent week it be vital for israel to ensure that there be sustained passage for patient who need treatment that be not available in gaza and official from all relevant whitehall departments be explore avenue to ensure that our support well meet the need of the those who be critically ill there the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse talk about the medical staff who be under threat we have

the house on this troubling matter the israeli government decision be contrary to international humanitarian law and clearly undermine such fragile ceasefire both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have be absolutely clear about the right of palestinians to return home to gaza to rebuild their life do the minister agree that their right to return be jeopardise by the blocking of critical humanitarian aid and what action will the government take if that right continue to be restrict my hon friend be right that humanitarian aid should never be contingent on ceasefire or use as political tool and we urge the government of israel to lift restriction immediately and unconditionally he ask what else this government will do we will continue to support the peace process which should involve both side get around the table free the hostage allow the aid in and have vision for the future of this region that be so affect by conflict and death pay tribute to the former development minister my constituency neighbour the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds for her work in this area and also for the wise word in her resignation letter the minister have rightly say that force displacement be unacceptable indeed think she say that the action of the illegal extremist settler be unlawful you may have see the oscars ceremony this week mr speaker which feature an incredible film call no other land which highlight the force displacement in masafer yatta and be make by israelis and palestinians together it win the oscar bet they would trade every gong go for that film to have its desire effect and for the violence to stop we can do something and if ever there be time for we to ban the illegal settlement good that fund those extremist settler be now not that time thank the hon lady for all her work in the community and also in the house educate member not just on the two side that we always think about but on the christian community in gaza and in palestine the palestinian christians who be so much affect by the current conflict she mention the uk position on settlement want to be clear that our position be that they be illegal under international law present an obstacle to peace and threaten the physical viability of two state solution many member have speak about the importance of humanitarian aid which be vital to save so many life but the role of the aid worker who be work on the ground in horrific condition be also vital accord to estimate more than have be kill the high number on record but we see many aid organisation be attack on social medium with claim that they have link to terrorist organisation what more can the minister do to make clear the government support for these vital international aid worker and organisation they include islamic relief base in my constituency which be one of the uk five non governmental organisation certify by the core humanitarian standard in respect of aid and transparency what more can we do to support these vital aid worker thank my hon friend for her important work in this regard and thank those aid organisation that be base just across the river not only must aid reach those who need it in all area but the important work of aid worker must be respect and they must be protect it be horrify to hear report that for example six baby have die from hypothermia and cold relate injury in gaza in just two week islamic aid the red cross and all the other organisation that make up the partnership across the region must be able to get into gaza to do their important work and must also allow to bring in good such as tent medical equipment and machinery that be need to support the resumption of basic service in gaza thank the minister for her response to the urgent question over the weekend and in the chamber yesterday the prime minister make very clear his support for ukraine until peace be achieve for which be eternally grateful but will the minister confirm that our support remain with israel as we attempt to secure peace for now and lasting solution to maintain it and that we hope that future can be achieve for the child on both side of the gaza boundary thank the hon member for mention the child involve in this conflict he be well aware of the trauma that can be pass down from generation to generation and of the many orphan in the region thank he for his commitment to the state of israel and secure future for its people so that the suffering of people in palestine can also come to an end as well as express my sadness and alarm about the netanyahu government again block aid from enter gaza may point out that over the year have repeatedly express my concern in parliament about the forced eviction and illegal settlement in the west bank now shockingly for the first time in two decade there be tank in jenin and far displacement of palestinians what representation be the government make to the israeli government that aid must not be block from enter gaza and that this illegal occupation and these further eviction must be stop immediately my hon friend question give further opportunity to emphasise that israeli settlement be illegal under international law and harm the prospect for two state solution the foreign secretary have make it clear to israeli ministers on number of occasion that their government must clamp down on settler violence and end settler expansion thank the minister for mention orphan who unfortunately do not have much of voice in this place although sadly there be too many in the world as we see more and more conflict agree with my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse that civilian life be just as precious whether they be israeli or palestinian and that we should do all we can across the house to save life fear however this may be surprise that the big foreign policy headache for the government over coming month may be not ukraine but israel with the divergence of the new american administration over israel be of great concern do the minister accept what have be agree today at the arab summit in cairo billion five year reconstruction plan for gaza which will allow displace palestinians to return no trump gaza riviera and country in the region put palestinians back into gaza and at the heart of its future thank the hon member for his question which have many aspect he be aware that the majority of home in gaza have be damage or destroy the economy have collapse and the delivery of basic service include energy and water have be badly affect over of the electricity distribution network have be damage or destroy over of main road be damage profoundly limit the mobility of people aid and good that be why the underlining of the billion be so welcome we be supportive of regional effort cohere around single workable reconstruction plan for gaza and we support the regional expertise in construction to get go on that on the hon gentleman question about orphan he be perhaps aware that one of the foreign secretary main area of concern be the welfare of child particularly child who be orphan or in need of adoption or foster will take back the concern that he express about that workstream on which we do quite lot in the foreign office and emphasise its importance the suffering of palestinian child who have be attack by israeli drone be devastating and the fact that those child be deny medical support and assistance be even more so the minister have say that we be look at medical evacuation but do she agree that action speak louder than word when will enough be enough and when will these child get the attention that they so desperately need other country be provide support right now my hon friend be quite right to talk about child whether it be in sudan ukraine or anywhere else we know that child suffer deep trauma as result of conflict and we be deeply alarmed by the disproportionate impact of the conflict on child in gaza half of gaza population be child and the consequence of ten of thousand be kill injure or separate from their parent threaten not only their individual future but the very fabric of palestinian society for generation to come most if not all student in gaza have not have access to education since october and at least of school building will need full or major reconstruction my hon friend be quite right to ask what we be do the uk be support the restoration of education service in gaza include through the un office for the co ordination of humanitarian affairs and the un relief and works agency for palestinian refugees in the near east she will be aware of the important work to maintain the ceasefire so that we have hope of realise the reconstruction dream be very pleased to hear the minister emphasise that the withholding of humanitarian aid be direct contravention of international humanitarian law what step be her government take to work with partner in the region and in europe to apply pressure on the israeli government to ensure that the flow of critical aid be no long impede that be precisely why we have ministerial visit to the region to emphasise the importance not only to the government but to this house of the message that we must keep push for peaceful future in the meantime we must provide enough food to eat and enough water to wash and to cook to educate child and keep people healthy and safe have the government carry out an assessment of the impact of the withdrawal of usaid from the region in light of any assessment that may have be carry out be the government confident that the decision to cut the international aid budget will not be an increasingly detrimental problem in gaza understand that the prime minister have say that funding for gaza be ringfence and that our humanitarian aid will continue but be concerned that the withdrawal of american aid may leave vacuum that we can not fill it be true that over the decade the people of the usa have be generous in provide aid across the world include in the region it will be almost impossible to replace the important work that usaid have do over the decade in the middle east will not however give up hope because we have to keep make the case for work together internationally lot of the work in the region be do by partner work multilaterally much of that work have be do by usaid but it be also about try to encourage other country include those in the region that have more vibrant economy to step up to the plate and fill the gap on my hon friend specific question about the assessment it be not complete because the decision be still relatively recent as be our own decision on unrwa week ago trust that we will come back to the house when we know the shape of the comprehensive spending review and how we will address this difficult problem on monday the london school of economics middle east centre will host the launch of book call understanding hamas one contributor to the book azzam tamimi have previously call for the destruction of the state of israel speaker at the event deny that hamas be terrorist organisation and wrongly dismiss israel as white settler colonialist nation will the minister join in say very clearly that this be not an accurate description of israel there be no genocide as hear an hon member claim early and hamas be terrorist organisation that seek to murder jews and have bring nothing but destruction and disaster to the people of gaza thank the hon gentleman for do his research before come to the house and can confirm that hamas be terror organisation that be proscribe by our government for those reason it be really important that we be robust in our defence of the right of the state of israel our ally to exist the people of both israel and palestine have be fail by their leadership with horrific consequence one person who know that more than most be my constituent father oded lifschitz whose coffin we see parade horrifically through the street of khan yunis we should say his name in this place because he dedicate his life to secure peace between israel and palestine he drive ambulance over the border to help palestinian people we can be clear in this chamber that withhold aid and use starvation as weapon of war be wrong but if we want to challenge that leadership we must step up ourselves the minister previously speak about what we be do to try to support medical need in gaza for the avoidance of doubt may oded memory be blessing and in his cause we will follow up can the minister be clear that we will evacuate people who need medical assistance from gaza to the uk the lifschitz family have great champion in my hon friend who have come to the house and lay out in clear term her expectation of the government there be certain scheme to assist family in medical emergency with her permission will write to she with the detail and the exact guideline that be use by the government to determine who be eligible for those scheme there have now be know death in gaza israel be already accuse by the icj and the icc of war crime include genocidal act and it be now commit new war crime by deny food and water to the people of gaza what will it take for the british government to cease all arm supply to israel and to end the use of the raf base in akrotiri as staging point for delivery to israel when will we end the security co operation with israel to make it absolutely clear that we be not prepared to support regime that be break international humanitarian law in so many respect as the right hon member be aware as soon as the foreign secretary take office he order review of the compliance with international humanitarian law of various export item follow the review the government suspend export licence to israel in number of category assess where there be clear risk that they might be use to commit or facilitate serious violation of international humanitarian law as the right hon member will also be aware the question of genocide be not for minister to determine at the dispatch box legal expert continue to look at the definition and description of act of war and they will come forward with their determination over time rise order be plan to run this urgent question for only about another minute so it would be very helpful if question be short please over recent day we have see the power of co ordinate action when address most challenging diplomatic military and humanitarian crisis yet in month we have not see parallel in address the challenge over gaza what action be the department take to ensure that there be such co ordinate effort and will the foreign secretary call such summit thank my hon friend for that suggestion the uk will certainly continue to work as it have do ceaselessly with israel the palestinian authority the us and regional partner to build consensus for post conflict gaza governance and security framework that support condition for permanent and sustainable peace her request have be hear in the chamber what message do the minister think the government send about their commitment to international aid in gaza and indeed anywhere else by not only cut it to which be its low level this century but remove the ability of this house to scrutinise that cut or any remain spend by move ministerial responsibility for aid and development from this chamber to the other place thank the hon member for her question there will be an opportunity in the estimate debate later this week for she to ask further question however as be sure she be aware give her expertise in aid and development and in soft power it will take some time for the comprehensive spending review to come forward with picture of the resource implication know that she and her party fundamentally support the decision to look at the security of europe and to try to make that part of the balance in our foreign policy work understand that the minister do not want to give legal opinion but be it not clear that ban all supply to gaza be breach of the geneva convention and the rome statute failure to call that out embolden israel in its collective punishment of all gazans will she confirm as it be miss from her early response that when the government finally recognise the palestinian state it will include not only the west bank and gaza but east jerusalem as its capital thank my hon friend for all his work as the vice chair of the britain palestine all party parliamentary group and for his ongoing campaigning in this area to be clear humanitarian aid should never be contingent on ceasefire or use as political tool and jerusalem should of course be the share capital my constituent be horrify at report that the uk government be not only complicit in israeli atrocity but have actively and directly participate in the war crime and ethnic cleansing perpetrate by israel will the minister explain to this house what the uk participation and role have be in the israeli genocide and the ongoing atrocity that continue in gaza and the west bank as have mention it be not for the minister here but for legal expert to determine the definition of genocide on the role of the uk the reason as the indo pacific minister be before the house be that my hon friend the minister with responsibility for the middle east be currently engage in conversation and push for peaceful solution there can be nothing well than face to face meeting with minister of his majesty government in the region have those important discussion and push for peace with almost palestinian child have be kill gaza and its people be in state of devastation the use of starvation as weapon of war be war crime the denial of humanitarian aid be war crime and it lead to baby freeze to death an example the minster give early what specific action be the government take with ally to pressure the israeli government to comply with international law and let aid into gaza thank my hon friend for all the work she do before she enter parliament on aid and support international solution for war affect area our work continue with our partner israel the palestinian authority the us and regional partner to build consensus because we all want to live in world where aid be no long necessary and there be vibrant economy and people have job school and hospital that be what the uk be do redouble our effort for post conflict gaza governance and security framework that support condition for permanent and sustainable peace it have be very frustrating to hear about this government practical inaction in the face of flagrant breach of international law in the siege of gaza and sincerely hope that the government do not continue down this path of inertia with that in mind what step be the minister take to recognise palestine as state immediately as part of the two state solution base on the border this be surely essential to reinvigorate the peace process and deter extremist seek perpetual conflict in gaza the west bank and across the middle east the hon member be quite right to describe what feel like hopeless situation but would remind he that over the last few week we have see some ray of sunlight and few bit of hope as hopefully less violence be be perpetrate and more people be go back to their home however he be right to push the government and to ask what more can be do and that include visit to the region to speak to the interlocutor have mention and to keep push for peace of course many of we in this house want to see progress towards permanent two state solution follow the current ceasefire and hostage deal in december the prime minister announce that the foreign secretary would be convene meeting of partner to support civil society in both israel and palestine what update can the minister provide to the house on how the uk plan to support the international forum for israeli palestinian peace in the short term israeli military withdrawal from gaza will be phase all party have agree to that but in time we must see the occupation end as confidence be rebuild in gaza and israel the palestinian authority should play key role in the future governance and security of gaza for the deal to work we need all party to co operate include on future security arrangement that protect both israelis and palestinians and allow the safe distribution of aid in the vision of the two state solution despite the appalling abuse of the hostage who be release and the propaganda value make of they in day the israeli government have allow truckload of aid into gaza which be enough to sustain the entire population for four month nonsense it be fact the concern be that hamas be now use aid as their major source of income and be seek to control the billion dollar aid industry there now be in gaza what assurance can the minister give that uk aid will not be use to sustain that terrorist organisation or to control the local population if the right hon member be read thing online he need to be careful that they be correct because while there have be recent arrival of aid we all know that there be continue need for aid we all want to eat fresh food we all need fresh medication and we all need water and all those other thing and the essential aid go in need to be refresh every day what we can say in this house be that provide access to essential civilian service with that aid be also crucial encourage he to widen his source of read on the access of aid into gaza and the west bank institute an aid blockade while get on for gazans have be kill and there be polio epidemic surely look as if civilian deprivation be be use as weapon of war what be the government do about that and to ensure that the entire fragile ceasefire do not fall apart and the hostage can come home thank my hon friend for specifically mention polio we be very pleased to hear that the late polio vaccination roll out reach of the child who be target but we remain gravely concern by the lack of adequate medical care in wide sense in gaza all prisoner detain in gaza include medical staff must be allow full international committee of the red cross access other than the minister response to the excellent question from the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse strongly welcome both the tone and content of the minister answer it be clear that there be no justification for the vindictive and counterproductive action of the israeli government but they be clearly embolden by the us president in seek to build international alliance to put pressure on the israeli government to change their action and stop that vindictive behaviour what conversation be the government have to ensure that their view be convey to the united states so they can adopt the same line as we be to provide clarification on some of the idea that have be propose for example on the future of gaza we have make it clear that we would oppose any effort to move palestinians in gaza to neighbour arab state and the forced displacement of palestinians or any reduction in the territory of the gaza strip be simply not an option thank the hon gentleman for help to keep we on track with what people in the region actually want and for support around the table all partner who be push for peaceful deal between the two party do the minister agree that especially at time of such intense suffering for so many civilian in gaza this use of both humanitarian assistance and aid be totally unacceptable and not conducive to last ceasefire and long term peace my hon friend be quite right to emphasise the need for the steady inflow of aid anything else could potentially be breach of international humanitarian law what we see in peace process be hiccup one step forward and two step back we would be push for all party to see this as hiccup hope to wake up tomorrow morning to the happy news that all be back on track aid be get in conversation be happen and that the peaceful future we all want for the two party be become reality hong kong democracy activists to ask the home secretary to make statement on the bounty place on hong kong democracy activist in the united kingdom by the chinese communist party and other authority in hong kong and china thank the right hon gentleman for his question on what agree be very serious matter security be the first duty of government as such we be deeply concerned by the recent bounty place on hong kong democracy activist resident here in the uk as the right hon gentleman will know the foreign secretary issue statement condemn those bounty as he say at the time the individual be merely exercise their right to freedom of expression as the foreign secretary have also say we call on beijing to repeal the national security law include its extraterritorial reach we also call on the hong kong authority to end their targeting of individual in the uk and elsewhere for seek to exercise their basic right minister have raise those concern with the authority during recent visit to both hong kong and beijing the continued safety of hong kongers remain priority for this government it would not be appropriate for to comment on individual case but want to be clear that we will not tolerate any attempt by foreign government to coerce intimidate harass or harm their critic overseas especially here in the uk we have receive assurance from counter terror policing that the appropriate measure be in place for the individual in question and we regularly assess potential threat to the uk and use all available lever to counter they where we identify individual at heighten risk we be front foot in deploy protective security guidance and other measure as appropriate anyone anyone act to coerce individual in the uk be liable to prosecution under the national security act to date there have be six individual charge under the new act the government position be clear we will protect the right and freedom of all individual in the uk we will use every available power and tool to uphold the principle we hold dear this be an incredibly serious issue the chinese communist party be an authoritarian regime which have be persecute people in hong kong mainland china and elsewhere for some time nearly people that we know about have be arrest for political reason in hong kong since july last year it be completely unacceptable that harassment and intimidation take place now on british soil it be gross infringement of the liberty of the individual concern and it be an affront to british sovereignty bounty amount to approximately each have apparently be place on three people who be in the united kingdom tony chung aged carmen lau age and chloe cheung aged only all flee hong kong owe to persecution chloe cheung be apparently advise by the police to dial if she feel under threat which strike as an inadequate response understand that poster appear near the home address of two of those people and that letter be post to their neighbour offer reward if they be deliver to the chinese embassy that be completely unacceptable that can not be tolerate and robust action must be take have couple of question to put respectfully to the security minister first have the chinese ambassador be summon by the foreign secretary to the foreign office to have it explain to he that this be unacceptable and to ask what be be do to stop it my understanding be that no such summon have be issue which be unacceptable do that not make clear that give the chinese permission to build mega embassy in london be completely inappropriate it will simply be use as pan european base for chinese spying be investigation into the perpetrator under way why be china not be place into the enhance tier under the foreign influence registration scheme surely china should be place into that tier as matter of urgency what be the update on the chinese police station operate covertly in the united kingdom be brief on that as policing minister year or so ago where be we with those finally the security minister say that we will not tolerate this happening be sure the whole house will agree with that but what concrete and tangible action be be take to prevent these outrage be grateful to the shadow home secretary for his point and question let again for the avoidance of doubt be absolutely clear about the government position the safety and security of hong kongers in the uk be of the upmost importance and the uk will always stand up for the right of the people of hong kong wherever we identify such threat we will use any and all measure include through the use of our world class intelligence service to mitigate the risk to individual the

as widely as possible the role of the counter terrorism police in fight not just terrorism but the state threat that be appear before we the reality be we do not expect war today to take its old

letter about an individual who have be threaten his neighbour have be offer bounty if they hand he in to the chinese embassy ask how much long will we keep on say all these wonderful word in this house about what we stand for because when it come to those who need our protection nothing ever seem to happen what will the minister do about the embassy wherever china have super embassy in the

transnational repression for the sake of clarity can say to she that any attempt by any foreign government to coerce intimidate harass or harm critic overseas which undermine our democracy and the rule of law be completely unacceptable we have at our disposal now the national security act which enable law enforcement and the security and intelligence agency to deter detect and disrupt the full range of modern day state threat include action that amount to transnational repression as say the defend democracy taskforce be look very carefully at the issue of transnational repression there have be lot of work take place across government and we will have more to say about it shortly birmingham have large and grow community of people from hong kong although most be now well settle in the wide

chinese operative on our shore have to stop no step take thus far have deter the chinese from overstep the mark on our shore if those who legally and peacefully oppose china be not safe here just where be they safe put bounty on people head sound like something from film but this be real life for those live lawfully in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland right now what will the minister do to tell china that the line have be cross and that there will be consequence be grateful as always be to the hon member he have long stand track record of stand up for repressed minority wherever they might be clearly that be particularly relevant in the context of today urgent question he will have hear my opening remark in which refer to the statement that have be issue by the foreign secretary specifically condemn the bounty and in which he call on beijing to repeal its national security law include its territorial reach we take these matter incredibly seriously we be work with the police and local community and will do everything we can to make sure that people get the support that they deserve want to come back to the embassy have be contact by several constituent on this matter at square foot it would be china large embassy in europe as we know from the incident at the manchester consulate in such an embassy would be contribute to the transnational repression that hongkongers tibetans and the wide chinese diaspora in the uk experience have the government make an assessment of whether this new super embassy would contribute to transnational repression and if so on what basis have that assessment be make my hon friend question have be ask by other assure he that national security be the override priority for this and hope any government we look incredibly carefully at these matter we will consider every aspect of this application which ultimately be to be decide on by the deputy prime minister but as have say both the home secretary and the foreign secretary have write very clear letter invite those member who appear not necessarily to have read it to do so and can tell he and the house that the letter cover the full breadth of national security issue in relation to this planning application the minister be talk about the national security position in relation to the super embassy in january the foreign secretary and the home secretary write letter about the application to the deputy prime minister who have to make the decision in the light of the new information that have become available will the minister review that letter and take advice on whether the foreign secretary and the home secretary should be write to the deputy prime minister to recommend that the planning application be refuse rather than take all these thing into account understand the concern that the hon member have raise he will understand that have already refer to the letter that be write back in january if new evidence come to light that be material to the planning application no doubt that will be look at very closely both by the home secretary and the foreign secretary but can assure he and the house that we take these matter incredibly seriously and look very closely at they the letter that be write on january do consider the full breadth of national security implication draw the house attention to my role as chair of the all party parliamentary group on hong kong welcome the minister recognition that the bounty on the head of these british hongkongers be for exercise right guarantee to they under the joint declaration do not wish to repeat what other right hon and hon member have say but at some point when minister come to the house again and again to talk about the infiltration of the royal family by chinese agent the putting of bounty on people head or secret police station there have to be consequence for the relationship with china have practical question the fear feel by those who have bounty on their head here be nothing compare with those who remain in hong kong who fear that they may not be able to leave what practical assistance can we give to hongkongers who have have either their bno passport seize or other travel document frozen so that they be able to come to the safety of the united kingdom be grateful to my hon friend for his work through the appg and his long stand interest in this particular matter and for his practical question bno status holder and their family be make significant contribution to our economy and local community he ask an important question about passport can assure he that there be no requirement for person passport to be valid in order for they to apply to extend leave or for indefinite leave to remain under the bno route know that colleague in the foreign office will have hear his point about those who remain in hong kong but would be happy to discuss it far with he should that be helpful intimidate pro democracy hongkongers live in the uk place they on wanted list and circulate reward notice to their neighbour be simply unforgiveable be sure that the minister will agree that no trade deal be worth subvert our value and allow the right of our people to be abuse in such an appalling fashion what discussion have his department have directly with the chinese ambassador what have the ambassador be tell the consequence will be for those find to be responsible what be the status of the current investigation or do everybody just accept that this matter be now close understand why the hon gentleman raise these concern in the way that he do hope that he will be reassure that the uk government especially the foreign secretary and the home secretary take these matter seriously and take every opportunity to raise these concern at the appropriate level we will continue to do everything that we can to protect the public in our country at the recent lunar new year celebration meet democracy activist who have have bounty place on they the fear in the room be palpable people choose not to attend the event so that they would not be photograph with people who have bounty on their head fear that that chilling effect be already very real thank the minister for confirm that transnational repression be be look at by the defend democracy taskforce but could he give we bit more detail on the practical measure that can be put in place now to well protect those in the uk with bounty on their head and their family member still in hong kong for whom they be deeply concerned give the possible knock on effect for they completely understand my hon friend point about the fear feel and the chilling effect that be certain there will be in number of community he have ask for practical measure gently ask he to be little patient because will have more to say about these matter very soon government and opposition members have ask the minister several time whether the chinese ambassador have be summon to be hold to account for these action this house deserve an answer from the minister lot of these people face kidnap plot what investigation be be undertake into those the right hon gentleman will know from his time in government that in the first instance these matter will relate to the ambassador in the foreign commonwealth and development office can give he the same assurance that previously give the uk government take these matter incredibly seriously and raise they at every opportunity he ask about investigation the police be work incredibly hard alongside operational partner and will investigate all these matter use the appropriate resource in order to bring perpetrator to justice and ensure that victim be provide with the support that they need and deserve today speak with chloe cheung the young person to be sanction under the national security law know that she will be pleased to have be at least reference by member on both side of the house chloe convey to the anxiety and concern of the leeds hong kong community which be not new to give the conversation that have be have with that community who form substantial part of my constituency understand that the minister can not comment on specific case so have two general question first can the government give cast iron guarantee that any future trade deal with china will not compromise the protection that we have offer hongkonger live in the uk my second question be about will the government consider facilitate meeting between and those hongkongers who have have bounty put on their head as result of the national security law to ensure that robust protection be in place for those who have be sanction my hon friend be an assiduous constituency mp he have raise the plight of his constituent previously in this house and be grateful to he for do so on his first point national security be the first priority of this government his second point be probably more matter for counter terrorism police and west yorkshire police but have hear what he say and will take it away and come back to he with full response thank the shadow home secretary for secure the urgent question be lucky enough to represent in my constituency one of the large hong kong community and they tell that the propose chinese super embassy be chilling prospect for hongkongers who have move to our country to escape repression in hong kong as we all understand the decision be with the deputy prime minister at the moment but surely the minister agree that it be unconscionable that foreign state should be allow to massively enhance its operation in this country while it flagrantly conduct extrajudicial act on the street of the uk do he agree that if permission be give it would undermine any assurance give that foreign state will be hold to account for hostile action target british resident on british soil give the hon member strong constituency interest completely understand why he raise those concern hope that he and other hon member will understand that from national security perspective we take these matter incredibly seriously there be limit to what can say about the specific of this case but let put this in slightly more diplomatic way than might normally seek to there seem to be something of misunderstanding about the circumstance of this case give the hon member an absolute assurance that we look incredibly carefully at these matter and some of the suggestion that have be make be not correct process be under way and be legally bind not to interfere with it no hon member would expect to do so but point he again to the very carefully consider letter write by the home secretary and the foreign secretary which include reference to the full breadth of national security issue to do with this application my hon friend will know that the joint committee on human rights be conduct an inquiry on the important issue of transnational repression will he commit to look very carefully at any recommendation that come from that inquiry so we can ensure that we have the correct measure in place to uphold the fundamental british value of democracy here in the uk and of course safeguard our national security know about the joint committee on human rights inquiry in fact believe that be due to give evidence to it can absolutely give my hon friend an assurance that we will look carefully at the finding of that important piece of work have write to the committee chair about it and look forward to meet the committee and give evidence look forward to progress the work through the defend democracy taskforce so that we can say more about the work against transnational repression that the government intend to do recently meet jimmy lai son sebastien and his legal team and be horrified to hear that his uk legal team from doughty street chambers recently face concerted and co ordinate campaign against they include intimidation surveillance hack of bank account and rape threat aim at their child it appear that the chinese state be now undermine our legal system the minister have repeat at the dispatch box that the government will take all step to prevent persecution of hong kong national in the uk will he support the call from and my hon friend the member for bicester and woodstock calum miller for high profile visit by uk and chinese official in our respective country to be pause until the security situation be resolve be grateful to the hon member for raise the case of jimmy lai too have meet sebastien lai jimmy lai case be priority for the government and we have make that clear in our engagement with china we call on the hong kong authority to end their politically motivated prosecution and immediately release jimmy lai the prime minister raise his case with president xi at the summit in november the foreign secretary raise it with china foreign minister in october and the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west raise it with hong kong official during her visit to hong kong in november iranian state threats with your permission madam deputy speaker will make statement on the grow threat to the uk from iran and the step that the government be take to combat this threat hon member welcome back it be pleasure to be back the threat from iran sit in the wide context of the grow diversify and evolve threat that the uk face from malign activity by number of state the threat from state have become increasingly interconnect in nature the line be blur between domestic and international online and offline and state and their proxy in the last year the number of state threat investigation run by jump by that statistic be stark indication of the increase threat turn to iran the regime have become increasingly emboldened and be assert itself more aggressively to advance its objective and undermine our that be evidence by the fact that direct action against uk target have substantially increase over recent year the director general of recently state that since the start of the uk have respond to iran back plot present potentially lethal threat to british citizen and uk resident the iranian regime be target dissident and medium organisation and journalist report on the regime violent oppression it be also no secret that there be long stand pattern of the iranian intelligence service target jewish and israeli people internationally it be clear that these plot be conscious strategy of the iranian regime to stifle criticism through intimidation and fear these threat be unacceptable they must and will be defend against at every turn it be testament to our world lead law enforcement and intelligence service that through their tireless commitment so many plot have be thwart be sure that the whole house will join in pay tribute to the brave man and woman of our law enforcement and intelligence agency who work day in day out to keep we safe to tackle this threat we must understand it the iranian intelligence service which include the islamic revolutionary guard corps and the ministry of intelligence and security direct this damaging activity but often rather than work directly on uk shore they use criminal proxy to do their bidding that help to obfuscate their involvement while they be safely ensconce in tehran we see that in intelligence but we also see it publicly in the conviction of the chechen bear austrian national who be imprison for conduct surveillance on iran international uk headquarters these threat be not only physical in nature the national cyber security centre have see malicious cyber activity conduct by actor who be affiliate with the iranian state that target range of state sector include in the uk the government be absolutely committed to ensure that our intelligence and law enforcement agency have the tool that they need to disrupt and degrade the threat that we face from iran so can announce today that we will place the whole of the iranian state include iran intelligence service the irgc and mois on the enhance tier of the new foreign influence registration scheme the firs be critical disruptive tool for the uk this action will mean that those who be direct by iran to conduct activity in the uk such as criminal proxy must register that activity whatever it be or face five year in prison they will face choice expose their action to the government or face jail the home office will lay regulation before parliament as soon as possible with view to have the scheme up and run by the summer on proscription as hon member will know we do not routinely comment on group that be be consider for proscription but assure the house that we do and will continue to keep the list of group consider under constant review however it have become increasingly clear that there be challenge inherent in apply our exist counter terror legislation to state and state link threat to our national security that challenge be first raise by the home secretary in opposition she warn of lack of comprehensive strategic approach for state threat to mirror that adopt on terrorism and the specific difficulty of use on state body proscription mechanism that be design for group such as al qaeda we be progress work at pace to address that challenge so can announce today that jonathan hall kc have be ask to review the part of our counter terrorism framework that could be apply to modern day state threat such as those from iran that include give specific consideration to the design of proscription mechanism for state and state link body provide more flexibility than be offer under the exist power as the independent reviewer of both state threat legislation and terrorism legislation mr hall be perfectly place to undertake the review and we be grateful to he for agree to provide that advice let there be no doubt we be utterly determined to stay ahead of those who threaten our country and any step that could aid we in that critical endeavour will be consider the uk be not alone in face such threat state across the western world be threaten by iran so we will work with our ally to well understand expose and condemn iranian action and bring iranian link criminal to justice wherever in the world they may be we regularly collaborate with our five eyes and european partner to protect our democracy from hostile iranian attack here at home we be go far too the national security act which be support on both side of the house have give the police new power to target evolve activity for example the act criminalise assist foreign intelligence service such as the irgc or mois the maximum penalty for those offence be year in prison which be the same as the maximum for proscription offence can also announce that training and guidance on state threat activity be now be offer by counter terrorism police to all territorial police force across the uk that will mean that when any frontline officer encounter suspect state threat incident they will know what to do and what to look for to ensure that our community be keep safe furthermore we have recently issue guidance on the national security act and how it apply to the uk security profession include private investigator that ensure that they be aware of the law and understand where they might be criminally liable if they be work for any foreign power such as iran we will also continue to go after the criminal network and enabler that iran use to carry out its work the leader of the zindashti organised crime group group frequently use by the iranian regime have already be sanction we will explore further sanction against other iranian link criminal and the national crime agency will target those who assist the irgc and other to launder their money alongside the recently launch border security command which strengthen britain border security and disrupt criminal smuggling gang have ask official to consider new way to enforce our robust immigration rule to specifically address threat from iran that work will focus on far protect the uk from iranian infiltration include those who promote iranian interference in the uk be clear that our response must be uk wide effort so welcome the charity commission statutory inquiry into both the islamic centre of england and the al tawheed charitable trust have also ask official to review where any iranian interference be be conduct in the uk and firs will shine more light on any undisclosed relationship between the iranian state and uk base institution and individual finally the national protective security authority and counter terrorism policing will continue to provide protective security advice and support to individual and organisation threaten by the iranian regime and its criminal proxy include persian language medium organisation and their employee we will also continue to maintain funding for protective security measure to synagogue jewish community centre and school ensure that we do all we can to keep our jewish community safe in dangerous volatile world britain must lead the way that mean proudly promote our value and strain every sinew to keep our people safe the measure have set out today should reassure the house and the public about our unflinche commitment to those objective under this government security will be the foundation on which everything else be build we will resist attack on our way of life as vigorously as we counter threat to life whatever their source we will work relentlessly to root out those intent on cause harm on our street and we will do whatever it take to protect our country and our democracy commend this statement to the house call the shadow home secretary thank the security minister once again for his courtesy in give advance sight of his statement the house should be in no doubt about how serious the threat pose by iran be iran sponsor terror organisation across the middle east it be an enthusiastic and significant supporter of hamas hezbollah and the houthis in yemen and it back militia in iraq and syria those organisation kidnap murder rape and commit terrorist atrocity without iran support those terror organisation would not be able to operate in the way that they do iran therefore bear heavy burden of responsibility for enable those terrorist actor to perpetrate atrocity let we not forget that iran be also an enthusiastic supporter of putin murderous regime and its invasion of ukraine iran supply drone technology to russia and more recently accord to the foreign secretary have supply ballistic missile to russia which be be use in furtherance of their illegal and barbaric invasion there be no question that iran be hostile state it promote terrorism undermine freedom and undermine democracy we have recently see action by iran on british soil and journalist be harass to the point that one medium organisation have to relocate its activity thankfully only temporarily from london to new york that be completely unacceptable we of course support the government in the listing of iran in the enhance tier of firs and we will support the relevant statutory instrument when it come before parliament be glad that the national security act be be use and pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for tonbridge tom tugendhat see he be in his place for his work in put that act on the statute book have welcome this move have some question however which be essentially in this vein be merely require registration strong enough sanction put it to the house that it be not because under firs all that be require be registration and that alone be not enough we see our ally the united states in designate the irgc as terror organisation we see our canadian ally do the same just last year yet have hear nothing on proscription the minister say they do not comment on proscription but the home secretary do comment on it in january when in opposition and in unequivocal term the irgc be behave like terror organisation and must be prescribe as such she then say in april that she would like to make change to the legal architecture yet it be only today that the security minister have announce the review by jonathan hall why have it take seven month to initiate review which the now home secretary talk about nearly year ago then we come to the view of jonathan hall himself because he say coincidentally also in april that the national security act be good enough for the purpose of deal with iran my question to the security minister be this who be right be it the home secretary who in call for outright proscription be it the home secretary who in call for change in the law about which nothing appear to have be do until today or be it jonathan hall who say also in april that the national security act be sufficient there be some confusion about the government position which seem to have move over time so clarification on that would be welcome why be the home secretary not introduce outright proscription as she say she would do in more need to be do to counter the threat pose by iran on our shore the security minister hint at this towards the end of his statement for example be there more diplomat that we could expel who might be undertake espionage activity or direct some of the activity on british soil see that the minister for policing fire and crime prevention my successor as policing minister the right hon member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson be in her place be there more that the police could do to investigate this activity be we do enough to provide protective security to potential victim of this activity it be in my view completely unacceptable that the independent iranian dissident medium group have to move temporarily to new york we should make sure that no one have to move again as result of these threat and be we use sanction enough the security minister mention this in his statement but should we be use more sanction against individual in the iranian regime and organisation that be part of the iranian security apparatus think we should and we should certainly be use the lever at the home office disposal such as visa sanction that be to say not issue entry visa to people we suspect of be complicit in these activity or deny visa to high rank or other well connect iranian official to act as deterrent the security minister talk about the wide context of hostile state threat he say in the previous urgent question that he would address in this statement the question of whether china should be place in the enhance firs tier indicate dissent well he say he would address it and eagle eyed member will notice that he do not address it so will ask he the question directly now and there will be no avoidance because there be no further statement will he place china in the enhance tier of firs will he please confirm that to the house because think all of we would support he if he do be grateful to the shadow home secretary for the point he have raise which will endeavour to work through first let agree with his characterisation of the iranian regime hope there be no disagreement among we about that which be precisely why it be right that we proceed with the measure have describe today he be right to mention the national security act landmark piece of legislation pay tribute to all those who be involve in it include my predecessor the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat it be an incredibly useful tool that be already deliver and make significant contribution to our national security it be mechanism that we will continue to use and also to build on perhaps the shadow home secretary will forgive if suggest that he be seek to make bit of mischief over the issue of proscription heaven forbid he will understand because this be the case when he be minister in the department that government do not comment on organisation or entity that be be consider for proscription he know that be long stand protocol and will understand very well the reason for it he would not expect to break from that long stand precedent today and be not go to the right hon gentleman refer to comment make previously by the home secretary the home secretary when in opposition absolutely rightly identify the challenge that we be now seek to address in government know that there be huge respect for mr hall clearly he be independent of the government and supremely well qualified he be credible and authoritative figure who be perfectly place to look at the legislative framework and give advice independently to the home secretary about how good to proceed give our concern that the architecture that be in place be well gear towards terrorist entity an organisation such as al qaeda for example than to state back entity think that be entirely the right way to proceed we will obviously look very closely at mr hall finding be very happy to discuss they far with the shadow home secretary and other and of course we will give further update to the house as soon as possible the right hon gentleman entirely reasonably ask what more could be do again as former home office minister he will completely understand that there be lot of thing that we be do that we be not go to talk about and he will understand the reason for that but can give he the assurance that we be do everything we possibly can to combat the threat that we all know we face the right hon gentleman also make an important point about protective security again we take that matter very seriously it have be test on numerous occasion in recent year he will understand that the home office work closely with other government departments as well as with the relevant agency and law enforcement to ensure that we be provide the proper protection for those individual who have be identify as at risk and that the police and the security service work tirelessly to investigate those threat and to take other step to ensure the safety of those concern tailor protective advice be offer to those individual consider to face specific threat and where necessary more extensive security option can be put into effect finally the shadow home secretary again slightly mischievously seek to infer that have make commitment in my previous response but that be not quite the case he will understand that announcement about firs will be make in this house today announcement specifically relate to the decision that we have take on iran it be specifically about that country and other announcement that be make with regard to firs will be make in due course be extremely grateful to the minister for his statement and also for his unwavering commitment to address the threat pose by the iranian regime here in the uk particularly to our jewish community have hear evidence of the irgc operate on british campus seek to radicalise our student operate charity to pursue its malign aim and plot to murder people on britain street can the minister reassure the house that the review of proscription and state threat will be expedite and that he will do whatever be necessary to protect britain from this grow threat know that my hon friend have long stand interest in these matter and can give he the assurance that he seek completely agree that the kind of disruption and interference that he have describe whether that be in university on student or through charity be completely and utterly unacceptable he specifically ask about the review of state threat that the home secretary have commission mr hall to undertake he will understand as will other member that mr hall be extremely efficient and well organise he understand the importance of this work and he be get on with it at pace we be keen to work with he and make sure that he have all the support that he require and anticipate that he will be able to complete that work quickly call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for give advance sight of his statement the liberal democrats of course welcome the step he have outline and recognise the existential threat that iran now pose not only to israel but to western democracy include here in the uk last year the head of ken mccallum lay bare this very serious threat iran and other nation such as russia intensify their effort to interfere in all aspect of british life include the plot back by the emboldened iranian government as he describe they that have identify in the past three year of course we welcome the placing of the whole iranian state on the firs enhance tier and that will include iran revolutionary guard which be vital part of the infrastructure that make iran government such threat act as it do with impunity supply terrorist group such as hezbollah and contribute so much to the tension and violence across the middle east if we be to achieve last peace it be also essential to curtail the influence and threat of iran to the west we welcome the review by mr hall that have be outline be glad to hear that the government continue to keep the list of proscribe group under review but hope that decision on the irgc will come soon rather than later would like to hear how we will strengthen sanction regime to start tackle the influence of iran the measure announce today be welcome start but we stand ready to support sanction and hope the government will go far and fast be pleased to see the government work closely with territorial police force across the united kingdom to give officer at all level the skill and confidence to identify these threat on our own shore particularly those to community that remain vulnerable so also welcome the reference to the threat face by our jewish community across the country and the rise tension on our street hope the minister can outline how his department will work with the community security trust and other group to keep all jewish community safe at time when those abroad seek to undermine our whole country we must not let they succeed the hon member be absolutely right that we must not let they succeed and we will not she be also completely right about the existential nature of the threat the plot that she reference in the threat lecture by the director general of towards the end of last year illustrate the scale of the challenge be grateful for the hon lady support for the specific announcement today on firs and for her acknowledgment of the work that we seek to do with mr hall in look carefully at the legislative framework we keep matter relate to proscription under constant review she be right to mention sanction can assure she that we work incredibly closely with partner in the foreign commonwealth and development office be grateful as know other member will be for the hon lady reference to the importance of ensure that we work cross party to protect jewish community around the country she mention the community security trust it be an organisation that will be well know to member across this house it be incredibly professional and deliver massive value to community right around the country and we will continue to work closely with it just want to make one further reference speak early about the landmark nature of the national security act it be measure for which we be truly grateful also want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the contribution make by the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds in introduce that landmark piece of legislation it be not forget thank the minister for his statement and welcome the action that this government be take to counter the malign influence of iran on britain street give the wide range of threat from hostile state actor include iran it be vital that we take effective action to protect critical national infrastructure from cyber attack will the minister update we on plan announce in the king speech last year for new bill on cyber resilience and on the other action be take to improve our protection in this area my hon friend raise an important threat vector that be not often comment on can tell he that the national cyber security centre assess that iran be an aggressive and capable cyber actor with number of powerful disruptive and destructive tool at its disposal as he will understand the ncsc continue to work closely with government industry and international partner to mitigate the cyber threat from iran it be something that we take seriously and that we be work across government to counter do the minister agree that this be at least one area where our co operation with the united states can continue on the basis of common mutual interest give president trump extremely strong attitude to the abuse carry out by the iranian regime be the minister aware think he probably be that during the previous parliament the intelligence and security committee complete the classified version of major report on iran and all its activity do he look forward like to the redaction process be complete soon so that we can all benefit from the finding of that report be grateful as always to the right hon gentleman because he always add significant amount of wisdom to proceeding and appreciate it agree about the importance of our relationship with the united states and that we absolutely have mutual

committee to ensure that we can collectively derive the benefit of the report be grateful to he and previous member for the work they have do thank the minister for his reference to money laundering he will know full well the extent to which iran use illicit financial network to evade sanction and to fund hostile activity will the minister update we on what the government be do to follow the money and disrupt those money laundering network particularly those use by proxy and enabler in the uk be grateful to my hon friend for his question and the important work that he do through the all party parliamentary group he be absolutely right that illicit finance fund hostile activity and this government take it incredibly seriously that be why we have appoint baroness hodge as the anti corruption champion and we be in the process of produce an anti corruption strategy which the government intend to publish before the summer recess that be also why recently visit the united arab emirates because the nature of this particular challenge require an international response it be why the uk seek to work with our international partner to do everything we can to tighten the screw on those who would seek to use illicit finance to fund terrorist activity it be priority for the government we be grateful for the support and work that he do and for the work that baroness hodge do and we will continue it at pace pay tribute to the minister for the work he be do on lead this fight against hostile state that be do so much against we join he in pay tribute not just to jonathan hall he do amazingly good work for we in government and be sure will be serve the minister with the same dedication and diligence but to whose leadership under sir ken mccallum have begin to put real focus on some area that have previously slip by do the minister agree that this be not just domestic challenge recognise all that he have set out but we need to be work on this matter with friend and ally the pressure that we see in iran today the failure of the state the emergence of civil society and perhaps even let we hope the destruction of that dreadful regime that have occupy the country and torture those people for so many year require whole of government response we be feel the effect here in the united kingdom because the poison be seep out of tehran be grateful to the right hon gentleman for the work he have do previously and for the support he have provide completely agree with what he say about jonathan hall jonathan hall be figure of great integrity and authority we be lucky to have he

region we be progress that work with colleague in the foreign office and as the right hon gentleman know he reflect on the prime minister statement yesterday the prime minister personally take it very seriously these be the most profoundly important matter we take they incredibly seriously and we be work across government and with our partner to address they welcome the action that the minister be take to combat iranian state threat on our street he say in his statement that there be long stand pattern of target jewish and israeli people by the iranian intelligence service although that be certainly no secret it be still very concern for the community involve absolutely welcome what he say about maintain funding for protective security measure around synagogue community centre and school but give the seriousness of the situation will he set out in more detail how the government will protect the jewish community in the uk from those and other threat my hon friend make an important point that concern will be share right across the house speak in my opening remark about the importance that we attach to ensure that all community in our country be not just safe but feel as if they be safe he be absolutely right to reference the importance of ensure that our jewish community feel that they be both properly value and properly protect he will have hear refer to the important work of the community security trust to which we have make significant financial commitment to support that work have write to the trust today and will meet it hope in the very near future it do extraordinary work and we be grateful for that be very happy to take this opportunity to reassure he and all member of our continue commitment to work with the trust in the future welcome what the security minister say about the inclusion of iran in the enhance tier of firs can he confirm hope that the isc will look at this that as that system operationalise it will also cover more complex situation in which it be not as straightforward as somebody take instruction from an organ of that state or from some other organisation include under firs or indeed situation in which there be no actual instruction or relationship at all but somebody choose to act on that organ behalf be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his previous work he make an important point and can absolutely give he the assurance that he seek we will have much more to say about that in future but hope he recognise that today mark significant step forward this measure be introduce by the previous government and we think that it be the right way to proceed and be seek to progress it at pace welcome the minister statement be confident that he will agree that this house the government and the country bear no animosity towards the iranian people and that it be the action of the iranian state that we be deeply concerned about and take action on in that regard will he give more detail on the training available for police officer who must often counter the action of the iranian state on our street in constituency around the country my hon friend make two important point completely agree with his point about the iranian people this be not about they it be about the target activity of the iranian state we be absolutely clear that the measure we have announce today be specifically for those state entity not for the people of iran my hon friend also make an important point about police training confirm in my introductory remark that work by counter terrorism police with all our territorial police force right around the country be already under way it be absolutely essential that police officer on the beat wherever they may be have the training that they need to spot and more effectively understand the risk and threat that some of our citizen be subject to that be relatively new work it be be progress at pace be grateful to counter terrorism police and to police force right around the country for their commitment to it it have be privilege and an honour to engage with my many iranian constituent over the year but be always fill with horror when they tell story not only of what be happen to their family and friend back home in iran particularly the oppression still suffer by many woman but of their experience in this country very much welcome the measure that the minister have outline particularly in relation to police training which know will make big difference to my constituent one issue that those constituent often raise with and which be one of the big for british iranians live in this country be bank very much welcome the minister response to the hon member for kensington and bayswater joe powell on money laundering but british iranian resident who have be live here for many year often find that their bank account be frozen which leave they in considerable financial hardship some of those banking restriction be just impose without discrimination will reassurance can the minister give my constituent about their ability to continue bank without restriction be grateful to the hon lady for those point and for refer to our work to ensure that wherever they be in the country police officer have the requisite knowledge and experience to handle such matter when they encounter they she make good practical point about frozen account and banking arrangement for british iranians let take that away and come back to she she will recall that mention early the work be do through the defend democracy taskforce to review the issue of transnational oppression we be look carefully at what more we can do in that area will take away her point about banking for which be grateful it be welcome that the minister be take such strong action to counter the threat pose by iran on britain street but will he explain how the process to consider proscription style framework to tackle the irgc will work in opposition the now home secretary rightly do not think that the exist legislative architecture be necessarily appropriate that be the challenge of terrorist entity such as al qaeda and ensure that mechanism that might be use to proscribe state entity will work in the same effective way in order to seek advice the home secretary have commission jonathan hall to look carefully at that as my hon friend will have hear say mr hall be superbly qualified to do that work and be work at pace on it we will have more to say about it in the near future very much welcome the statement the minister be absolutely right to underscore the interconnected nature of the threat that we face from malign state actor which george bush call the axis of evil give recent event in the us the apparent distancing of washington from some of its ally and an alignment perhaps with president putin and note the strong connection between tehran and moscow do the minister share my concern that america may not have fully understand the connection between the two and what conversation will he and his colleague have with the us about the need for it to distance itself entirely and cauterise its relationship as far as that nexus between tehran and moscow be concern be grateful to the right hon gentleman as always be he always ask challenge question completely agree with his point about the interconnected nature of the threat he be absolutely right in his assessment he will understand as very experienced member of this house and former minister that need to choose my word incredibly carefully so will say that we place huge emphasis on the importance of the relationship with the united states that be why the prime minister be in washington recently to meet president trump the right hon gentleman will understand from his ministerial service the huge importance and value of the operational partnership that we have with the us in the wide context of the five eyes arrangement those be valuable linkage from which we benefit hugely as relatively new government we be still invest in those relationship to ensure that we get the most out of they we will work very closely with our new us ally to target what he rightly describe as the interconnect nature of the threat from country about which he know all about welcome the minister statement the israelis have do huge amount to dismantle iran influence in the middle east so will the minister ensure that we carry on give israel the support to ensure iran be not able to re establish that influence in some area through hezbollah and hamas will he also ensure that british company be not supply component to iran through series of country with which they can trade and that we be able to achieve our stated objective on that supply chain the right hon gentleman make important point he be right to attach importance to our relationship with partner in the middle east we invest heavily in those relationship and it be in our national interest to do so he make very good point about supply chain can give he an assurance on that but it be good point and will think far on it welcome the content and nature of the minister statement he say that he be consider new way to enforce robust immigration rule specifically to address threat from iran can he flesh out what that mean specifically on the government stance about proscription of the irgc know he be reluctant to talk about that but he may sense the frustration among right hon and hon member that zero context have be give and the government be stand behind veil of obscurity about how that might happen the minister speak appropriately about the protection that will quite rightly be afford to member of the jewish community in the united kingdom and previously in response to the urgent question he speak about the protection that will be afford by the uk state to hongkongers against foreign state actor act against their good interest will he tell the house what the uk state will do to protect iranians and persians live in the uk who be the subject of malign foreign state action against their interest be grateful to the hon gentleman there be quite lot in his question with regard to proscription hope have give he sense of the importance we attach to the work that the home secretary have commission it be entirely reasonable for the government to say that we have look at the exist legislative framework and decide that we need an independent reviewer and some independent advice to guide we about whether proscription be most appropriate for the state threat that we undoubtedly face think that be the right way to proceed hope he understand that no government would ever get into running commentary about proscription because that be not helpful and undermine the deterrent effect of that tool the hon gentleman make an important point about ensure that as government we do everything we possibly can to protect iranians who be currently reside in the uk can give he those assurance hopefully he hear my word early about the work the defend democracy taskforce be progress and about the transnational repression review which be an important piece of work the process have take some time but it should provide the mechanism by which government can most effectively ensure that people in this country be protect from the kind of threat that we have be discuss today know bear the minister incessantly with my repetitive call for the proscription of the irgc so welcome what he have to say today particularly about the independent adviser review which hope will be rapidly available for he to take action may pick up the issue raise by my right hon friend the member for south west wiltshire dr murrison about the need for whole of government response that do not mean just the foreign office as well as the home office it be wide than that could give the minister single example or number of example successive british government have stand aside while british university have do military research in conjunction with iranian researcher on battlefield armour range find laser drone and fighter jet will he ensure that the whole of whitehall bring the focus to this that be require the right hon gentleman have never bore sense madam deputy speaker that not everybody in the chamber would be able to say precisely those same word but can say they and look the right hon gentleman in the eye he be right to mention jonathan hall work he will know that jonathan hall be not an individual who sit on his hand he will work at pace we need to get move on with this and can give the right hon gentleman an assurance that we will and that work will progress at rapid pace the right hon gentleman point about wide government be exactly right there be an important role for the department for education the defend democracy taskforce that be set up by the previous government which now chair bring together virtually all the departments as well as number of other operational partner so that fulcrum point across government that look at these matter very much have that wide approach which he be right to raise thank the minister for his statement it be reassure that the government be not lose sight of all the other threat that face the united kingdom and our ally praise and endorse his comment about how our relationship with the united states be far deep and more integrate in defence and security go well beyond any disagreement we have with the present white house and will endure however warn he that while he have be speak president putin have make overture to the iranian regime to offer to broker talk between iran and president trump be it now time to draw to the united states attention the true nature of their new friend in moscow the hon gentleman speak with great wisdom on these matter simply say that completely agree with his analysis of the depth of the relationship with the united states the truth of the matter be that all our constituent be keep much safe because of the partnership arrangement we have with the united states and other five eye ally that be the most important security relationship we have and we need to invest in it for the long term can give he an assurance that that be what we will do warmly welcome the minister statement he will probably be aware that at the start of this year our close ally the united arab emirates proscribe organisation for their link to the irgc and iran and that eight of those organisation be headquarter in the uk will he give commitment to the house not to take action today but to review what have be decide by our ally and take action to prevent those organisation from carry out terrorist activity in the united kingdom be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise that important matter be in the united arab emirates on friday so be well verse on the point he make have respond to that issue in the house previously but give he an assurance that we will look closely at it and be happy to discuss it with he far thank the minister for his very diligent turn at the dispatch box this afternoon plan for neighbourhood with permission madam deputy speaker shall make statement about the government plan for neighbourhood the defining mission of this government be deliver economic growth and drive up living standard in that pursuit we be determined that nowhere be leave behind because as every member of this house will know when our economy have prosper in the past not everywhere have benefit over the past year decision take by the conservatives have see too many neighbourhood fall into decline with the most deprived area suffer more than other as we deliver our mandate for change the billion plan for neighbourhood mean that in place across the uk which for too long have be underestimate and undervalue this government will support the delivery of growth and access to opportunity and raise living standard because when our local neighbourhood thrive the rest of the country thrive too our new plan for neighbourhood mark the turning of the page on level up this government will not repeat the mistake of the past no more micromanage pot of money or pit community against one another to bid for they the truth be for all the promise about level up the tories instinct be to hoard power and hold our economy back some town be promise funding that do not exist with inflexible restriction on how that money could be spend our plan for neighbourhood stand in contrast with the conservatives unfunded and fail approach unlike the tories list of restrictive option for how town could spend funding we have double the policy activity that can be consider by neighbourhood board and put community at the heart of make these change the money will be spend on broadened set of intervention and have completely different objective align with the mission that the prime minister set out in our plan for change for example community can now spend funding on the thing that really matter to they such as the modernisation of social housing community lead housing skill support cohesion childcare and much more we be make good on commitment to deprive community give each of the place the certainty that they will receive up to million of funding and support over the next decade in many community work have already be undertake and we want to build on that rather than undo it that be why in each area we will support new neighbourhood board bring together resident local business and grassroots campaigner to draw up and implement new vision for their area for the first time that will include representative from social housing and workplace representative and in scotland wales and northern ireland the representative in the devolved legislature in consultation with its community each board will be give the freedom to decide how to spend the million year to deliver the priority of local people range from repair to pavement and high street to set up community grocer co operative or even neighbourhood watch these new broaden objective will give community the tool to make informed decision with list of intervention align with this government central mission those intervention have already be assess as demonstrate good value for money so they can be pursue without delay we have also publish toolkit outline the wide range power available to community and local authority in england with similar power for scotland wales and northern ireland to come follow consultation with the devolved government this be about give community autonomy and about people design and deliver the change that they want to see our new approach put community at the heart of delivery which be why we have introduce three new objective to guide the plan first there be the importance of build thrive place people take immense pride in their local area but too many of our high street and estate have be neglect and leave behind this funding can be use to ensure that town centre and neighbourhood well reflect the need of their community give resident say in how they be design it will deliver change that people can see and identify with so that at the end of this parliament people can look out from their doorstep and see well neighbourhood we also want the uk to be country with world class public service that work for everyone which be why this objective will support service that be accessible responsive and tailor to local need because invest in young people future and in preventive measure now will ease pressure on service over the long term the second aim be to build strong community we want to empower neighbourhood board to tackle the root cause of disengagement and division and to bring people together so that they can feel proud of their area and safe in their neighbourhood to restore collective sense of belong to their community that be about understand how division be not only an impediment to growth but barrier to drive up living standard our third aim be to empower people to take back control everybody should be in the drive seat of their own life and should feel in control of their future but that can feel like distant prospect when people be live from payslip to payslip stick on waiting list or just not listen to it be quite right that people want to have say over the future of their community with enough to get by and the opportunity to make the most of their life we want to make sure that child have the good start in life and that adult can live the life that they want will finish by talk about the inspiration for this programme which can be trace back through six decade of community politic we have draw enormously from john prescott and the noble baroness armstrong new deal for community which provide the stability of long term funding back by the support of central government like they our aspiration be to empower local people to drive the renewal of their neighbourhood and to deliver the transformational change that they want to see this announcement also have its origin in the community development policy of wilson and callaghan who draw the link between social deprivation and social division and now we be look to the future the prime minister have be clear that the task before we require decade of national renewal and our country have all the necessary raw ingredient untapped talent and potential across every town city village and estate but we also have people without enough to get by and place and public service that have be hollow out address that be the central driver of our plan for neighbourhood and that be just the start we have already begin to deliver real shift of power align with the deputy prime minister broad work on devolution make work pay fix the foundation of local government and build decent home but this be also down payment on what we know that community can achieve we will give people and place the resource and power that they need to succeed today announcement be response to anyone in these place who want to see change it send message that the full force of government will be there to help they to deliver it and that be why commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister much in this statement build on the work of the previous government and we share the new government ambition for the growth and renewal of our neighbourhood and high street which be so fundamental to our constituent quality of life as the minister know there be history behind this statement that link back to the desire of all our constituent to have proper say in the development of their home area in country that be as grossly centralise by democratic standard as the uk that local voice be vital eu cohesion fund which be the predecessor of the uk share prosperity fund be directly accountable to both the uk government and local representative in the short timeframe in which the previous government levelling up strategy be in effect it seek to bring to bear wide variety of national resource on exactly the challenge that the minister refer to in his statement there be billion fund allocate for regeneration and community the billion levelling up fund which be specifically design to support treasured asset such as pub and theatre where there be strong community support and the billion long term plan for tax we know that local leader welcome that investment and many member across the house speak very warmly of the benefit to their constituent so the challenge to the government today be to set out how this very small and limited project sit against that much broad levelling up ambition and in particular where it sit against the billion town fund set out under the previous government the house will acknowledge that this statement come at time when this government financial decision be bear down very heavily on our community the massive rise in national insurance contribution the increase in business rate on pub retail business and hospitality the change to business property relief and the multibillion pound funding gap that open up in council budget as result of the government budget last october all weigh very heavily in the balance against this modest announcement that leave aside the impact of the loss of thing such as the rural service grant and the community ownership fund which be specifically target at deliver support to community that need it while we welcome this rebadging and rehash of scheme that we progress when we be in office and its allocation to largely the same list of recipient we have some question to put to the minister the first be about the accountability of the propose neighbourhood board it be significant concern that the minister find time to say that the board will include trade union representative but not to mention the democratically elect representative of those local community trend that sit alongside the change in the propose planning white paper local democracy be vital if these board be to work effectively the second question be about the lack of clear purpose for these resource while it sound like positive thing to broaden the range of area in which they can be spend it be serious concern that the government again choose refurbishment and modernisation of social housing which be already allocate for in other area of local government funding it beg the question of whether these fund will in fact go towards make up shortfall that the budget create in other area of government spending finally there be real concern that broaden the criterion and choose to use generalised national statistic rather than local understanding of need to decide how to allocate funding will mean that the resource be allocate in way that simply do not reflect need and local circumstance bidding process allow local authority which lead and represent their area and can identify particular need to come forward to government and present plan the process of allocation that be be suggest create serious risk that those who can do the most to regenerate and benefit our high street and community will lose out in favour of those who be simply able to meet the criterion of whitehall box tick be grateful to the opposition spokesperson for those question he be right to say that this plan build on the previous long term plan for town commitment which be why we think it prudent to retain the same recipient area that promise have be make and it should be keep however when enter the department on my first day in government and talk to civil servant it be astonishing to find out that the programme billion commitment make by the previous government be unfunded it be fund through reserve that have be spend three time over that be simply no way to run country be very pleased that we have be able to keep that commitment to those community because goodness know there would have be disappointment have we not the hon gentleman talk about the plan place in the wide environment of course we commit to the transition year of share prosperity funding in the budget we be now in spending review period and as say in my statement we be commit to get community the tool and resource that they need in order to shape place to respond to the hon gentleman question on accountability of course local councillor be still involved we be talk about change to broaden neighbourhood board we want local councillor to be involve we would like local member of parliament to be involve and in the area where they exist we would like devolve representative to be involve however we think that the voice of people who work in the community be also valuable and be surprised that the hon gentleman do not the hon gentleman talk about lack of clear purpose think this be where we be in different space because believe in freedom to make decision locally believe that expertise be hold locally the wisdom about community across this country be hold by the local community rather than the minister that might perhaps be revelatory for minister to say believe that change community whether through what we call local growth level up or any of the other thing that it have be call over the past year be an inside job well do by local community and that my role as minister and our role as government be to get community the tool and resource that they need we differ on that point even the previous government move away from their affection for the bidding process by the end of the last parliament they understand that it do not work that debilitate beauty parade that pit community against each other be not very good way of get money to those community however another point of difference be that believe in long term allocative settlement that be more flexible and guide by people locally whereas the opposition believe in short term bidding and central prescription value for money believe that the good value for money be when community have the tool and resource to shape place themselves accord to their criterion rather than mine that be how we drive change call the chair of the select committee thank the minister for the statement number of member have be on council and some of we still serve on they if we be all honest the unfortunate reality be that the competitive tendering process do pit some council against each other include deprive council it be right that we move away from that and away from the sticking plaster politic that we have see over the past few year want to press the minister to give we bit more of an understanding of how the neighbourhood board will be set up and how they will function will there be clear recruitment process to get the local buy in that be critical as the minister say it be important that we bring community along with we if there be conflict between local authority and the board for example over regeneration plan will one have the power to veto the other and will the department have oversight so that it can intervene should there be serious concern about intervention and operation the minister say that it be important for community to have say in their future so be the department look at the community right to buy declare my interest as labour and co operative mp through the community right to buy we have see local pub library leisure centre and so much more saved when can we expect to see that new light and when will that legislation come forward be grateful to the chair of the select committee for those question agree with what she say about competitive tendering the quid pro quo be that the government of the day have to be very clear about how allocation be make my commitment be that we will always be very transparent about how the decision be make and know that the select committee will take strong interest in that turn to the establishment of board suspect that one of the theme of discussion over the next few minute will be our not want to hold back area that be make great progress area with establish board may take advantage of the opportunity to add more people to those board and may move on at pace while other area may want to treat this moment as chance to reboot their board either way the basic principle be that the local authority will be the ring holder support by the local member of parliament but once that board have get go we expect it to be in leadership we do not want board to have significant tension with their council and we would expect any tension to be resolve in the usual way but those board will have the power to get on with the job the community right to buy be component of the white paper we be look forward to deliver the community right to buy because we know that it would be greatly value whether we be talk about buy pub or other building in community we be very keen on that and as fellow labour and co op mp be particularly keen on it call the liberal democrat spokesperson the liberal democrats welcome this plan to work with community to improve local amenity and engagement in the process we also welcome the move away from local council area bid against each other and towards more objective approach base for example on index of multiple deprivation in our opinion and my opinion the previous system divisively pit one area against another in way that do damage to more area than it help the liberal democrats be commit to allow community to take action to improve their area give sufficient power and resource local authority can play major role in respond to climate and nature emergency whether through the insulation of home enhance green space or improve air quality however the conservative government force council to do more and more with less and less plunge many into financial crisis as result council have go bankrupt around the country and many be feel the strain of cut to public service and lack of investment in community asset no community can flourish without proper power and resource so we welcome the plan commitment to ensure that new neighbourhood board work with local authority to implement new funding however we urge the government to confirm that local authority will be fund and resource substantially to take on this additional workload the financial burden on council have force many to make impossible choice on funding in my council of somerset for example nearly of council tax receipt go on care for vulnerable adult and child which many believe should be national responsibility until we have national solution to the care crisis council will continue to be hold back from reach their full potential we welcome the government commitment to invest in community lead improvement we also welcome the new neighbourhood board which should provide community engagement throughout the process we urge the government to reconsider their decision to remove district council level scrutiny from the planning process where whitehall take power and decision out of the hand of local councillor it also take decision out of the hand of local people that be undemocratic and will ultimately slow up the process of get the home that we need we also call on the government to confirm that nature and climate specialist will be include on the neighbourhood board finally can ask the minister order remind the hon member that there be time limit will give he one more sentence apology madam deputy speaker will the secretary of state review the list of town so that other can be include in future finally will the government consider roll the plan into neighbourhood plan so that they be give more statutory effect when planning decision be make be grateful for those question on the point about climate and nature gain consent from the community often start with buy in and localise climate intervention through these programme may well be good way to do that on the local authority point the budget be the first step in rebuild local authority finance which will take time as the hon member say resolution on social care will take some of the pressure off too on planning local plan be so important and not enough of the country be cover by they local people rightly want say and the good way to ensure that be through the local plan process on the town point the one that be previously announce be the one for which we have honour commitment but as he say there may be scope to go far in the future can not run ahead of the spending review but if we can prove that thing have work in these town there will be strong case to do they elsewhere thank the minister for his statement the previous government admit that they think that labour formula which provide money to deprived urban area need to be undo so welcome this government commitment to tackle deprivation which be much need as local authority area middlesbrough have the low wage in the region and some of the bad statistic for deprivation in the qualifying metric so it be regrettable that no community in my constituency of middlesbrough and thornaby east have qualify for the long term plan for town which be legacy of the predecessor government fail levelling up agenda fully understand the rationale in term of the parameter and population and the need to follow through on promise previously make but will the minister confirm the step that he be take to move on from the conservatives pork barrel politic and provide assurance that the government determination be to invest in the deprived urban area not serve in today announcement be grateful for the chance to reiterate that we want to honour the commitment make to those community because we feel that it be the decent thing to do our commitment which have give at the dispatch box previously be that in the future we will have allocative formula base on deprivation and need and we will go where the data say we should too often in the past ministers seek to go where the politic be but that do not serve those community or the country and we will do much well in the future the minister will understand that in the royal town of sutton coldfield we be delighted to receive the town fund money from the last government and we be grateful to he for in his word honour that commitment from the dispatch box may also thank he for the courtesy he have show in the discussion that he and have have about this as have say to he before hope that he will pay state visit to the royal town of sutton coldfield where we can show he not only the delight of the town but how well we will ensure that this taxpayer money be spend be grateful for that and for the conversation that have have with the right hon gentleman the difference between his area and the other be that in his case the connection be with town council rather than local authority as he know be great proponent of town and parish council he bear heavy weight as result but we want to demonstrate that this be model that work and could be use again in the future look forward to work with he and will of course pay that visit the two town in my constituency be delighted to be include on the list of town that will receive this long term funding such certainty have be absent from previous financial commitment but be particularly interested in the government arrangement for the future under the previous arrangement for town board deal decision have be make about put money into part of project that have be leave to suffer delay and incur extra cost in my case money that have be intend for the library be reallocate can my hon friend reassure my constituent that there will be an opportunity to review the government arrangement for the new neighbourhood board yes now be the time to review those board and we will be ask for that to be do by the end of next month there will then be time for the board to formulate plan over the next few month and to put in write how the money will be use to make that commitment to and contract with the local community hope that community become involved in those conversation indeed be sure that they will so that the plan reflect what local people want the minister refer to his support for parish and town council can he explain little more about the neighbourhood board will their geographical footprint be similar to that of parish and town council in the area concern if so would it not have be well to give this role to elect body such as parish and town council rather than to unelecte new board the elect body that will be the fundholder will be local authority as have say in only one case do the arrangement differ from those for the other council apart from parish and town council as for the boundary they reflect the human rather than the political geography there may or may not be point of alignment the good model will have local political as well as local community say think that that balance can be find but if there be concern about boundary now be very short moment in which that could be revisit there be not much flexibility to change the scope completely but if sensible tweak can be make we will of course have the necessary conversation it be welcome that today plan finally deliver on the unmet promise make to community through the last government long term plan for town but since the selection methodology in that plan be deliver pendleton in salford have sadly lose its only leisure centre and pool to fire which have leave community who be already starve of leisure facility with nothing at all will the minister meet to discuss what help the government can give salford to ensure that this vital facility be rebuild as matter of urgency be very sad to hear about the fire and will of course be happy to have that meeting the liberal democrats welcome the plan commitment to social housing and to ensure that development be community lead however it be disappointing that somerset will not feel the benefit give that demand for social housing in glastonbury and somerton and across the county vastly outweigh supply can the minister confirm whether there be plan to extend the plan to allocate further funding in addition to the local authority confirm today the hon lady know that can not run ahead of the spending review other fund be available include through the enhanced local government settlement and the share prosperity fund but if we can prove that this be an effective model there may be scope in the future to extend it for all the talk of level up from the conservatives gently remind they of my hasting and rye constituent experience of level up of taxpayer money be give to conservative donor to improve hastings town centre and all we have leave as result be board up shop really welcome the minister commitment of million for hastings which will be spend in responsible way base on the priority of my constituent whether that be break pavement broken bus shelter or buy back important community asset from pub to close concert venue know there be lot of concern in hastings about st mary in the castle can he explain how resident of hastings can feed into the process for how the money be spend be aware of the history that my hon friend mention hope that this will be reboot moment for hastings and chance to get some of the benefit that the community undoubtedly want to see the plan will be to get board in place quickly and then to develop neighbourhood plan exhort the board to engage with its community as well as possible and there be some brilliant example chesterfield and arbroath spring to mind and be sure those community will be generous in share their experience of how to do it well the minister and have very consensual exchange yesterday at question and he know that arbroath have be exceptional in this endeavour can he assure that where community have good structure those structure will be keep the funding be welcome but it be fair to say that there have be some disappointment in area such as perth and dunfermline there have also be some disappointment about the promise that be not keep by those who back our leave the eu on the lifeline funding that come from the european union can he give we some of his thought on how we match some of that up finally will he assure we that devolution will absolutely be respect in any plan go forward as say yesterday it be impossible in the church hall not to be strike by the extent of the consultation in arbroath which be model for elsewhere as the prime minister and the deputy prime minister have say we see devolution through the prism of want to reset our relationship with the devolved government have have those conversation as the hon gentleman may know and will continue to do so have representative of the devolve legislature involve in the board be positive step we do not want to hold back progress where area have make significant progress so they should move at pace believe that we will be able to make the relatively minor tweak that be need in their case and move forward at great pace with regard to previous structural fund we be able to deliver what we could in the budget and what be come forward will be look at as part of the spending review thank the minister for his statement and welcome the overall thrust of this important area of policy which put community at the heart of regeneration and investment have couple of question for the minister appreciate that reading have unfortunately miss out this time around and hope we be successful in the future could he explain how successful initiative such as high street action zone will be incorporate into this sort of work similarly how will the government incorporate asset of community value and other local matter that have help community to rebuild and re energise their area that be really important point the support provide previously be well mean but not very efficient what we have see over recent year be an accumulation of various different strand of level up funding which be less than the sum of its part one of the challenge be that we lose great insight so we will absolutely draw on the good initiative whether that be high street accelerator community ownership or funding asset of community value and share that insight with not just those win recipient but the rest of the country torbay be the premier resort in the united kingdom but behind our palm tree and victorian villa be the most deprived council in the west of england so it be truly welcome that torbay be one of these neighbourhood sadly we have have pregnant pause while the new government walk through the wreckage of the finance leave by the previous conservative government but it be very welcome that this money be come to bear it be also really hearten that it will be over number of year so we can have confidence about how to support our community however and my hon friend the member for eastbourne josh babarinde be particularly concerned about the result pregnant pause because we have oven ready opportunity for our community have already write to the minister on this issue but be it possible that after conversation with he we could pre spend rather than have even more month of delay in implement the change we all desperately want for our local community be grateful to the hon gentleman for his forbearance and for his consistent lobbying want to be very clear that the programme start from and that can not be bring forward local authority do have the flexibility to spend early understand that the money be come but that would of course be decision for they to take locally thank the minister and his department for today announcement and for the commitment to leigh in the plan for neighbourhood as he know leigh be home to some amazing community organisation and business that be work hard to improve our area but they have be do it alone for too long today cash boost for leigh change that do he agree that this plan mark the first step towards new partnership in which community be support and empower to shape the place they call home know of leigh great creativity not least at the spinners mill which my hon friend use to run from our perspective we want this to be reset of the way in which central government work with local community to unleash that creativity as have say think this be see by the opposition as revelatory but believe the people of leigh rather than should make decision about the future of leigh welcome the minister statement it be indeed very welcome in northern ireland where it affect coleraine and londonderry in my patch the year period be particularly welcome as it allow for planning and for proposal to be put in place can he assure we that towards the end of this parliament we will review the plan to see if it be possible to develop it and to become very focused on try to get benefit for our constituent yes this be really important point plan do take time to gear up and there may not be uniform spend of exactly million every year there may be some flexibility which be why think such length of time be valuable however after the fourth year we will do stocktake because we do not want place spin their wheel and build up huge backlog of funding plan have to be realistic so by the end of this parliament exactly as the hon member say we will have full stocktake be grateful to the minister for this very positive statement be naturally delighted that my home town of thetford in south west norfolk will receive share of this money it be really go to help unlock thetford potential but after year of so much decline what measure will be take to ensure that this money be spend as quickly as possible and make as much of difference as possible in the short term we will work closely with thetford and all the other recipient so that they have the good possible insight about what be effective and about some of the good practice elsewhere we have develop as part of the prospectus series of pre approve intervention so thetford could pick from among those know that they have already be assess as represent value for money such information and insight should be there to build really effective plan really quite quickly the plan for neighbour hood prospectus publish on the website early today talk about end the whitehall know good culture with that in mind would the minister look at the current allocation of capital and revenue and if that split need to be change in local area would he consider do that in his statement he say that this be about give community autonomy and about people design and deliver the change that they want to see be sure that all community in the uk would wish to have that autonomy so how could the principle of neighbourhood board be roll out even if the funding be not there to begin with absolutely we would want to see those board meet know from other area where they have anticipate and set up their board early that they have ask they to do other thing as well which think be really good sign of mature partnership on the revenue capital split be afraid there be no flexibility although that point be hear as part of the evaluation we will see what be effective but be afraid that what have be agree in the budget be what be agree commend my hon friend for today statement and wholly welcome the up to million for the town of coatbridge in my constituency be grateful to he for take the time last year to speak to about the former town fund coatbridge be earmark for levelling up funding but that be put at risk by the previous government announce the plan but cynically yet perhaps unsurprisingly fail to identify how they would fund they do my hon friend agree that by deliver this funding it be this government who be support regeneration in coatbridge put local people and local business at the heart of decision make to provide much need job and growth yes absolutely when my hon friend come to visit in my office feel that he and his colleague have come rather as wallet inspector and that be not go to get away with the shirt on my back have to be candid as say then really do not know whether we would be able to find the funding to deliver the programme which be why be overjoyed that we have those promise be make and need to be keep for the people of coatbridge and beyond rise to thank the minister for his commitment and his assurance today not least on behalf of the people of peterhead which be in my constituency the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis ask he about the geographical footprint of the new body want to press he on that because it be important to be clear whether there would be scope within the reorganisation of the board to extend their footprint be he able to comment on that please yes that be not an unfamiliar ask that colleague have make as have say we could not support boundary change that really change the nature of an area if we go up to population of million people it would cease to be the programme it be however if there be common sense change that could be make we will look at they very closely now would be very good moment for local authority and local mp to come forward with such an idea like the minister be proud to be labour and co operative mp today announcement be great win for our movement put power where it belong in our community in area such as mine community can be find in our proud grassroots sport team will the minister update we on what more can be do to empower fan to own and shape their local sport team we be very enthusiastic about fan ownership and we be through the fan lead review take forward many thing relate to football the community ownership fund have its final round just before christmas which in many case have sporting element to it the share prosperity fund through the local authority can support sport team we understand that sport team facility and field be huge part of local community we be committed to ensure that local community have control and the security of know that they will be there at the heart of their community welcome the minister statement and the vision that will truly transform community and constituency such as mine be make up that kirkby will get massive funding boost under the government plan knowsley be the second most deprived area in the country yet community across the constituency never stop work to improve their home centre in the heart of kirkby be vital youth and community hub that be open by my illustrious predecessor harold wilson who be mention in the minister statement invite the minister to meet to discuss how we could give knowsley more power and the funding and resource we need to shape the place that we call home absolutely support the point my hon friend make know the people of knowsley be very proud of the community that make up knowsley be very pleased to visit recently and to talk to my hon friend and her local authority which really have strong sense of local purpose would be very happy to have similar conversation about the plan to support kirkby and much more thank the minister for today statement and announcement which be incredibly welcome be most grateful not least because my constituency of west dunbartonshire and my home town of clydebank be set to receive up to million of funding meet the minister last year on this matter too can he confirm that clydebank will decide how good to use the funding to transform its town centre to ensure the investment have maximum transformational impact on my community and that this demonstrate that this uk labour government be deliver for west dunbartonshire and for scotland totally agree my hon friend have tell of the proud sense of identity in his community and the desire for the tool to enable they to shape their community which be what we be do through this programme know he will be proud champion of get resident voice into those local plan to ensure they be as effective as possible warmly welcome the minister announcement of the plan for neighbourhood which replace the unfunded promise leave by the previous government welcome in particular the fact that it give community far more agency to decide how the money be spend however be sure the minister will appreciate that other community across the country will have their nose press against the proverbial shop window include dartford where project such as the swanscombe pavilion be in dire need of funding to bring they back to life it have be great to discuss that particular project with the minister could he give an indication of how we might build on this great programme throughout the parliament to provide investment for critical project outside the designate place my hon friend succinctly express the strength of feeling from colleague today as say we be go into spending review phase which may be good moment for those conversation enjoy the conversation have with he on the swanscombe pavilion and will look to support he in whatever way we can to try to find solution for the final question call john slinger know that the list of area be the one the minister inherit he give truly brilliant statement which speak of strong community of pride in place and of the need for thrive community pay tribute to the minister for visit rugby where he do walk around and hold roundtable with and see that our labour borough councillor my colleague be work hard to achieve all those thing as well as vibrant community and business sector hope the minister will work with they so that they can learn some of the lesson from this absolutely superb plan for neighbourhood go forward greatly enjoy my visit to rugby it take more than an hour to realise that the great ovoid shape public art installation be rugby ball hence the rugby pun it be perhaps not my sharp day however really enjoy the session we have with local business and community and the local authority it be impossible not to come away with the sense that the community of rugby really have grip of where it want to go in the future as government and department our job be to give that community the tool and resource to make that reality housing estates motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision for right to manage for freeholder on unadopted private or mixed use housing estate to set minimum standard for public amenity on new housing estate to make provision about the enforcement of those standard to make provision about the adoption by local authority of public amenity on new housing estate and for connected purpose in perhaps less parliamentarily precise language but in word that might be bit more relatable for those watch at home the bill will make sure we be finally tackle the fleecehold stealth tax that be affect far too many new homeowner on new estate right across the country be incredibly proud to be here as member of party that recognise in some of the good tradition of this country the importance of secure home in which people can build stable and prosperous life indeed as labour mp be probably contractually obligate to remind the house that one of the defining mission of this labour government be to get britain build again when it come to the state of the housing market that we inherit it be clear that far too much simply be not work for far too many people that may be due to the following the broken state of the house supply system which price far too many people out of home ownership the lack of affordable social rent home or insecure private rent sector accommodation create precariousness for family who just should not have to face that in their life or the broken leasehold system on which we announce some really important measure yesterday that know many member across the house will have welcome today wish to address slightly less appreciated issue but one that be no less important fleecehold housing estate be really grow right across the country fleecehold arise when home be not adopt by local authority leave new occupant expose to fleecehold stealth taxis and pay money to private management company for service that other receive as part of their council tax they be on the hook to an estate management company which be often unaccountable to they and often seek to exploit they with every available power know from lot of conversation that have have with other member across the house that be far from alone in experience this issue it be grow in my constituency and also right across the country indeed when be away on holiday can not escape it either over recess be up in scotland visit my family family friend take to one side to raise the issue that they have have which be quite typical their estate have go unadopted for many year there be no end in sight to this situation in the meantime they be pay hundred of pound each year for basic service that the rest of their neighbour be receive through their council tax but that be not the bad of it when they miss one bill which have go up quite considerably at week notice rather than give they any tolerance their estate management company use the contractual power that it have to go straight to their mortgage lender to have the amount add to that family mortgage and to drive wreck ball through their credit score in the process this injustice can not be allow to persist but for far too many people this situation be become the norm there be once time when local authority would typically adopt housing estate when they come forward but that simply be no long the case indeed competition and markets authority report into this issue last year find that up to of new housing estate now go unadopted with no end in sight indeed many in my constituency have go unadopted for well over decade after completion in the meantime these householder be on the hook to private management company that they never expect to be stick with and for length of time that they have never consider the impact of that relationship have many facet first these householder be hit with what be in effect new home stealth tax they be often force to pay hundred of pound each year for service that every other homeowner would get as part of their council tax typically these bill be around but that be significant amount in cost of living crisis however the bill be far from limited to that have have correspondence from constituent who have be hit by bill run to thousand of pound again very short notice be often give for steep increase across the whole country in the cma find that more than million be spend by household on exactly these charge in that time give the growth that we know have happen and that need to continue to happen in our housing supply that amount will only have grow that can not be fair and it can not be justify part of the issue be not just the injustice of pay twice for something but the fact that this delivery mechanism be structurally design to maximise the cost that these household bear the management company be not directly accountable to the homeowner to the people to whom they be provide service there be no incentive for these management company to keep bill down indeed have have correspondence from people who have be charge upwards of just for have one lightbulb change on their estate moreover the small size of some of these estate or the extent to which they can be subdivide mean that the bulk of the high fee can often just cover management and professional service fee and bear no relation to any actual service deliver on the estate indeed one estate have be subdivide to such level that the vast majority of the bill that every household be pay be simply the fee for how they be audit each year that can not be right alongside that it be not just the cost that be the problem but the way that this be undercut the very nature of the stability and prosperity that home ownership be mean to bring with it by be on the hook to these management company resident often have to fight for year to get bare minimum work and service and response to their query they also often find that when they look to move away from this exploitative relationship they be unable to do so because of the risk create by that fleecehold system have speak to homeowner whose sale have fall through when crucial management pack information have not be provide by management company in timely way or who when they have look to move have not be able to because their credit score have be decimate by exploitative charge when they have not be able to pay steep increase in their service charge in what the management company view to be timely manner welcome the government commitment to try to do something about this but it be important that we address it at pace hopefully we will be build million home over the course of this parliament but those home will not deliver security or prosperity for the family who take they up if they trap they in fleecehold relationship and on fleecehold unadopted estate my bill look to take several important step forward to address this first it look to build on some of the recommendation in last year cma report to cut off unadopted estate at source mandate minimum adoptable standard that all developer would have to reach as part of their work and lay out minimum adoption timeline that local authority would be accountable for deliver on all that would ensure that unadopted estate limbo can finally be thing of the past give the perilous state of local authority finance be aware that this could create some financial burden however give certainty over the direction of travel in the adoption of estate and create clarity about the minimum standard for estate to be adopt would create the condition for local authority to be able to assess negotiate and condition through the planning process any value that they need to extract to ensure that they can cover the maintenance cost of that estate hopefully that will enable we to undercut that iniquitous persistence of two tier of council tax payer at source alongside that it be important that we do not walk by those who be already in these estate particularly because until we have solution they will only grow in number since they be now the default model for housing provision across this country the bill also look to build on amendment table by the then shadow housing minister my hon friend the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook in the last parliament to give freeholder on private estate the ability to enact right to manage this would put they back in the drive seat give they the power to fire unaccountable management company ensure that they have choice and drive up service level responsibility and hopefully the performance of those undertaking management work the bill be far from panacea many homeowner will want adoption to be the end state for their estate but it be an important step forward to drive down the ability of management company to be exploitative and extract unjustifiable fee from new homeowner it put they back in the drive seat and part of those adoption conversation hopefully to get their estate to where it need to be so that the inequity can finally end be so excited about this government housing mission and to see the number of people in my constituency and across the country whose life will be transform by our commitment to stable home however for long time now we have fail to appreciate the extent to which fleecehold become default model for new home delivery in this country be undercut the very sense of security and prosperity that new home ownership be mean to bring hope that the government will act with the pace that this issue deserve be very excited to introduce the bill today to start to tackle at source the root cause of the fleecehold stealth tax that be affect thousand of homeowner across the country who be pay million every year in unjustified service charge look forward to work with the government to do right by those affect right across the country question put and agree to order that alistair strathern

lord high commissioner bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time be pleased to open the debate on this bill which hope will have the house support it be simple straightforward and clear piece of legislation that seek to do one simple thing it will remove legal barrier that prevent catholics from hold the office of the lord high commissioner to the general assembly of the church of scotland this historic legal restriction apply only to catholics it do not apply to people of other faith or indeed of no religious faith for those hon member who be not familiar with the role of lord high commissioner if there be any perhaps it be beneficial for to set out some context the lord high commissioner be the sovereign personal representative to the general assembly of the church of scotland they be appoint as an observer to attend proceeding on behalf of his majesty the king the general assembly be the govern body of the church of scotland that meet each may in edinburgh to hear report make law and set the agenda for the church for the come year the ceremonial duty of the lord high commissioner include address the assembly at its opening and closing session as well as attend the daily business on the sovereign behalf in addition the lord high commissioner undertake official visit in scotland as well as host engagement at the palace of holyroodhouse historical legislation currently prevent the appointment of catholics to the role specifically the claim of right act set out restriction against catholics be appoint to public office in scotland include the role of lord high commissioner most of that be change by the roman catholic relief act which remove many aspect of religious discrimination towards catholics however it do not explicitly remove the restriction against catholics hold the office of lord high commissioner that mean that legislative restriction exist to this day against someone of the catholic faith be appoint to this office until now the issue do not arise because no catholic be ever appoint to the role but that position change in december with the announcement of the appointment of lady elish angiolini the bill will allow lady elish to take up the role there be similarity to the approach adopt in the lord chancellor tenure of office and discharge of ecclesiastical functions act which remove restriction on catholics take up the role of lord chancellor the bill be short as hon member can see and narrowly focus it will deliver small but important modernisation to allow catholics to undertake the role of lord high commissioner should declare an interest as member of the church of scotland and an elder of the kirk very much support the bill but the minister will be aware that the law society of scotland have suggest that it would have prefer consultation before the bill be introduce do he have any reflection on that think that its particular concern be about wide religious discrimination on the statute book that could have also be deal with as part of this process be grateful to the hon gentleman for his support for the bill will come on to the timetable that by necessity we have have to adopt legislation of this kind be not always precede by consultation some hon member may remember our late friend david cairns whose position in this house be facilitate by legislation remove barrier on ordain priest be elect to the house as understand it that particular piece of legislation do not have consultation before it either turn to lady elish angiolini whose appointment as the lord high commissioner for this year will be facilitate by the passage of the bill if it proceed lady elish have distinguished background in law justice and academia she be appoint dame commander of the order of the british empire for service to the administration of justice in in she be appoint by her late majesty the queen to the most ancient and most noble order of the thistle and in that role she participate in the coronation in lady elish have also be principal of st hugh college oxford since and be make pro vice chancellor of the university of oxford in the announcement lady elish appointment as lord high commissioner have be widely welcome in scotland the appointment would make she the first catholic to undertake the role of lord high commissioner and would be significant symbol of unity good will and collaboration between the church of scotland and the catholic church in scotland it build on the spirit of the st margaret declaration sign at dunfermline abbey in that be historic declaration of friendship between the church of scotland and the catholic church in scotland and the legislation before the house build on the spirit of that the hon member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont refer to the circumstance and the timetable say to the house that the bill be on an accelerated timetable which be necessary to ensure that lady elish appointment can be finalise ahead of the general assembly in may we hope to have all the parliamentary stage complete by the end of next month when subject to royal assent the formality of the appointment can begin that process will include formal commission for the office accompany by royal warrant and the speedy passage of the bill be to allow the formality necessary to enable lady elish to act as lord high commissioner and address the general assembly at its opening and closing session in may be the appointment not able to proceed that would be setback to recent progress and an outcome that do not believe anyone want therefore hope that the bill can proceed today with the support of all party in the house while the bill relate to the reserved matter of the crown have speak to the first minister of scotland and to representative of both the church of scotland and the catholic church in scotland about the bill and the desire to facilitate the appointment of lady elish thank they all for their constructive and collaborative approach have also have the pleasure of discuss the matter with lady elish directly and have no doubt that she will be an excellent lord high commissioner move on to the bill itself there be two clause clause make provision to allow person of the roman catholic faith to hold the office of the lord high commissioner to the general assembly of the church of scotland and clause set out the territorial extent of the bill and its commencement include that the bill will commence on royal assent it be small step to remove religious barrier without it neither lady elish nor any other catholic could take up the appointment by the sovereign the bill change that and ensure that the announce appointment can go ahead it be short and simple but still in its own way an important bill hope it will receive broad welcome and commend it to the house call the shadow minister it be pleasure to rise to speak in this debate in fact it be genuine pleasure to be speak as member of the church of scotland on an historically significant piece of legislation it could be argue that this be the late piece of the work that be begin with the passing of the very legislation that it seek in part to repeal the roman catholic relief act to ensure full equality for catholics in our public realm grow up not quite son of the manse it be three door down but very much in and around the kirk and in eight year as member of this place this be the first debate on any issue regard the governance or affair of the church of scotland that can remember give that it relate to one of the two establish church of our united kingdom that be on the one hand surprising especially when compare with the hour we spend debate governance and issue pertain to the anglican church but then its privileged status as the establish church in scotland underpin by the act of union and the protestant religion and presbyterian church act mean that since when the articles declaratory of the constitution of the church of scotland form part of the church of scotland act it have not require any uk or scottish parliamentary oversight regard church worship governance constitution membership or office bearer this make today an even more significant moment in the history of the church and the nation so infrequently be matter of the kirk discuss on the floor of either of scotland two parliaments our relationship between church and state in the united kingdom be brilliantly fashioned piece of british pragmatism or possibly fudge as some might describe it only in great britain could we have head of state who while be supreme governor of one establish church the anglican church of england be also an ordinary member of completely separate presbyterian church the church of scotland but we do and no question be ask it be piece of ecclesiastical deftness that would be inconceivable in any other country however think we would all agree that it be carry out with ease by the late queen elizabeth who demonstrate her commitment to interest in and knowledge of both church throughout her reign an interest passion and dedication now match by our king today we see another brilliant piece of british pragmatism in what we be about to legislate for to many in the outside world the appointment of the brilliant dame elish angiolini to one of the most significant role in scottish public life will rightly be see as well deserve honour for one as successful as she have be in her field and in scottish and british public life when we think about it however it remain quite incredible that practise roman catholic will represent our protestant monarch whose very first act as king in accordance with the act of succession be to take an oath to inviolably maintain and preserve the settlement of the true protestant religion as establish by the laws make in scotland in prosecution of the claim of right and particularly by an act intitule an act for secure the protestant religion and presbyterian church government rightly no question will be ask about her appointment there may in fact be some who question the appointment but think it speak well to we as nation our two nation that we be so relaxed about such an appointment today it speak to just how much scotland have change wonder if the scotland of my grandfather time both of whom be bear in glasgow in the and both of whom go on to be kirk elder would have be as relaxed about such an appointment bear in mind that the church of scotland be form out of the blood and fire of the scottish reformation with john knox in his revolutionary zeal create the only truly national calvinist church it dominate public life for century for well especially in the realm of public education and for bad give that for too long it exclude all other form of christianity and adherence to anything but the kirk form of christianity from most position of influence in public life in scotland the song still sing at certain football ground between fan of certain rival team speak to more difficult time in the history of scotland and indeed the church in scotland one that sadly have not totally be consign to the history book scottish public life be until incredibly recently dominate by the kirk its general assembly be cover in the same way as the sitting of scottish parliament at that point not in existence would have be its membership when be bear in the sit at around million people and its presence touch the life of great many more it have daily five minute slot on scottish television with late call be parody so well by the late great rikki fulton as well as the boys brigade and the women guild so many people have so much interaction with the church but scotland have change and in many way for the well in many way however the change in scotland have present challenge for the church church membership which be just shy of million when be bear sit now at just over the general assembly which for many year sit as the one national forum in scotland at which issue of importance to people across scotland could be air in public and debate be cover as sitting of parliament would be since the creation of the scottish parliament it have not engage the same media interest as it do in the year precede the decline in number enter the ministry and the reduction in footfall in church building across the country have lead to difficult at time heartbreaking decision be take to sell building and reduce the church estate yet there be huge positive as well in recent decade we have see the kirk move with the people of scotland and modernise it allow woman to be ordain back in some year before the church of england do likewise and that lead to huge growth in the number of woman in leadership role in the church the church have have multiple female moderators of the general assembly the first be alison elliot in in the church allow congregation to appoint minister who be in same sex marriage or civil partnership that be follow by it officially approve those marriage and it allow minister to conduct they in whether it be through traditional church service outreach in community across scotland and europe the guild crossreach or missionary work across the world the church of scotland continue to touch and guide our national life in many way religion in britain be funny thing on the one hand we famously do do god on the other we have prayer before every meeting of our national parliament on the one hand unlike other country we treat our religion as private on the other bishop of one of our establish church sit in one of our legislature and our head of state be the supreme governor of one of our two establish church what we be do today will baffle most of those watch our proceeding not least those who do not know that there be two establish church in the united kingdom but it be important and it have the official opposition full support it be significant gesture of good will and unity between two of scotland large church and build on the st margaret declaration of friendship between the catholic church in scotland and the church of scotland in it be yet another display of fantastic british pragmatism and the sensibleness that have underpin how church and the state have interact over century it only remain for on behalf of his majesty official opposition to wish the new lord high commissioner well in her role to thank the outgoing moderator of the church dr shaw paterson for his service over this year to wish the moderator designate rosemary frew well as she take up the role and to wish all those attend the upcoming general assembly wisdom and patience as they deliberate on matter that mean so much to the national life of scotland like so many in my constituency and across scotland have lifelong association with the church of scotland for so many of we in scotland the story of our family be intertwine with local church of scotland parish not just through attendance at church on sunday but through our marking of important life event that link be evidence in so many ordinary aspect of community life at local badminton club meeting in the church hall and at summer fête jumble sale and coffee morning the church belong to all our community it assist the elderly and frail in the community support young mother run youth club and make commitment to international aid my great aunt be an organist in the church in bishopton and in paisley in my constituency my two child be baptise in the church of scotland in paisley and my husband and be marry in drumclog memorial kirk in the constituency of my hon friend the member for east kilbride and strathaven joani reid my sense of belong to the church of scotland be no barrier to my appreciation of other faith and other christian community indeed the church of scotland have demonstrate sincere commitment to ecumenical dialogue the catholic church have be willing and active participant in that effort for more than year that have lead to share commitment to people from all faith and none work together notably in food bank and many other community support service know that my life be enrich by friendship with people of other faith the church of scotland have be similarly enrich today for historical reason that may seem odd to those follow the debate there be legislative restriction on person of the roman catholic faith be appoint lord high commissioner by the sovereign to act as an observer on the sovereign behalf such restriction do not apply to people of other faith or indeed to those of no faith change in the legislation be long overdue be pleased to support the government in remove this unnecessary and unwelcome impediment to roman catholic serve as the representative of his majesty the king at the upcoming general assembly of the church of scotland call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be delight to follow the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire north alison taylor in the almost eight year that have be here do not think have ever look forward to debate this much or take this much pleasure from one not just because there be no real party divide to worry about but because it feel as if the church of scotland of which be but be no long member be finally stand up for the sort of scotland that we all want to see and work towards be no long member of the church but be for many year and my late husband be an elder in the kirk not so very far from the constituency of the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie the church be still huge part of community life in scotland the fact that it have take this long to overturn the injustice of the roman catholic relief act piece of discrimination against roman catholics be something that we should bear in mind and we should promise never to allow this to happen again although it be important that we get this legislation through quickly so that we can appoint lady elish angiolini hope that we address the wide discrimination leave in scottish society this be an important day lady elish have be role model for so many young woman in scotland she be the first female solicitor general lord advocate and lord clerk register and as the minister mention she have be the principal of st hugh college oxford since the fact that she will be the first roman catholic to hold the post of lord high commissioner be significant and far enhance her position as role model everyone have speak to from the church be delighted that she will be in position we liberal democrats completely support the bill and hope that it go through quickly the fact that in we can say that no roman catholic have ever hold the post of lord high commissioner seem slightly absurd there be of course other position in this nation that catholic have never occupy and as matter stand can never occupy it be good that we can break down one of those barrier today and reflect the extremely friendly relationship between the catholic church in scotland and the church of scotland and indeed through the interfaith council the church relationship with other faith too the change be also mark of the high regard in which people of good will hold lady elish angiolini and of the many quality that make she fitting representative of his majesty as we have hear by convention the sovereign be not normally present at the general assembly as he or she be technically an ordinary member of the church not its supreme governor as he or she be in england traditionally the lord high commissioner represent the sovereign and be an observer appoint under the royal prerogative so as we know there be no need for parliamentary approval of the appointment or for legislation as the lord high commissioner be representative to the general assembly rather than part of the assembly it be not necessary for they to be member of the church of scotland or indeed of any other church however the legislation that we be consider be necessary because the holder of the office can not currently be roman catholic the scottish claim of right act set out restriction on catholics be appoint to public office paragraph state that by the law of this kingdome no papist can be king or queen of this realme nor bear any office whatsomever therin those be harsh word if may say so the roman catholic relief act be the culmination of long process work towards give catholics relief from the many restriction impose on they in great britain and ireland prior to the union of however although that act retain some restriction on catholics most of which have since be repeal some significant one remain that be what we wish to amend today as the law society of scotland have suggest it be unfortunate that the bill can not also be amend to remove the reference to the lord high chancellor from the roman catholic relief act so that the act can be bring into conformity with the lord chancellor tenure of office and discharge of ecclesiastical functions act there be clearly long history surround the appointment with the first lord high commissioner have be appoint in in the intervene five century significant people have hold the post include number of former colleague of mine and of the hon member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont and include lord james douglas hamilton lord wallace lord steel and george reid colleague might have spot that they have something in common they be all man it be not until that the late peggy herbison former mp be appoint the first female lord high commissioner we then have to wait another year until the appointment of lady fraser for the second since then the princess royal have hold the post twice and it would be good to think that follow lady elish appointment we might see woman appoint more regularly the appointment be expect to be make we be tell on the basis of the merit and contribution to society of the appointee and lady elish certainly qualify on both count should declare an interest have know lady elish since we be both teenager and member of our respective school debate society she be very much well than be and even then it be clear that she be destine for very significant future also serve in government with she when she be appoint by first minister jack mcconnell as the first female solicitor general elish go on to become the first female lord advocate she hold both position with distinction and be highly regard during her time in office since then she have serve in number of legal post and be currently the principal of st hugh college oxford and pro vice chancellor of the university of oxford she be also the first woman to hold the position of lord clerk of scotland another first for woman significantly she chair the public inquiry into the abduction rape and murder of sarah everard we can safely say that lady elish be an outstanding candidate for the post of lord high commissioner as mention in opening it be regrettable that in we still have such law on the statute book but ironically the relationship between the two church be in very good heart the signing of the st margaret declaration in by the moderator and archbishop cushley the representative of the catholic bishop conference seek to build on the common heritage of the two denomination in the christian tradition it recognise that division be still present but seek to mend those division and to focus on what the church have in common with the passing of the bill today and the appointment of lady elish to the post of lord high commissioner we take another welcome step on the journey to ecumenicalism it be pleasure to follow the hon member for glasgow west patricia ferguson of course we welcome the bill and the government can be assure that we will do whatever we can to assist its progress through the house but as we have hear from many hon member the fact that in the united kingdom be still have to introduce legislation to remove anti catholic legislation from the statute book be pretty embarrassing that people of the roman catholic faith be still explicitly legally bar from hold the position of lord high commissioner of the church of scotland post that can be hold by people of all other faith and those with no religious belief be nonsense do not blame the government or the minister one iota be quite sure that they be as surprised as anybody when after have appoint lady elish angiolini to the office of lord high commissioner one of their lawyer appear blow the cobwebs off the act to reveal the flaw in their plan that do not take away from the fact that it be ridiculous that two century after the act be pass the government be still have to introduce these narrowly focus bills to correct historical wrong as and when they appear while can understand that the government be catch on the hop with regard to this particular appointment share the frustration of the hon member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont who wonder whether it would not be well to bundle all this legislation together and remove all exist anti catholic discrimination rather than just do it piecemeal as and when circumstance arise that may well not have be possible on this occasion give the time constraint of lady elish appointment and so the government be have to get around the problem in this fashion but hope that we never again find ourselves in this situation and that the government will find time to bring forward legislation that once and for all remove all trace of anti catholic discrimination from uk law be the minister to approach his boss with such proposal suspect that he would receive fair hearing as far back as an aspire young barrister now the prime minister write in the guardian describe the uk remain anti catholic law as deeply offensive and an offence to multicultural britain should such bill be introduce would like to think that it would pass through this house quickly and without too much opposition it be important to point out that this situation have nothing whatsoever to do with the church of scotland which to its enormous credit have view the appointment of lady elish to the post of lord high commissioner as completely uncontroversial the fiona smith principal clerk of the general assembly of the church of scotland have say we be honour that his majesty have appoint lady elish angiolini as lord high commissioner we very much look forward to welcome she to the general assembly as other have mention that be remarkable transformation because not so long ago the idea of catholic female particularly one of irish descent be the sovereign official representative in the church of scotland would have be unthinkable to many in this kirk although do not think that the minister be there personally be sure he will remember that it be only in that the infamous report entitle the menace of the irish race to our scottish nationality be present to the general assembly so the appointment of catholic woman as lord high commissioner be welcome by the church of scotland be wonderful example of how far scotland as nation have travel in recent decade as the minister have say and as other have repeat it should come as no surprise to any of we that if there be trail to blaze elish angiolini be the person who be go to blaze it bear elish frances mcphilomy in glasgow and educate at notre dame high school and the university of strathclyde she become one of scotland most prominent lawyer serve as solicitor general as we have hear before become lord advocate she serve under both labour and snp governments at holyrood between and before be appoint to st hugh college the follow year lady elish remain prominent in public life as we have hear she chair several government inquiry into death in police custody and the investigation and prosecution of rape in she publish report on her review of the handling of complaint against police scotland before become chair of the board of trustee at reprieve charity make up of lawyer investigator and campaigner fight for justice for people face human right abuse often at the hand of powerful government as if to cement her trailblaze reputation in october lady elish become the first woman to be swear in as the new lord clerk register of scotland one of the old remain great office of state with origin go back to the century give the circumstance do not think that there could be more appropriate appointment to the role of lord high commissioner of the church of scotland than that of elish angiolini but as have say it be deeply regrettable that because of her religious belief we have have to pass bill in this house to allow it to happen finally give that this bill be welcome but long overdue be delighted to inform the government that should lady elish decide not to take up the role for any reason whatsoever from this day on too be available for selection the hon member for argyll bute and south lochaber brendan have provide most eloquent job application be very pleased to read of the upcoming appointment of lady elish angiolini not only would lady elish be the first roman catholic to hold the office of lord high commissioner but she be incredibly well qualified speak as recover scot lawyer someone who have hold the post of lord advocate and solicitor general with such accomplishment be clearly incredibly well qualified for the role she be an example as be some member of this house of the excellent education you can get from state school in glasgow the current law mean that at present roman catholic can not be lord high commissioner the bill remove the legal impediment to that and therefore fully support it lady elish angiolini be practise roman catholic and much work have be do to build close link between the catholic church in scotland and the church of scotland include the st margaret declaration sign in however as importantly if not more importantly much work have take place between local catholic and church of scotland congregation have see much of that work in glasgow at first hand pretty much every sunday and it be an absolute joy to behold more widely lady elish appointment be another very good example of the progress make between the two church she have say the following of her appointment which be something quite profound that we in this house should pause and reflect on it be really important that people of all religion and faith come together the world be scary place these day and it be important that people of all faith meet share and promote peace and harmony this be good example of that could not agree more say that this bill be important because it be demonstration of people of different religion and faith come together in scotland and put aside their difference in glasgow in scotland and across our family of nation people of different faith and of no faith work very well together for the good of our community in glasgow we see many example of that we have one of the old muslim population in scotland which give greatly to people in glasgow we have vibrant sikh population which dedicate itself to the service of the poor in glasgow and the annual holocaust memorial lecture at the university of glasgow bring large and diverse audience include many of our jewish brother and sister to reflect on the terror of the holocaust people in glasgow and in scotland work hard to understand each other and religious diversity be source of joy energy strength and beauty in glasgow year the appointment of lady elish be profound moment in this year all this speak to the word of the st margaret declaration what we hold in common be often great than what divide we in these time as lady elish suggest it be important that we redouble our effort for dialogue and understanding between people of faith as well as people of no faith at this moment we should also celebrate the real progress we have make in that regard across our family of nation this bill be one very good example and for one be proud to live in family of nation that have have muslim first minister and hindu prime minister be proud to see this bill make progress through this house it be genuine pleasure to close this important debate should begin as other have do by declare an interest in that myself be member of the church of scotland give my thank to hon member on both side of the house for their thoughtful measured and constructive contribution in addition to their substantive support for this worthwhile piece of legislation as we have hear from my right hon friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster this important bill will facilitate the appointment of lady elish angiolini as the first roman catholic to hold the historic office of lord high commissioner the bill will put an end to the statutory constraint that prevent someone from be appoint to that position solely on the basis of their religion in

section of the house of commons members fund act elmore modernisation committee ordered that mike amesbury be discharge from the modernisation committee and chris vince be powell trade diversion and windsor framework motion make and question propose that this house do now owatemi the issue of diversion of trade be become an increase problem of manifold proportion for northern ireland before the protocol good could be move from birmingham to belfast as easily as they could be move from gloucester to glasgow but no more the result irish sea border and all that come with it have cause huge and increase diversion of trade we can get an insight into how thing naturally should be and how business wish they to be by look at the northern ireland statistics and research agency figure of recent year if we look at the pre protocol day we see that in for example the volume of good purchase from the irish republic be billion but the amount purchase from gb be five time billion there we have snapshot of the natural inclination of trade in northern ireland particularly for our raw material before brexit there be similar situation indeed we could say and some may say that that be well reflection of whether there have be trade diversion before brexit we could as readily buy our good from the republic as we could from gb because we be all in the eu single market even then the predominant trading of choice be from gb that be no surprise because for decade northern ireland have be particularly integrate part of the uk economy however along come the protocol which require northern ireland to be subject to foreign custom code that of the eu which of course treat gb as if it be foreign country therefore when good come from outside the eu into the eu and we in northern ireland be regard as be in the eu for these purpose those good have to be check with custom declaration documentary check and physical check on for example all our raw material so it be no surprise that that be inevitably bind to cause diversion of trade we be tell as part of the spin of sell the protocol oh there be protection against the diversion of trade and it would be allow to happen article of the protocol we be tell be our safety net if the application of this protocol lead to diversion of trade the united kingdom may unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measure it have lead to the diversion of trade but the united kingdom government have not take unilateral action in that regard the fact of the diversion of trade be challenge to the protocol proponent it be challenge to those who put this upon we and it be one that they have to meet but which fear they will not meet where be the proof some may ask of the diversion of trade again it be in the nisra statistic dr esmond birnie renowned economist in northern ireland have do succession of study of the nisra statistic he write back on december that the datum provide further evidence that the ni economy be become more trade integrate with the republic and of north south trade grow at very rapid rate at the expense of what previously be an inflow of good from gb will the hon member give way perhaps in moment we also see that in the purchase of good figure that nisra report it have give we figure from contrast they in table with those for the year be only the beginning of thing get difficult as the irish sea border do not in effect come into place until october because of the grace period however those nisra figure show that northern ireland purchase of good increase from to of course it be period of inflation by from gb but by from the republic of ireland mean twice the growth rate in the buying of good into northern ireland that would previously have come from our integrate united kingdom economy the office for national statistics business insight and condition survey state that of currently trading manufacturer base in gb have send good to northern ireland in the past month that be at the end of but in january of manufacturer in gb be send good to northern ireland so in just those four year there have be dramatic fall in the number of manufacturer supply good to northern ireland it have nearly halve in four year the ons datum for tell we more of company tell we they have stop trade with northern ireland why because of the bureaucracy because they have to make custom declaration because they have to have they check and because they have to employ extra staff to do all that many company particularly in small sector have simply say that they be not go to do it will the hon and learn gentleman give way in moment perhaps need to make sure get through what need to say it be beyond doubt would respectfully say that there have be trade diversion back in september the road haulage association give evidence to parliamentary committee of this house it tell the committee that of haulage lorry that take good to gb be return empty why because gb company have stop supply now that be an incredible thing to contemplate trade work on the basis that you take good out and then you fill your lorry and bring good back that be how you make it viable and how the economy work that of lorry now return to northern ireland be return empty be an incredible indictment of the operation of the protocol and thing be get bad the eu regulation on general product safety now put more burden on company sell into northern ireland because they have to meet enhance eu product safety regulation have mention the craft sector in this house before recently supplier in that niche market stop supply northern ireland it will get bad because the partial border be come and they will have to do more paperwork and make more declaration about send simple parcel from gb to northern ireland tesco have slide that it show to its own supplier state that they should now buy from the republic of ireland because it be easy to supply from there than from gb the same be happen in veterinary medicine and in every sector why do that matter it matter for very pertinent political reason the whole idea of trade diversion and the whole purpose of the protocol be and be to build an all ireland economy to dismantle the economic link between great britain and northern ireland and enhance link with the irish republic thereby create stepping stone out of the united kingdom into an all ireland for northern ireland that be the determination that lie behind the protocol we do not need protocol to govern trade it be demonstrable that if we can organise trade through northern ireland to gb without border check in the irish sea and if as the government now say be possible we can do it with check away from the border then equally we could do it in the other direction through mutual enforcement that would mean recognise that if we be go to export from one territory to another our manufacturer must produce good to the standard of the other and we would enforce that by make it criminal offence to do otherwise that be the essence of mutual enforcement it would work but it be not allow to work because the political agenda of the protocol be to ensure this reorientation and realignment we be tell that we now have intertrade uk but it have no staff and no budget in comparison with intertradeireland which have more than staff and budget of million year and be active across the whole area intertrade uk have be set up as shadow but it be not able to compete in any sense this government have allow the economy of northern ireland to drift out of the united kingdom believe those who be protocol enthusiast want that to happen now it be happen the onus be back on the government to do something about it rise before the hon and learn gentleman take the intervention know that he be anxious about get through his speech but because the adjournment debate start early he do have until pm laughter believe he be about to take an intervention do he want to continue with that will give way you should encourage he madam deputy speaker he will take to pm and beyond because this be such an important subject do the hon and learn gentleman agree that the diversion of trade have not only political but economic implication for northern ireland there be increase transport cost because lorry do not come both way with good in they there be the fact that many people choose supplier in england because they be cheap well quality and so on and now manufacturer in northern ireland be have to go to the second good supplier and there be also the additional paperwork that be involve that all add to cost and make the northern ireland economy less competitive which therefore make it more difficult for it to be viable the right hon gentleman be absolutely right business be like water it follow the easy course when we be an integrated part of the uk economy the easy and cheap course be to do the great bulk of our trade with gb that historically have be our basic supply market for our raw material and everything else however when fettering of trade be impose naturally business will follow the easy route the easy route now sadly be to cease trading from gb and accentuate trading with the eu and most particularly the republic of ireland the united kingdom be build on two pillar accord to the act of union the first be political union with article establish this house as one sovereign parliament for the whole united kingdom the second be an economic union through article which establish unfettered trade between and within all part of the united kingdom that be what article say that there should be unfettered trade but along come the protocol which fetter trade leave the supreme court with no choice but to accept that the protocol have therefore subjugate article the very foundation of our economic union article which say that there shall be unfettered trade be in suspension it be no wonder that the consequence of that fettering of trade be diversion of trade thank the hon and learn member for give way it be on that diversion of trade that wish to speak he and most northern ireland mp will know of the fantastic colemans garden centre in my constituency of south antrim it supply quite number of people across northern ireland who have have difficulty in get plant and fruit bring across from their main supplier mcintyre fruit in scotland just before this debate the manager of colemans garden centre tell that he have be in contact with stuart mcintyre who say that he have just pick up contract to supply firm in japan he say that bureaucracy wise and administration wise it be easy for supplier in scotland to supply into japan than it be to supply across the mile stretch of water into northern ireland that be the absurdity of where we have get to and it have be accentuate by our subjection to the eu general product safety regulation those regulation provide that if company be supply into northern ireland from outside the eu in other word from gb it must have an agent resident within the eu the company must complete the paperwork on the origin of its good and on the custom declaration and it can not do so without employ an agent within the eu anyone who know anything about business will know that that be add cost that will cause many business to say northern ireland be not huge market to start with so shall just not bother with it that be what all our business in northern ireland be suffer from congratulate the hon and learn member on secure this debate small business in my constituency have tell that they be now have to pay his majesty revenue and customs duty for buy good from english supplier and then sell the same good in northern ireland to the northern ireland consumer remain within the internal market last friday one trader tell that he be now have to pay more in duty to hmrc than the invoice be for the good that be because hmrc do not trust that the good will remain but assume that they will be sell into the eu do the hon and learn member not agree that the same hmrc display great trust and acceptance of vat declaration on the premise that they will be check at random than it do for internal trade within the united kingdom what backward step that be agree let we just think about the irish sea border give the infinitesimal amount of good and trade that cross that border infinitesimal when compare with the proportion of eu trade it be incredible that it have of all the check across the whole of the eu that infinitesimal amount when set against the totality of eu trade warrant of all the check in the eu it would be easy to bring in good from belarus into the eu than it be to bring good from gb into northern ireland the hon and learn member talk about that trade be of eu trade cross that border yet it account for of check do he agree that that will not be the story of the future in my constituency we be already build million eu control post on acre site once that be open there will be much more scope to check good to an even great degree if that be not the point of have such large eu border post in the middle of the united kingdom what be that be the point because it be an eu border eu trade law govern the irish sea border eu official under the protocol have the right to supervise check when we have the full panoply of facility that be be build at larne and at other port fear that we will see the muscle of eu inspection the protocol give the eu which boast that the price of brexit would be northern ireland the upper hand in that regard return to the point that the protocol be imbue with political motivation and that motivation be not to get northern ireland the good of both world my goodness what con that idea be the protocol be suppose to make northern ireland mecca singapore of the west but we now know that there have be no uplift whatsoever in foreign direct investment why because manufacturer come to northern ireland be interested not just in sell good out of northern ireland but in where it be get its raw material when manufacturer be tell that its basic supply line have to pass through an international custom border control by the eu the shine soon go off the prospect of invest in northern ireland we be in pretty dire situation which be get bad and which have massive constitutional and economic implication but fear that the government be deaf and blind to the issue because they do not want to face the consequence they be hand in glove with the eu dismantle northern ireland place in the united kingdom and set we on course for the economic marry with the politic and northern ireland cease to be we be tell by the previous administration that with the new green lane and the windsor framework all would be glorious it could be the good of both world do the previous administration mislead the house not just the previous administration think there have be gross calculated and deliberate misleading about the protocol from day one we be tell that the green lane be go it have not we still have to do custom declaration we still have document check but all our raw material must by dint of the protocol come through the red lane so they must be subject to all the rigour of the eu international border that be what will cripple our economy we have see it in small craft sector niche sector that depend on small supplier be give up when that bite as it will we will see that right across our economy the government need to find some dignity and stand up for this united kingdom which be not just great britain but include northern ireland it be time to put some mettle into defend that position and to row back from the disastrous destructive element that the protocol have bring we congratulate the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister on secure the debate the house once again have be leave in no doubt but that he speak about northern ireland trading arrangement with fervour and sincerity as he do in the westminster hall debate in november to which respond and in the debate on his private member bill in december to which the under secretary of state for northern ireland reply on the government behalf on the windsor framework his position be quite clear he be oppose to it the secretary of state have outline that on number of occasion both he and the under secretary have respond to issue that the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister have raise he will be aware that write to he about month ago about the problem with horticultural industry trade between scotland and northern ireland but have yet to get response can only apologise to the hon gentleman try hard to be punctilious about respond to correspondence those watch will have note what he say and he can hope anticipate receive reply from very soon for the government part want to be equally clear we need to have system in place for manage unique set of circumstance the system we have be the inevitable result of leave the european union that be where this all begin if that have not happen we would not be have this discussion what do that result in two trading entity the united kingdom and the european union with different rule but an open border between they that be to be find nowhere else in the world in other word all of we together everyone have to take responsibility for what they argue for and for the consequence of that face the question how do we deal with the unique situation of two trading entity with different rule have an open border between they the way not to deal with it be to say we the united kingdom will hand over part of our territory to eu jurisdiction we will put it under the eu custom code which will decree the rest of the united kingdom foreign territory we will subject that part of our territory to have area of its law not make in the united kingdom law in those area can not even be amend in the united kingdom it will be foreign law impose this could have be deal with by mutual enforcement we could have say we want to trade with each other and we want to be neighbourly so we will guarantee on pain of criminal conviction that anything we send into your territory meet your standard and vice versa why do thing have to be make complicated at the expense of jettison northern ireland from the united kingdom economically and constitutionally the hon and learn gentleman argue in favour of what he call mutual enforcement but that be not credible basis for resolve the dilemma create by our leave the european union indicate dissent the hon and learn gentleman may disagree be express the government view which be that it be not credible basis one thing be absolutely clear the answer be never to try to wish the dilemma away and pretend that it do not exist be afraid that at time it have appear as though that argument have be advance the first go at try to find an answer be the chequers plan which do not get support the northern ireland protocol be the second go but that be never go to work make that argument as an opposition back bencher so the windsor framework be negotiate there be no deny that the windsor framework represent huge improvement on the prospect create by the northern ireland protocol the secretary of state say that the situation be unprecedented and that unique arrangement have therefore be put in place the government recently recognise that the flow of trade from the irish republic through northern ireland into gb could cause situation where good have to be check to safeguard the gb market yet they have be able to put in place arrangement without all this elaboration that do not require law to apply to trader in the irish republic they be simply check away from the border if the unique situation of trade from gb into northern ireland which have non check border with the republic have to be deal with through labyrinth of regulation why be it possible to avoid that in the other direction if such arrangement can work from northern ireland to gb why can they not work from gb to northern ireland the answer be this as sovereign country it fall to we to decide how we check good that arrive in our territory for quite period after our leave the european union the last government be not check stuff come across the channel first because there be nowhere to do the check and secondly because they be concern about delay shortage and add cost for the consumer they repeatedly put off implement check at the same time british exporter be experience the full impact of check on the good that they send the other way across the channel to calais and the rest of the european union it be for sovereign country to determine what check they apply the same truth apply to the european union it have single market we be responsible country some may argue that we should be irresponsible and say well this be not our problem let we leave it to the eu to sort it out in the end we have to have negotiate answer to the question create by our departure from the european union on the good that cross that non existent border the one thing that almost everybody agree on during the brexit debate be that the border need to remain as it be that open border be important for whole host of reason not least the extraordinary progress that northern ireland have make in the year since the signing of the good friday agreement the question therefore be how do the eu ensure that good that cross that border and come into the republic and go on to france germany or greece meet the rule in exactly the same way we would ask how do we know that good come into the united kingdom meet our law the only way to do that be with negotiation the right hon gentleman say that it be up to sovereign nation to look after its own border and determine its own check do he accept that there have be trade diversion within the united kingdom if so do he accept that it be within the government remit to use article or drop the check to protect trade within our sovereign border have only just begin my remark but if the hon gentleman will bear with shall shortly come to the point that he raise the windsor framework protect the uk internal market while as argue moment ago enable the eu to be confident that its rule will be respect the government view and my view be that that be the responsible thing to do in the circumstance because this government support sustainable arrangement for northern ireland that respect its particular circumstance indeed they be unique and its place in the union and that uphold the good friday agreement the hon and learn member for north antrim central argument this evening be that we should trigger article the unilateral safeguard in the windsor framework to do that would be contrary to northern ireland have stable arrangement for trade now and in future it would disregard the benefit that the windsor framework offer for business indeed the benefit that be actively rely upon by business include those that be take advantage of northern ireland unique access to the uk and eu the hon and learn member for north antrim shake his head but have meet business that have tell how they be take advantage of that dual market access meet business in my constituency that can see what northern ireland have get out of these unique arrangement those benefit will be enhance by the uk internal market be the phrase that will come into force in the near future and that will on durable and legally binding basis support the smooth flow of good across the whole of the uk when the next phase of the uk internal market system be implement this year without for example unnecessary international custom paperwork we have see the benefit of negotiate way forward there be unilateralism as the hon and learn gentleman argue and there be the benefit of negotiation in respect of agrifood and sanitary and phytosanitary measure we have be able to lift the old ban on the movement of seed potato not all those problem have be solve be the first to acknowledge that but it be an improvement compare with the situation before we be now able to apply uk public health and safety standard to agrifood on the basis of primacy for good stay in the united kingdom move under the windsor framework scheme we have reach agreement with the eu on tariff rate quota enable business from northern ireland to import steel and agrifood product under uk tariff rate we also have an active assembly that be scrutinise the regulation and raise its well will come back to that point later on medicine for the whole of the uk be now authorise by the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency and we have ensure that northern ireland benefit from the same vat alcohol duty and other taxis as the rest of the uk all of those be undoubted benefit for northern ireland they be benefit of the framework that support northern ireland access to the two market and from which this integral part of the united kingdom which northern ireland be uniquely benefit this be possible because we have lawful and sustainable agreement in stark contrast to what the hon and learn gentleman have propose as way forward would be the first to acknowledge from this dispatch box that the windsor framework be not perfect we all know that where problem arise with the practical operation of the framework this government and the eu have try to show that we can work through they in constructive and pragmatic way because that be what we have to do for example have listen to business we take pragmatic decision to extend on the timetable for implement the new arrangement on parcel one of the consequence of do that be that the introduction of the new less onerous custom arrangement be put off because the eu view be that we need to do the parcel at the same time in order for the new custom arrangement to come in another example be the horticultural sector where in the last month the restriction on the movement of two specie of plant be remove if we be talk about tree think that take it up to include our beloved silver birch and be advise number of variety of cherry tree that be sort out at the end of last year on the question of the stormont brake we act on the concern that the northern ireland assembly raise about the potential implication of the new rule on chemical label font size and so on by commit to consult on take forward measure across the uk that will protect the uk internal market would just point out because the hon gentleman look slightly sceptical that there be high bar to be meet for the stormont brake when receive the application as secretary of state be under legal obligation to consider the application under the rule of the stormont brake and make the decision that do in the end what the government announce be move towards the same outcome that those who have raise the concern in the first place want just by different mean than they have seek in the end the stormont brake process actually work to achieve the outcome that the assembly want think the secretary of state should listen to himself what he be say to the house be that we should be grateful for some sort of dud mechanism to deal with the situation whereby the right to make law in area have be gift to foreign power and that people elect in northern ireland can have no say in those law and can not amend move or bring they into effect he say that we should be grateful that in those area of law we might be able to go to the eu and say please sir would you ever mind just make that little well really where be the sense of dignity from this united kingdom that we should so prostrate ourselves to foreign unelected jurisdiction elect by no one in the united kingdom allow they to make our law and then claim as victory the fact that we have right to go and ask they to make some change but the secretary of state have fail to answer the question there be trade diversion what be he go to do about it be not ask anyone to be grateful for anything be simply point out to the house the problem that be create in the first place when we leave the european union it be punishment if hear the hon and learn gentleman correctly from sedentary position he say punishment could not disagree more would encourage he to reflect on what he have say because do not think that he acknowledge that there be an issue there that have to be address and wish it away be never go to work be remind of the wee song we use to sing in sunday school many year ago so high you can get over it so low you can get under it the stormont brake do not work because it be too high and too low it be just not functional in my intervention on the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister refer to the hmrc cost to give the secretary of state an example last week business say that the hmrc charge have get to the stage where they be even more expensive than the good the business be bring in there have to be something wrong when it get to the stage where it be not the issue of get the product across but the cost factor could the secretary of state look at that because there be something wrong with system that end up cost we more when it do not cost that amount before the brexit system come in if the hon gentleman wish to provide with further information about the particular example he have raise will of course look at it on trade have slightly different set of figure from those that the hon and learn gentleman use from to purchase in northern ireland from gb go from billion to billion an increase of sale to the year end december from northern ireland to gb rise by to billion he use phrase at the beginning of his speech hope write it down correctly the natural inclination of trade would simply observe that the inclination of trade be consequence of decision that individual and firm make and those pattern change over time depend on what they want to buy or sell and what the market itself look like the point be make without seek gratitude be that in every one of the example have just give the government work to resolve the challenge we face work with stakeholder in northern ireland and with the eu in what think be constructive and mutually beneficial way that be what responsible government do include abide by commitment in international law on the world stage the hon and learn gentleman advocate trigger article that measure refer both to trade and to instance where serious economic societal or environmental difficulty be liable to persist give that most good be flow relatively smoothly between great britain and northern ireland how can it be argue that we be face those difficulty would just make the point that if one go to the port the lorry come off and most of they go on their way the good be move that be in contrast to the argument that the hon and learn gentleman put towards the end of his speech when he use the phrase cripple in relation to the northern ireland economy have see no evidence that the northern ireland economy which by the way have the low unemployment in the whole of the united kingdom be be cripple by the matter that we be discuss rise will give way but then will make progress the secretary of state be be very generous with his time he just say most good be flow freely do he not agree that he should amend that to say in certain sector most good be flow freely but in certain other sector they most certainly be not it depend on the hon gentleman definition of freely there be requirement that certain good must meet there be the retail movement scheme and the horticultural scheme and certain paperwork and document be require look forward to the custom requirement be reduce later this year hopefully when the new arrangement come in but the good move and do not think that anyone in the debate can stand up and say that the good be not move in those circumstance as have indicate the windsor framework represent step forward although respect the sincerity with which the hon and learn member for north antrim make his argument do not believe that current circumstance meet the article test pull that lever in the current circumstance would actually throw away the progress secure by the framework and damage the good faith that have be build up in take the framework forward we all need to remember that not long ago we have government who sign an international agreement and then set about show that they have no intention of honour it that do extraordinary damage to the united kingdom international reputation rise the hon and learn gentleman have have quite lot to say and have give way to he three time so hope he will bear with while continue my remark in the past the idea that the uk would be country that sign an international agreement and then renege upon it would have be extraordinary to we all in this house but that be what happen in very recent living memory and it be why put this point to the hon and learn gentleman the last government negotiate the windsor framework stand up in the house and support it the opposition support it at that time and vote for it because genuinely believe that it represent significant step forward but if we do not honour the most recent agreement that we have sign with the european union why would it wish to reach agreement on what this government be currently seek in particular on an sps veterinary and agrifood agreement this government have come in say that we want to do that while the last government appear to say well the trade and co operation agreement be all we want we do want anything else this government have very different view we want to negotiate an sps veterinary and agrifood agreement and that would help considerably with some of the issue that have be raise during the debate the government will continue to listen to the concern of business and respond pragmatically have listen intently to the secretary of state contribution and be somewhat bemused by some of what he say he speak of business in his constituency that be jealous of what northern ireland business have what we have in northern ireland be increase cost increase paperwork and impediment to trade it be increasingly difficult for engineering agrifood and horticultural business in my constituency have invite the secretary of state to visit those business but be still wait encourage he to come to northern ireland and listen to the business that be impact by the protocol and the windsor framework on daily basis also hear today about two plant that have be add to the ever lengthen list of plant that be not available to northern ireland well whoop de do da day how brilliant and great for northern ireland when be we go to get real and address the real problem that exist with the protocol and the windsor framework kind though it be of the hon member to encourage to come to northern ireland as she know be in northern ireland on very regular basis and little while ago have meeting with she and two organisation at her request meet business on very regular basis meet the northern ireland chamber of commerce and industry brexit work group and always do my level well to respond to request for visit from colleague in the house of commons include the hon lady but there be only so many hour in the day want to point out that the independent monitoring panel which meet for the first time yesterday have start its work establish the panel be commitment make in the safeguarding the union command paper its job will be on the basis of the evidence and it will be provide with datum on the flow of good between great britain and northern ireland to say whether the uk internal market guarantee be be meet the first six month reporting period commence on january and will conclude on june follow which the imp will publish its assessment and any recommendation commit to the hon and learn member for north antrim and all those who contribute to the debate that shall consider the report with the same attention to detail that he have show in forward his argument today to conclude this government be commit to northern ireland they be commit to the united kingdom and to implement the windsor framework in manner that be consistent with protect northern ireland place within our internal market question put and agree to house adjourn
