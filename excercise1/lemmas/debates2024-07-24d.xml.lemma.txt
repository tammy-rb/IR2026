he now move on to the other place be certain that his child and his family legacy will follow in his footstep in year to come this sentiment of service be something that resonate deeply with service be fundamental to who be and it be fundamental to the government and to my commitment to the wonderful constituency of leyton and wanstead be here because my constituent place their trust in trust for which be grateful and will repay with service and commitment to ensure they be represent in this place to the full of my ability at the centre of my constituency be leytonstone at the heart of which be our beloved whipps cross hospital whipp have serve our constituency for year during which time its nhs staff quiet professional have give selflessly for those in need within our community yet this hospital be emblematic of year of fail tory commitment and lack of investment its rebuilding be central to my tenure as an mp leytonstone be also cradle for talent have be home to notable figure such as my namesake david bailey and cartrain and sport star jo fenn andros townsend and david beckham leytonstone be the home of raf pedigree of douglas webb dfm the front gunner in the famous dam buster raid and more lately of james sjoberg officer commanding squadron leverage this rich heritage to inspire our youth and give they pathway to success be personal commitment of mine opportunity like these be scarce for young people like create similar pathway for our youth will be central to my service leytonstone be also home to one of the most financially deprive area in the country but it be spirited community that seek to heal itself community leadership from cann hall mosque ensure the provision to all local people of much need food bank and youth group similarly at st margaret with st columba other gather to preserve sense of community despite their obvious hardship community spirit be also strong in south woodford and wanstead if whipps be the heart of our constituency wanstead park be its lung and the river rode its vein wanstead park be part of our historic epping forest which be save by campaigner such as octavia hill founder of the national trust and the spirit of activism and preservation continue in the wanstead community gardeners the south woodford society and the ever popular wanstead fringe festival to the south be leyton home of leyton orient football club the and their trust embody the good of our community from their sacrifice in the pal regiment in the first world war to their work with waltham forest age uk they support our vulnerable veteran the club be also proud to celebrate our diverse community epitomise by laurie cunningham the club first black player his legacy continue to inspire as do the leadership of omar beckles in improve representation in football such leadership be reflective of the club leadership in the establishment of governance for our footballe world effort such as these be key to visible role model and leadership be essential for diverse community without these inspirational character young black people like will not see themselves in place of power reflect on the very low number of black man in our politic despite an increase in representation across all ethnic group address this be key to fix the inequality that face young people particularly in the area of knife crime pivotal moment in my upbringing be the murder of stephen lawrence while we be aware of the continue failure to provide justice to my friend stuart family we all know of the institutional failing that have lead to this want to point all member to number of thing surround this that be formative for first the absence of representation inhibit our ability to hear voice and understand the challenge face by other like we reflect during the campaign that when be young carry knife not because wish to attack anyone but because be scared and feel that the fate that have befall my friend brother could happen to and other like mistakenly assume that could look after myself similarly but sadly we know that be not the case and that those who carry knife be more likely to be kill themselves we need people like to translate those experience into policy secondly and in some way most importantly look back with great upset and anger on how this matter be politicise by extreme group our anger and upset be channel by populist who manipulate we for their own political end those voice be present in our house and vocal in our politic and we must challenge they openly to prevent those actor from foster anger hate and division within our community fear it be our great threat to democracy and we must be fundamental in our moderation we must challenge those behaviour without fear openly separate they from the underlie issue finally what see through that period in my life and through highly decorate fly career in the royal air force be the two thing value most first my friend and secondly my family my mother and father instill in the value and virtue of service and humanity my sister shape and help to see the world through the eye of woman my friend shepherd through school college and university and through every difficult challenge in my life but it be my wife who have support steadfastly through military career and grow our wonderful family love she deeply and will never be able to thank she enough the reason be here be my service not just as member of this house but to our nation in the raf have choose to speak in this debate because as young engineering student recall learning of the failing of the duncan sandys defence review which do deep and lasting damage to our aerospace industry and industrial base already we have hear voice state that our commitment to this programme be fallacy but acceptance of that be merely acceptance of failure to manage defence programme and the company contract to deliver they it be not gcap that be fallacy but the way we contract and manage such programme our interaction with defence prime must change we must encourage risk taking because without it there be no innovation we must not allow the customer to set the demand for technology that the customer itself can not conceive we must be government who well understand science and we need an industry that be incentivise with accountability we have the sixth large defence budget in the world we must get our money worth and we must make sure that our money lead to our security and not to excess corporate bonus for that reason the remark by the minister for the armed forces about the sanctity of the defence review be key we can not allow defence simply to be buy out of its overspend this be an exciting programme with two close and value partner and the government defence review be critical to it congratulate the hon member for southampton itchen darren paffey on his maiden speech this be my maiden speech madam deputy speaker and must tell you that arrive in this place fire with enthusiasm so much so that my whip have warn that need to be careful that that be not how end up leave this place fire with enthusiasm be new woman represent new constituency chester south

and many and varied village in the heart of cheshire audlem bunbury wybunbury wrenbury weaverham lache handbridge christleton and huntington tarporley tattenhall tarvin kelsall cuddington farndon malpas those be just some of the very special place with which you madam deputy speaker and this house be go to become quite familiar in the come year hope much of my constituency be rural which be one reason why find the king speech so disappointing this government profess an ambition for growth if so it be simply extraordinary that there be no mention of the contribution of farming to our national economy food be fundamental the contribution of the countryside to our country be incalculable and government who be so metropolitan in their outlook that they fail to understand that and reflect it in their agenda be to use the context of today debate both miss an opportunity and in need of an education my constituency be both urban and rural as be our country understand the importance of both and the necessary balance between the two be key to our country future economic and societal success the joy of my constituency be that it include rich range of dynamic village community and swathe of one of the great historic city in europe the matchless city of chester it be business and tourism hub that face challenge of course from basic connectivity to burdensome

include nearly student with send support who do not have education health and care plan those student will face vat under the government current plan plan that will reduce choice for parent and increase pressure on the state school system with no clear benefit to any of our young people chester south and eddisbury have much to offer from the glory of delamere forest which welcome more than visitor each year to the excitement of oulton park racetrack and peckforton castle the home of civil wedding in england say that advisedly because it be the then owner of peckforton castle who inspire former member of parliament for the city of chester to introduce private member bill that become the marriage act for the first time that act allow civil wedding in this country to take place in venue other than registry office include castle historic house hotel and chester zoo some might argue that that single piece of legislation have contribute more to happiness in england than any other legislation of its type the former member who introduce that legislation who know quite well in fact have know he since be bear remind regularly that his act illustrate how in this place an ordinary back bencher can make difference hope to make difference in the year to come not only by badger the government about deliver local bus service and improve mobile phone and broadband connectivity and demand that they back our farmer and ensure the investment and infrastructure our village and city need to thrive but perhaps by introduce legislation of my own in the fullness of time draw inspiration from my constituency and from my predecessor not only my father who be the member for city of chester in the mr speaker will know both how marvellous and sometimes how irritate it can be

true honour to be here as the new member of parliament for aylesbury give that my constituency house the county town of buckinghamshire and have return long line of conservative members to parliament as might be expect from that county be particularly proud to be here as aylesbury first ever labour mp and its first female mp my constituency be very diverse geographically it cover the rapidly grow town of aylesbury many lovely village such as whitchurch wing cheddington and edlesborough historic woodland and farmland and the chiltern hill it also have very diverse community with people of christian muslim hindu and other faith and people of asian african and eastern european heritage live alongside elderly resident and young people whose family have call my constituency home for many generation we be historic constituency too britain old road the ridgeway cross through to ivinghoe beacon the remain of an iron age hill fort lie beneath aylesbury town and an aylesbury constituency have exist in some form since it be from aylesbury that john hampden defend parliament against charles in and his statue overlook market square in the town centre still celebrate the parliamentary freedom that he champion perhaps will not dwell for too long on our conservative lean political history from then onwards but want to highlight three other way in which history shape my brilliant constituency today first there be our vibrant culture roald dahl make buckinghamshire his home and today we host the roald dahl child gallery at discover bucks museum we be the birthplace of the paralympic movement and host the first competition for people with spinal injury in stoke mandeville back in for decade aylesbury be home to the iconic friars nightclub where act like queen and perform david bowie first performance of ziggy stardust there be now mark in the town by bronze sculpture which burst into song catch visitor by surprise secondly my constituency have history of offer friendly welcome include to many evacuee from london in world war two and the exile czech government who operate out of old manor house between wingrave and aston abbotts you can still see the bus shelter that the czech president instruct to be build on that road have take pity on the local schoolchildren wait in the rain we have see the same welcome to many people who have move into the constituency in recent decade and particularly into the many new housing development in the area thirdly want to highlight the inequality in income and wealth that exist in the constituency member of this house may be surprised to hear that aylesbury have high level of deprivation in fact one in eight child in the town live in poverty and we have always have history of people struggle to get by on low wage in the print and car factory or as agricultural labourer pay tribute to the local food bank and to fantastic charity like youth concern and aylesbury homeless action group which make life more manageable for those who be struggle most today but they should not have to exist that take to the four point that will prioritise as the member for aylesbury and to the reason why want to speak in today debate on education and opportunity above all want my constituent to feel sense of opportunity and optimism again first will focus on the desperate need to improve healthcare we be home to stoke mandeville hospital where my son be bear and its internationally renowned spinal injury unit have the deep respect for everyone who work in the healthcare sector across the constituency but we have to make it possible for people to get basic healthcare and to see their gp again and we have to tackle the awful and pervasive mental health crisis in my constituency and across the country one of my most brilliant and good friend sophie middlemiss be not here to witness this moment of great change and opportunity for our country because she take her own life when her little girl be week old do not want anyone to suffer from post natal depression and anxiety in the way that she do and will fight to get well help for people in her situation secondly will focus on education for our child and will fight to ensure that all child whatever their background and circumstance get the opportunity that they deserve in life be particularly concerned about send child be pleased to have hear lot about that in the house today and their parent family carer and teacher who be not get anything like the support they deserve that have to change thirdly will help our business to thrive will support the small business that hope will be part of revival of aylesbury town centre we have to make it safe and attractive place to spend time again and we have to make it possible to get in across and out of town without spend hour in traffic will also support the farming business in the rural part of our constituency within wide careful approach to protect and manage our nature rich and agricultural land finally come to this job conscious not just of the challenge and the opportunity for my constituency and my country but of the very challenging moment that we be in globally before come to parliament be lead humanitarian aid agency and will continue to be voice for and do right by the most vulnerable people around the world there be record number of people catch up in conflict and crisis at time when geopolitical rivalry be on the rise and the global institution set up after world war two no long offer the protection that they use to strong and principled britain can make real difference in the world and know this matter to my constituent most pressingly in their concern about the awful suffering in gaza and the suffering of the israeli hostage and their family let conclude with one final point mention that aylesbury be home to the roald dahl children gallery so will end with some inspiration from matilda perhaps roald dahl fine character certainly that be my daughter view matilda say have power be not nearly as important as what you choose to do with it every day in this place of power we all make choice will know if have make the right choice if people in crisis around the world and most importantly people struggle in my constituency tell that have play my part in make positive difference to their life thank you very much madam deputy speaker for call to make my first speech in this place today and in debate on education subject that be very important to as this be my first contribution ought to start by thank the people of north west cambridgeshire for

the subject of today debate as be the young member of this member hear hear thank member it will not surprise many member to hear that have not be out of the education system for that long indeed be in the first cohort of student whose level exam be cancel during the pandemic in many way it be that experience that politicise grow up in deprive rural area and be concern from young age to see progressive decline in local high street alongside grow problem in public service notably within school when be in my final year at rural school budget cut force the closure of its sixth form leave and many other have to find alternative provision at short notice which be not easy for many who face very long journey indeed to the near alternative the closure not only disrupt education but fragment the community as student be scatter to different institution but never connect those issue to politic and the decision be make in this place until see the direct impact of those decision on school during the pandemic the response to the crisis the decision about exam and the support or lack thereof provide to student make it clear to great many previously disengage young people that political choice have real and immediate consequence we have to work across this house to improve engagement with our democracy and large part of that must revolve around rebuild trust in politic and get to position where we disagree respectfully and work together to make life well for the people we represent my background be in science biology in particular and that have instill in the importance of have solid evidence behind the decision that we make here we see during the pandemic that communicate the rationale behind decision take by the government be very difficult which highlight why there be such need to improve how we teach science in school and will champion that intend to use my direct experience of the problem in our school to contribute to the government agenda to revitalise
