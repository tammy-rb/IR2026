the christmas fayre yesterday and that you load up on good from frank luxury biscuits from herefordshire just as heavily as do be wonder who eat all the biscuit and just in time for small business saturday too understand that the prime minister will deliver speech later today set out his plan for change must say be delighted be sure we all be to hear that the government be at last adopt plan and be try to change as we have so often note at business question the government first five month have be festival no carnival supermarket sweep fill your boot all you can eat blunder of delay and incompetence you mr speaker more than any member of this house will be aware that the effective functioning of parliament rest on its ability to hold ministers to account that have be true since its origin in the century and arguably since even before that as you will know the practice of seek reason and explanation for official action be they the passage of bills or the raising of taxation be not some useful add on or afterthought it be absolutely foundational to the whole idea of parliament as deliberative assembly so be sure that you will understand my disappointment that the leader of the house have be so persistently unwilling to answer or even address the simple question that have put to she in recent week on november draw attention to the government incompetence in combine at the same time three measure on national insurance and the minimum wage in way that drastically raise the cost of hire entry level staff and ask for an assessment of the total impact of those measure be afraid that the leader of the house response be to blame the previous government and to talk about employer who will pay no additional national insurance completely different group quite irrelevant to the question ask on november again highlight this problem and get the same response blame the last government and change the subject also extend my concern about the government incompetence to include their decision to bring the clean energy commitment forward from to and highlight vast array of public and official worry about whether this be either achievable or financially viable in response be sorry to say the leader of the house again do not engage with either question instead accuse of political opportunism last week we see the same thing once more for the third time raise the question of labour triple whammy in combine change to national insurance rate and threshold with change to the minimum wage this time the leader of the house do not simply duck the question and change the subject she also give the benefit of little homily on the duty of the opposition it be true that the duty of the opposition be topic on which unlike the duty of government she have build up considerable expertise over more than decade but the real point be this for month now have be put to the leader of the house basic question about the incompetence of this government many different response be open to she she could have say agree with you she could have say do know will look into it will reply to you will ask ministerial colleague to investigate and respond or will come back to the house with proper account but on no occasion have she bother to give any kind of proper answer at all instead and fear the same will be true this week the leader of the house approach have be to change the subject and attack the previous government rather than defend the record of her government which be the whole point of these exchange let we see what she say when she stand up shortly if the government have make decent start of course she might want to talk about that but the truth be that the government have make dreadful start they have be beset by petty scandal from the beginning they have destroy business confidence through budget that be visibly unravel before our eye and only this week they have lose cabinet minister to new revelation about criminal conviction for fraud it be little wonder that the prime minister want reset the leader of the house unwillingness to engage and to recognise and respond to question be arguably more important than any aspect of policy because it strike at the heart of the very idea of our parliamentary democracy it be discourtesy indeed possibly even an insult to you mr speaker to all our colleague and their constituent and to this house it be make bad because the leader of the house be responsible for parliamentary business and procedure and should one might think set an example of openness it be bad still for two further reason because she herself have so often call for transparency from ministers and because failure to be accountable be itself breach of the rule of this house of the nolan principle and of the ministerial code of conduct that be quite combination so ask she whether she plan to continue as she have do or whether she will change this unfortunate habit and start to engage with the serious question that have be ask first put on record that tuesday be international day of persons with disabilities and note that the house of commons now have more disabled member than ever before commend their contribution and look forward to work with they through the modernisation committee and with you mr speaker to make sure that this place and our politic be as accessible as they can be as have be mention this saturday be small business saturday when we celebrate the heart of all our high street in these session like to hear about many of our constituent great cafés and in particular their bar especially when an invitation for to visit follow also put on record my thank to you mr speaker for the way proceeding be handle last friday and to all of those who take part in the debate on assist dying or be in the chamber for it that debate be respectful consider and thoughtful whatever view we each take it be moment when huge attention be on we and think our democracy and our parliament show itself at its good member will see that there be lot of important issue and much important business in the run up to christmas two third of the bills that we announce in our king speech be now make their way through parliament the rail franchising bill have receive royal assent the renters rights bill have complete committee and our important budget measure will soon be pass we be fix the foundation and get on with the job as have be note copy of the plan for change will be available in the vote office shortly ahead of the statement later today it be another week and another misjudged and confused contribution from the shadow leader of the house he really do need to work out what the conservative strategy for opposition be be it to tell people across the country that they never have it so good as when the conservatives be in office or to learn from defeat and accept that they get thing wrong gently advise they to listen to the voter because act as if they do nothing wrong and accept no responsibility will not do they any good at all if the right hon gentleman do not want to take my advice perhaps he should listen to his own because he say that the conservative suffer from many disastrous recent failure of policy and leadership and agree he say we inherit struggle economy and anaemic growth agree with that too also agree with he when he be champion of net zero and when he be financial secretary to the treasury he be right to care about economic stability agree with he do he still agree with he be not quite sure the right hon gentleman ask about scrutiny of legislation and debate but gently remind he that we have have many debate on the finance bill on the budget and the on the national insurance contribution bill which be come back to the house next week and before christmas must remind he yet again be afraid that he be financial secretary to the treasury when the national insurance contribution be raise not just on business but on worker he say that be thoroughly conservative thing to do he be also treasury minister when the minimum wage be raise he have have plenty of time to come to this house and explain why he think that be okay then but not okay now the right hon gentleman raise the topic of the economy but he fail to mention one of the big economic forecast out this week from the oecd which show that the uk be now forecast to be the fast grow european economy in the over the next three year he do not mention that when he be talk about the economy we have always be clear that growth only matter when ordinary people right around the country feel well off and see public service improve that be the difference between our economic plan and his we have plan for change the conservatives have yet to change they be yet to learn their own lesson we be lay out today how we will deliver our clear outcome the right hon gentleman might not like they because the conservatives fail on all their measure which be why they lose the election while he and the rest of his party shout from the sideline and try to rewrite history we be deliver the real change that the public vote for my right hon friend know that on occasion this house can come to agreement about key piece of legislation in the last parliament one such piece of legislation be the football governance bill will she give an update on its progress in this parliament and consider grant time for debate on the sustainability of football be really pleased and proud that this government have bring back strengthened football governance bill it be be consider in the house of lords the conservatives support it when they be in government but have to say that the behaviour of conservative peer in the house of lords do not suggest that the conservatives be still in favour of it because they have table hundred of amendment to slow down progress of that important bill if they still care about put fan back at the heart of our football and make sure that we have sustainable football industry in the future perhaps they should tell their colleague in the other place to pipe down call the liberal democrat spokesperson sadly it be difficult to deny that there have be many time in recent year when debate in this house have not be of the high quality when member have not show the public their good side and when dare say some have perhaps lose little of their sense of perspective as could be see in the way they conduct themselves but as the leader of the house have say the debate on the private member bill last friday be entirely different it be measure respectful and consider member listen carefully intervene with important and pertinent point and show british democracy at its good in short it be something to be extremely proud of regardless of whether we agree with the outcome or not party politic be largely keep out of that debate as mps be rightly give free vote vote of conscience on consequential topic free vote should surely be grant when we be debate issue that transcend party political boundary and surely there can be no issue more important than ensure that our planet be still able to support human life the climate and nature bill be crucial cross party bill promote by my hon friend the member for south cotswolds dr savage with support from parliamentarian include labour mp and sponsor by mp from six of the party that sit in the house indeed the bill be champion in the last parliament by the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and for sheffield hallam olivia blake and even understand by the right hon member for doncaster north ed miliband will the leader of the house ask the government to commit to free vote on that crucial bill second reading on january wholeheartedly agree with the hon member representation of the house last friday and how we really do show ourselves at our very good welcome the opportunity to work with she on the modernisation committee one thing we be look at be how to ensure that back benchers can come together more often in the interest of what our constituent want we to be talk about and in the public interest the hon member ask about the bill that will come before we early next year be not quite sure of its status but reassure she that the government be absolutely committed to be clean energy superpower by many in the conservative party now want to change the target but we be committed to they and to the benefit they will bring not just to tackle climate change but to create the job of the future and make sure that we have low bill and energy security for the long run in cross party spirit will say at this juncture that see that the leader of the liberal democrats christmas song be sure everyone will want to download it be rid high in the chart this week hope that it will not be the same as his paddle boarding which get off to great start and then fall flat on its face rise order can say to the house that hopefully with quick question and short answer we can get through want to make sure that we time the statement which be important to the house with the prime minister be aim for about past or quarter past let we

face up to the trade off involve govern be not just about what we want to do but about how we want to do it so we have to reform the state itself to deliver our goal that be why we want value for money and be crack down on fraud and waste through the new covid corruption commissioner that be why we will raise billion by go after tax avoider unlike the conservative party we be put in the money to make it happen that be why the chancellor demand efficiency and productivity saving of from each government department next year that be why we want to get more people off welfare and into work that be why we will tackle the delay and block in our planning system to make it fast to get thing build the old debate be just about government budget the new debate have to be about how those budget be use and about how people can be equip with the right technology and the right system to deliver so we will ask the follow question each time be power be devolve enough be technology be use enough be we learn enough from those on the frontline we will have more to say about reform of the state soon know there may be scepticism from those who first accuse we of be far too cautious and now accuse we of be far too ambitious but stop and think about what would happen if we do not set such goal politic need change when people have lose faith in its capacity to deliver and the government system itself need change to focus on the goal that we have set if we have just carry on in the same old pattern we would have too many child who be not ready to start school with opportunity cut off within the first few year of their life we would carry on with huge nhs waiting list which hurt both our people and our economy we would have more and more young people cut off from have home of their own and ask what all their effort and hard work will ever lead to we would continue with too many of our town centre be no go zone for people after dark we would still be at the mercy of dictator when it come to energy price perhaps most of all we would have an economy like the one the conservatives run in which living standard continue to stagnate just as they do in the last parliament if we do that the loss of faith would simply carry on it be not matter of whether we should do this we have to do this to stop the country fall behind and to meet the challenge that we face if we meet these goal we will have country where living standard be rise more child be ready for school few people be wait in pain for nhs treatment more people have the chance to have home of their home and our street be safe because we have the community police we need that be change worth have and change worth fight for and commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the right hon gentleman for advance sight of his statement it be very nice to receive it only hour after the times although must say that receive the policy document itself only at am unlike labour mps at pinewood studio who accord to social medium have the document some time before while the prime minister be at pinewood hope he will hear its owner concern about the very substantial increase in business rate from which will affect the profit and viability of what be under the conservatives flourish sector the opposition congratulate the government on their most recent reset there be only few more reset leave before christmas the labour party might want to try turn it off and well maybe just leave it off but it be good that it have take the time to come up with an emergency list of priority after only year in opposition and five month in power it have finally decide on some thing that it be go to work towards the statement be quite punchy about the past unusually punchy for the right hon gentleman if he be rattle and he be not the rattle type it be sign that the government must be feel pretty unstable at the moment labour member talk about legacy and wish they good fortune in government genuinely mean that the last government have to clean up the mess from the great financial crisis in century the last government have to deal with the big pandemic in century the last government have to deal with the big war in europe since interruption labour member might gloss over that they might pretend it be not important but history judge it very differently it reflect very badly on the labour party that it refuse to acknowledge the importance of those extremely significant event will now turn to each of the new millstone in order first raise living standard in every part of the united kingdom so that work people have more money in their pocket no matter where they live how be this to be measure what be the metric when will the datum be publish who will be hold to account we all need to know secondly build million home and fast track planning decision the office for budget responsibility have already say that this government be very unlikely to build more home than the last conservative government what have change since the budget why do the government now believe they will be able to achieve this be there more money have the spending plan change thirdly tackle hospital backlog we have already see funding first reform later disastrous way to do business nhs boss have be brief about this and they be already brief the press that this requirement will put enormous pressure on without additional money beyond that give at the budget be more money go to be make available for the nhs to fulfil this milestone fourthly police only of the neighbourhood police officer be extra new police officer this target be not genuine be there proposal to deal with the backlog in the court without that extra police officer will lead only to great backlog in the court do the labour party have plan for this fifthly energy in march labour mission document say that by the uk would be the first major country in the world to run on clean and cheap power since march this have be degrade by can we expect the target to be degrade by every nine month sixthly get child ready to learn this be genuinely wonderful target but what do the right hon gentleman mean by ready to learn how will it be measure when will the house be tell whether progress be be make obviously on all of these there be good thing to be do but the mission will only mean anything if the government be honest about what they be do and about the milestone they be hit or not hit also why have the government downgrade certain other priority how have they choose these six issue over immigration over gp surgery over over defence over the energy bill reduction target or over become the fast grow economy in the why have the government choose these priority the house should be tell finally who be take responsibility mean real responsibility for achieve the target lot of we be pleased when the other day the health secretary say that individual at the top of the health service would be hold accountable with their job if target be not hit will the same apply to ministers who in government be take real responsibility for the target if the government be serious we need datum accountability and transparency will the right hon gentleman guarantee to the house that we will get that have spend more of my life than would have like in opposition and learn one thing about be in opposition one have to decide what one attack be as listen to the hon gentleman be not sure whether he support or oppose the plan the hon gentleman refer to millstone let tell he very clearly the only millstone that this government and this country have be the appalling legacy leave by the conservatives let we contrast what we be announce today with their milestone of failure they have record high waiting list the bad parliament for living standard on record surrender on house building failure on infrastructure and billion hole in the public finance those be their milestone of failure these be our choice today the metric by which we measure thing be set out in the document before the house the target will make real difference to people life high living standard across the country more housing few people on nhs waiting list more community police and the good start in life for all child that final metric be already measure when child start school at the age of five under the hon gentleman government that metric fall so our plan be to raise that so that three out of four child can start school ready to learn that be the measure that we will choose the truth be that the conservatives could not tackle the challenge we have set out today and they know it they could not unblock the housing system or get the growth the country need because they be the one block the new housing and the infrastructure that we need they could not fix the school or the hospital or get more police on the street because they be still say that they support the investment while oppose any revenue measure that pay for it thereby sacrifice any reputation for economic competence that they have what contrast we will not subscribe to the fatalistic view that all we can look forward to be more of the kind of failure we see over the past year we believe in set out plan that will improve people life because we know that united government with clear sense of priority prepare to do the hard yard and make the difficult long term choice for the country can deliver well future for people that be what be set out in the plan we have publish today welcome my right hon friend plan for change which will ensure that the government be focus on delivery not the dither we have see for the past year with the conservatives especially welcome the nhs target of week the last labour government be able to deliver that target and nhs satisfaction level be at their high in history fourteen year of the conservatives run the nhs into the ground have leave it in an appalling state do my right hon friend agree with that that must never be allow to happen again absolutely agree with my hon friend when we come into office in we be also face with an nhs that be in severe difficulty let be clear with the house meet that target be extremely challenging but we believe that by set it and drive the system towards it we can make real progress towards reduce waiting list what contrast in term of what the public feel when we leave office in the public satisfaction rate with the nhs be the high ever record when we come back into office in july those satisfaction level be the low ever record that be what we be try to turn around through the plan we have publish today call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for advance sight of the statement this new government have follow the disaster of the previous conservative administration the conservatives break the nhs they crash the economy with the disastrous mini budget and they manage the staggering feat of deliver five prime ministers in six year it should not exactly be hard act to follow and yet too many people feel like this new government be still not listen to they when my colleague and speak to our constituent they simply can not comprehend decision such as the increase in national insurance which will hurt job just as we need to get the economy go the tax on family farm or the utterly misguided removal of the winter fuel payment the right hon gentleman will forgive therefore if approach today announcement with degree of scepticism new target be all well and good but people have hear lot of similar pledge and target before as they know all too well without proper plan for delivery they fail hope the government recognise that pursue the target at the expense of all the other thing leave break by the conservatives will not cut it the british public will not be take for fool on that point want to focus on the nhs yes bring down waiting list for treatment be crucial part of the picture but do so at the cost of neglect wait or the ability to see gp be like rob peter to pay paul we know that to fix the crisis in the nhs we must also fix the crisis in our care system indeed it be on fix health and care and deliver on the issue that people care about most that we on the liberal democrat benches will continue to hold the government to account when will we hear more detail about how the plan be to be deliver and particularly about spend allocation for the nhs to fix our hospital and reduce those waiting list welcome the question from the liberal democrat spokesperson she be right to point out the conservatives record but gently say that she too seem to support extra spending but oppose all the revenue raise measure that go towards that the truth be that if we be serious we can not do that the reason we have have to raise revenue be the appalling legacy that we inherit we have to stabilise the public finance and fix the situation we be leave with now that we have do that we can look forward to deliver on these key goal the hon lady ask how the plan be to be pay for there will be spending review next year as she know however we have already announce billion extra for the nhs over the next couple of year which be accompany by the reform that the secretary of state for health and social care have set out this labour government plan to make work pay will give thousand of worker in my constituency much need pay rise after year of failure by the conservative party do my right hon friend agree that plan to support low pay worker in insecure job will be not only crucial but absolutely central to our plan for change welcome what my hon friend say about pay the chancellor announce significant increase in the minimum wage at the time of the budget few week ago of course we want public sector worker and everybody who help to deliver plan to be reward well but it also have to come with change in the way the state work to make sure we get the good value for money and the good productivity and make the good use of technology we can not have that just in the private sphere we have to apply it to the public sphere to make sure we get the good bang for the taxpayer buck assure the right hon gentleman that do not think anybody doubt the sincerity of the new government in want to achieve these laudable aim remind he however of john lennon line life be what happen to you while you busy make other plan notably absent from the priority be one such as reduce the national debt or deal with the demographic challenge or the lack of defence and security that we need to build up to confront global challenge be these aim the government only priority or will we see big list that deal with some of the really existential challenge that threaten the independence and survival of our country welcome the hon member question he refer to defence and security do deliberately mention that area in my remark because it be an absolute foundation of any government that their first duty be to protect their people that be why there be specific section on it in the document and why it be an underpinning foundation for the goal that we have set out today listen carefully to the shadow minister reply and it sound to like he welcome much of the investment that our government will deliver but funnily enough he will not support any measure to pay for it be always teach that the tories be against something for nothing culture do my right hon friend agree that this will only compound the tories reputation for economic recklessness do think the tories have problem the new leader of the opposition stand at that dispatch box couple of week ago and say that she support all the extra investment therefore every time the opposition stand up and oppose the revenue measure that be design to fund they all they do be expose their own economic incoherence it be quite simple if the opposition support the investment they have either to support the revenue measure that we have set out or set out alternative revenue raise measure to meet the investment that they support so far they have utterly fail to do that five month in and after budget that the office for budget responsibility say will lower growth over five year increase inflation and reduce the number of people in job it be extraordinary to see document that have so many area not cover want to probe the right hon gentleman specifically on his goal of increase disposable income for work people what would he say to those terminally ill old people who in shocking news last week from marie curie will not get their winter fuel allowance this year will he be judge by his governance action every government be judge by their action and by the legacy that they leave to their successor we have to take that decision on winter fuel precisely because of the legacy that be leave to we we do want to see rise in people living standard and in their disposable income those stagnate under the previous government and let we not forget how unusual that be this be the first parliament in live memory that see stagnate living standard across the whole population we aim to change that and make sure that people see rise living standard wherever they live in the country when be child in denton holme in carlisle pc kevin scott be very familiar figure he know we and we know his name do the minister agree that not only do society exist but it be weave from thousand of community such as denton holme and that our commitment to reintroduce name community police officer will strengthen those community strengthen society and take back our street my hon friend be right let praise pc kevin scott and other officer like he who be know in the community while be here madam deputy speaker let mention kenny our police community support officer on bilston high street who help to keep we safe we want to see more name officer like that so that people know who be keep their street safe and can put face to the name and we can restore proper community police to make our street and our town centre safe however the minister try to dress this up there be an unmistakeable whiff of panic about it one would have think that decade and half of opposition would have be ample time to prepare plan for change rather than the relaunch of government whose five year plan seem to have unravel after just five month be particularly interested however to hear about the government commitment to reform of the state he say that each time they will ask be power be devolve enough give that the scottish government have ask for power on migration employment law and the constitution to be devolve when can we expect to see some action on that reform of the state and that important commitment to devolution the hon member call this relaunch hate to break it to he but the government he support in scotland produce programme for government every single year do that mean that they relaunch every year or do he put that accusation only to we he ask about devolution we be the party that create devolution because we believe in powerful scottish parliament we still do and it have just receive its big real term increase in funding since devolution come into being he miss out his thank to the labour chancellor who make that happen welcome today statement which be real plan for change and hope it be clear that the conservatives do not like we talk about their record but it have real world impact in constituency such as mine particularly when it come to bobby on the beat for year the conservatives strip we of bobby on the beat and as my hon friend the member for carlisle ms minns say neighbourhood policing be strip out of many local community particularly welcome the requirement in today plan for more neighbourhood policing which will have real world impact on my constituent my hon friend be absolutely right we see huge cut in the number of police officer after the conservative party come to power which really affect the neighbourhood community police team that we have set up during our period in government we want to ensure that there be proper neighbourhood policing team in every community with name officer so that people can feel safe on their street and in their community that absolutely underpin our quality of life there be no freedom if people do not feel safe which be why it be such core part of the plan that we have produce today welcome the minister commitment to revitalise faith in democratic politic and agree that government can be force for good but he will know that perhaps the big macroeconomic challenge that we face be productivity indeed he mention it today be therefore disappointed to see in the plan no real mention of force skill or national economic resilience in term of grow more of the food that we eat and make more of the good that we need will he look at those two area and set productivity target for which ministers can be hold accountable so that what really count be not just what we spend but what we get for what we spend the right hon member might have notice that say in my opening remark that an old debate just about the size of the budget be not enough for the situation that we face of course budget resource and investment matter but so too do reform of the way the state work the application of technology and the balance between what be do centrally and what be do in devolve area alongside any delivery goal there have to be real plan to make they happen that reform the state be clear that that must go alongside the goal that we have set out today waiting list on the nhs have already be mention but they need to be mention again because the last year have make such difference to constituent in truro and falmouth they have really struggle to work and to live have to wait one or two year for orthopaedic operation please will my right hon friend speak again about what have already be do to deal with those waiting list and how that will lead into the future this be hugely important problem for the country because the current level be not just bad for those wait long time for nhs treatment they be also bad for the economy because we have so many people in that position that number have start to fall slightly since we come into office but it will take long and sustained effort and combination of investment and reform be glad that we be able to announce the big increase in nhs funding since outside the pandemic period but that have to be use in way that get waiting list down help the people wait for nhs treatment and crucially help produce the economic growth and productivity we need the truth be too many people be wait in pain and too many people of working age be out of work on long term sickness benefit and we have to do something about both those thing if we be to meet our economic growth target and get the rise living standard we want to see in the document the government have downgrade their pledge to have the fast grow economy in the and junk their pledge to cut energy bill by break two promise to the british people of the milestone they be keep who be accountable for each one what be the detailed metric where be the implementation plan and will ministers take responsibility if they fail to meet they if the hon member read the document carefully he will see that the growth target be very much in the document but the document also say that it be not enough just to have economic growth people have to feel it in their standard of living that should be an important lesson for all of we in politic the hon member challenge on accountability of course the target be challenge but let we look at the alternative we be not prepared to carry on with the thinking that announcement be something real with no real focus on delivery and drive the system in case he have not notice there be crisis of faith in politic out there we have set out target today that will make real difference to people life accept that they be challenge but if we have few people wait in pain more people able to own their own home safe street and well chance in life for child start school that be change worth have and that be why we publish the plan welcome the statement harlow be town plague by low pay and insecure work and people be force out of work due to wait for operation will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster describe how the plan will help tackle those issue for resident in my town gently say to the conservatives when they talk about metric that they be the party that criticise school during their tenure because apparently half the school be below average my hon friend be right that when people do the right thing and they go out to work and try to earn living they should have decent reward for what they do that be why labour introduce the concept of national minimum wage in the first place oppose by the conservatives who say it would destroy job and why the chancellor announce at the recent budget significant increase in that wage so that when people do the right thing they be reward and can get decent living for the hard work they do flexible affordable childcare be critical part of our economic infrastructure it give parent more choice over how to organise their life and it help they return to work if they want to as well as give child good start in life yet nursery in marple in my hazel grove constituency have tell that the government increase in national insurance charge will force they to increase cost to family the government rightly say they be serious about fix early year provision and tackle the attainment gap for disadvantaged child so do they plan to exempt early year and nursery setting from their ill advise hike to national insurance charge if the hon member look at the document she will find that an expansion of nursery place be in it because we know it be good for child and for work parent that be part of the plan we set out today and part of our plan to ensure that child in early year have the good possible start in life can not announce anything far to the budget on national insurance but she know the background to why we have to take those decision listen to conservative members one would think we be leave golden legacy despite that halcyon legacy it be no wonder the conservatives be resoundingly beat in the last election my constituent want an nhs that can be rely on yet lord darzi report be clear that we have not sort out the health service or social care indeed of nhs bed be take up by people who could be in social care will the minister outline what he will do to ensure that we finally get to grip with that crucial issue the legacy of the conservative government be not just economic or in policy but loss of faith in government ability to do thing that be part of the backdrop to the plan that we be publish today commend lord darzi report to anyone who have not read it it fully set out the legacy in health we have put get waiting list down at the heart of the plan that we be publish today because that drive the whole system if we get they down we will have healthy population more people ready to work more people to contribute to the country and more people to contribute to our productivity that be why it be at the heart of the plan thank the right hon gentleman for take the time to come to the house to set out where the milestone be that be positive move for government to make in order to give clarity however it would also be incredibly helpful if he set out how he will keep the house update perhaps on six monthly basis to track the plan development and the government delivery of it there be long time until the next general election so it would be good to see how the plan be progress throughout this parliament welcome the right hon gentleman welcome for the plan which stand in mark contrast to the scepticism show by his party front benchers he will have plenty of opportunity now that we have publish the plan to ask ministers about these thing as we move forward we know that they will be challenge to deliver we have not yet follow the advice of the hon member for argyll bute and south lochaber brendan who suggest that we do this every year but be sure that the ministers in charge of these goal will keep the house regularly update my constituency see the high price rise in the country back in august as direct result of the conservatives opposition to build the house that be clearly so desperately want and need in my constituency can the minister assure young people in my constituency who be desperate to buy their own home start family and get on with their life that labour will deliver for they build more house be challenging thing to do because there be always people who will object and blockage in our planning system and thing take too long we have major planning and infrastructure bill come in the new year that aim to unblock some of that we know that the target be challenge but we must build more house in this country and not just house but more infrastructure in order to get the economic growth that we need it take too long for major investment to happen look forward to the conservative party support for our planning and infrastructure bill when it be introduce in the new year the conservative government brough the nhs to its knee theirs be legacy of crumble hospital of doctor and nurse work at burnout and of patient be treat in corridor the liberal democrats welcome the extra investment in the nhs and support the ambition to get waiting list down but the government can not fix the nhs without first fix social care at winchester hospital part of the hampshire hospitals nhs foundation trust almost one in five bed be fill by someone who could be care for through the social care package but be stick in hospital bed that have the knock on effect of increase and ambulance waiting time and of elective surgery be cancel will the government review the national insurance increase for social care provider and hospice and will they commit to cross party talk so that we can have long term plan to fix social care thank the hon gentleman for his question but there be contradiction at the heart of it he begin by say he welcome the extra investment in the nhs and end by say he oppose the national insurance increase that be necessary to fund these thing as have say before people can not support the extra investment we have announce but oppose every revenue raise measure that contribute to it it simply do not work like that if we want the extra investment we have to support the revenue raise measure that make it possible the plan for change be clear this government will restore order to the asylum and immigration system clear the asylum backlog end the use of hotel increase return and cut small boat crossing do the minister agree that this plan stand in stark contrast to the open border policy that the conservative party subject the country to it be strike that when the conservatives come into power they begin by promise to reduce net migration to under and bequeath we situation where that figure be time high this happen on their watch with their policy and now we be leave to clear up the situation and restore some order to our migration policy the country will always need migration but the plan for change document set out what my hon friend say we will reduce net migration and deal with illegal migration in the way she set out be very pleased to read that labour drive be for the work man and woman that have to be welcome and very much welcome the billion for the nhs it would be churlish of or of anyone in the house not to do so however the budget put question mark over the viability of work farm it strip pensioner of their winter fuel allowance and put what could possibly be unsustainable pressure on of microbusinesse and small business in northern ireland that be not help the work man or the work woman everybody in this house want the labour party to succeed for the sake of the country and for its people actually might want it more than most if can say that once again ask whether the government will have the strength to acknowledge and put right the wrong call that have be make to lead this great nation successfully to prosperity with no pensioner small business or family farm leave behind appreciate the spirit in which the hon member have ask his question on farm as the chancellor make clear couple would have an allowance of million before any inheritance obligation kick in and then it would be at half the rate that other people have to pay so significant protection be build into the policy on pensioner it be very important to remember that we have say we will protect the triple lock which be reflect in the pension increase that have be announce for next year after year of repeat break promise it be hardly surprising that many people be distrustful of politician and the ability of government to do anything positive do the minister agree that in set out clear plan for change the government be offer the british people not just the hope of well future but clear measurable metric against which they can be hold to account this question of distrust and loss of faith be really important because after so much chaos in recent year it be very easy for our constituent to turn off from politic to think that no government of any political colour can deliver for they we be determine not to allow that scepticism to set in and become the norm so we have set out target acknowledge not for the first time today that those target be challenge they be not easy to meet but progress towards they with low waiting time more house build and the other thing set out in the plan for change document will show that the government be try to deliver for people and that politic can bring productive change that be change worth have like my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson welcome these milestone and agree with what the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster say about the need to restore trust how will labour health policy in england differ from those that they pursue in wales be sure that in every part of the country government who run the nhs want to see waiting list fall we put that at the heart of the plan for change today because it drive the whole system and because the level of satisfaction with the nhs that we inherit be the low ever record no government can be content with that can tell the right hon gentleman honestly that no labour government be content with it that be why it be an important part of the plan in west brom one issue dominate all else the fact that people be work hard and hard but can afford less and less that be the record of the conservative party who crash our economy and oversee the bad cost of live crisis in generation can my right hon friend set out how the plan for change will make ordinary people well off and deliver exactly what people vote for in july very much welcome that question from my parliamentary neighbour we represent very similar community and agree that when people go out to work and do the right thing they want to be reward rightly that be why we protect people payslip in the budget it be why we announce an increase in the minimum wage in the budget it be why we make sure in the budget that carer could earn more before lose part of their revenue we want work to be reward we be the labour party we be the party of labour when people do the right thing they should be treat fairly the conservatives have always claim to be the party of law and order but they take police officer off the street knife and youth crime antisocial behaviour and local drug activity be some of the most common complaint in my constituency welcome the labour government urgent action to recruit more neighbourhood police officer my right hon friend know my constituency well because it adjoin his in wolverhampton can he confirm that this action will make real difference to my constituent welcome the question from my parliamentary neighbour on the other side of my constituency he be right that people in his constituency and mine care deeply about the safety of their community they see the cut in police after the conservative party come to power they see their neighbourhood officer be more and more stretched try to cover more and more area with not enough officer it be really important to restore sense of community police so that people feel safe in their community and on their street because that underpin the freedom that people need to live their life thank my right hon friend for his statement when these achievement be reach the impact on community like mine will be profound for too long people have be tell that government do not work they need to understand that when government be do well it can and will work do my right hon friend agree that the british people need these milestone for progress after year of milestone of failure my hon friend make very good point as say in my statement let we consider what the situation would be if we do not do these thing we would just carry on with the situation that we have in which for example young people work hard and hard and think how will ever get home of my own and people wait for nhs treatment be tell that they might have to wait for month or two year that be too long to wait for treatment that be why we put those thing at the heart of the document today it will make real difference to people life if we manage to meet the milestone they be challenge but do this can help drive the system and ensure progress towards our goal the nhs have long be top issue raise by local resident when have be out knock on door across the whole of filton and bradley stoke so welcome not only the investment but the reform alongside that and these clear milestone for change which be what the country vote to see will the minister give commitment on behalf of the government that no matter the lack of support from the conservative party he will persevere with this as that be what the country want can give my hon friend that commitment and can assure she of the passion that the secretary of state for health and social care feel for this goal for turn around the system and for reduce waiting list and waiting time he know how important that be for patient and for our goal of grow the economy and that be why the goal be part of the document welcome each and every one of the milestone and the real tangible difference that they will make to the life of my resident in rossendale and darwen each be crucial step in the process of mission delivery also welcome the recognition that to get they meet we need to do government differently devolution and move away from command and control government represent real opportunity to enable more effective and efficient delivery and perhaps even restore some of the trust in politic that be so broken and destroy by the conservative party in lancashire we have be hold back by an outdated two tier local government system do the minister agree that it be time for lancashire leader to come together to grasp the huge opportunity that devolution offer as say if the goal be to be reach it will require reform of the state itself and part of that be about local delivery there have be lot of innovation in recent year we start devolution when we be last in power and the conservative party take it forward with the creation of number of mayor around the country there be furth to go with that have mayor and strong local leader as partner can really help we to deliver the goal set out in the document welcome the minister statement he have set out concrete deliverable and measurable milestone against which the british public can judge we what stark contrast to conservative front bench members who still refuse even to acknowledge the liz truss economic disaster that be the mini budget and to apologise for it do my right hon friend agree that any sort of turn that see the conservatives back our step to restore economic stability be unlikely and that they will continue to cling to the idea of the magic money tree the conservatives do deliver some thing they deliver huge economic crash bank of england intervention in order to prop up the pension system and significant increase in mortgage rate which people be still pay today the most important thing about defeat be to learn from it and have to say from observe the conservative party that they be not yet do that the legacy of year of the conservatives in government and century of tory complacency in hexham be see in how police number in prudhoe fall under the last government and indeed in callerton and throckley they have also fall in our most rural community rural crime be unfortunately bring up with regularly that be an example of how the conservative party have fail to understand the modern countryside will the minister outline how this plan will make measurable change for our rural community as well as town like prudhoe the goal in this document can make real difference to rural community we know that many people in rural community be worried about rural crime so more neighbourhood policing can help they we also know that many young people in rural community be wonder how they will ever have home of their own that be why we support more house building as well as short hospital waiting list and neighbourhood police team as set out in the document be the last member to be call but will try not to take too long welcome the scale of the ambition in the secretary of state statement but challenge what he say about there be only one millstone in the uk my resident in edinburgh south west increasingly feel hold back by our incoherent scottish government yesterday be fine example of that in the scottish parliament the snp government set their budget one largely fund by the hard work of scottish labour mp in this place who secure the big ever settlement for scotland meanwhile snp mps in this place vote against our money raise measure they want to eat their cake and have it order supplementary question should be short and not speech perhaps the hon member would like to come to the conclusion of his question thank you madam deputy speaker it be always good to be guide by you the secretary of state set out how living standard will increase right across the uk and scotland be part of that how will he work with the scottish government and the incoherent snp government to do that my hon friend be absolutely right to point out that the recent devolution financial settlement be the big in real term since devolution be introduce as consequence of the announcement make by the labour chancellor at the budget that provide the funding and it be completely incoherent to welcome that funding in fact to run around say that it will be spend on this and that but then to vote against the revenue measure that contribute to it if we want increase investment and boost service we must support the revenue raise measure that make that possible and then we have to combine investment with the reform necessary to deliver that be the next step detain british nationals abroad beg to move that this house be concern by the number of arbitrarily detain british national at risk of human right abuse abroad and the apparent lack of active support for those detain and call on the foreign commonwealth and development office to provide regular report on when it last raise the case of those people with its international counterpart be enormously pleased that the backbench business committee agree to find sufficient time to debate this issue too often the issue of british citizen detain abroad get wash away in all the other debate no matter who be in government as have say before regardless of who be sit on the government benches be they conservative labour or whatever tend to find myself in opposition on issue such as this as do many member here we have serious concern that the issue be not raise enough and case be lock behind wall of silence want to change that today my intention be to call on the government first of all to provide regular report something they never do on when the foreign commonwealth and development office last raise the case of british national who be arbitrarily detain abroad and at risk of human right abuse individual detain abroad be particularly vulnerable to torture ill treatment and other serious human right violation from the moment that they be detain at least uk national be torture or ill treat abroad every year in the fcdo receive new allegation of torture and mistreatment from british national overseas it go on and on arbitrary detention and hostage taking be devastating but be practise by number of regime chief among those be iran that be devastating for the individual affect and their family survivor bear the physical psychological and socioeconomic scar of their captivity survivor family also endure significant psychological distress often face vicarious trauma as they fight for their love one release and feeling that they be fight lose battle against even the establishment here in the united kingdom the support that the british government can provide to their national in these harrowing circumstance be crucial they be sometimes the only link between the individual and the outside world the right hon member mention support from the british government do he agree that that support be not always as consistent across the globe as we might like and as many member of the public would imagine it to be there be no guarantee or legal right impose on the uk government to do it in the way that there be for example on the american government do he think that the situation be unsatisfactory and if so what do he think the government should do about it completely agree have no problem agree on this matter it have be long stand issue for family and member of parliament that somehow the fcdo put cloud of obscurity in the way of real knowledge about what be go on for family that can be incredibly difficult the right hon member may be aware of the case of alaa abd el fattah british national who remain in an egyptian prison like be he very concerned that mr el fattah mother laila soueif who be year old be now on the day of hunger strike as understand it the foreign secretary last raise the case on november do the right hon member agree that more need to be do beyond just raise the case absolutely agree that case will be raise today all of we who want to speak in the debate have agree that we will make sure that individual case be raise in detail will touch on some to summarise they and will detail couple of they the hon lady be quite right what have happen be appal and we need to ensure that more be do that be critical those who fall prey to detention be too often let down by british government say without let or hindrance that that include the conservative government who be in office previously the labour governments before that and the present labour government hope that will now change the foreign secretary recently confirm that there be prisoner in the system yet the foreign office refuse to disclose exactly how many be british national who be be arbitrarily detain why not what be so ground shake about discover who the british national be for goodness sake hope the minister will agree that it be essential that the government publish datum on the number of british citizen who be arbitrarily detain or hold hostage abroad sadly there be british national in arbitrary detention in repressive country all over the world quite often we be not aware of they as say in response to the hon lady those case will be raise with your indulgence madam deputy speaker remind the house that family member be watch this debate from the gallery will quickly name they if that be all right with everyone here we be join by omar robert hamilton alaa abd el fattah cousin and sanaa seif alaa sister we be join by supporter and family member of ryan cornelius be deeply sorry that ryan wife heather cornelius be unable to join we today but ryan brother in law chris pagett and his wife diana be with we as well as ryan sister in law wendy thompson and her husband david also sit in the gallery be matthew hedges victim of arbitrary detention in the united arab emirates and peter humphrey former prisoner of china too often family feel that they be fight two battle one against the foreign state that have detain their love one and another against the uk government who do not seem to prioritise the case be deeply sorry that that should be the case and today debate be about hopefully sow the seed of change the right hon member mention the family who be here today to listen to this debate and in do so highlight the impact on not just those detain or hold hostage but their loved one friend and family take the opportunity to invite he to recognise the family and friend of british link hostage hold in gaza oded lifschitz eli sharabi avinatan or and emily damari and their case be go to say it but as the hon member have raise it will do so now we must not forget those hostage what have happen to they be appal and he be right to raise it family across the uk listen to this debate will be appreciative of that critical issue be the lack of clear and proactive response strategy from the fcdo there be no centralised approach for deal with arbitrary detention case and that absence of structure add to the stress for family who feel unsupported and often ignore my right hon friend point be surely the critical one traditionally the good and the bright go into the diplomatic service and the foreign office intake but even the bright people need to specialise if they be to do good job give that so many people be be detain in this way surely the answer be to have small dedicated unit within the foreign office that can handle the co ordination of systematic response every time someone be arbitrarily detain abroad agree with my right hon friend the point be really get at be that the day of the shift job of generalist be long go be afraid have often make the case have run department that the civil service and the foreign office need to catch up with what be happen outside we need specialist in place and we need that to be consider an important job in case where british national be detain abroad the family of those detain have often find the uk government reluctant to act to prevent torture or to seek accountability where it occur if they be act they do not relay that to the family so the family be leave believe that nothing have happen even if something have happen for instance when nazanin zaghari ratcliffe british iranian dual citizen be detain in iran her family first raise allegation of torture with the fcdo in it be not until may follow outside pressure from redress and other by way of submission to the fcdo of medical report as evidence of her severe suffering that the then foreign secretary dominic raab an old colleague of ours acknowledge that she have be victim of torture why do it take so long it seem to that this be pointless in the case of jagtar singh johal british national torture by police in india fcdo official would only raise the allegation of torture with the indian authority once they have seek consent from he directly which take two to three month know that the hon member for west dunbartonshire douglas mcallister intend to speak about that case but just raise it generally as an illustration of what be go wrong family of detainee face significant challenge in their engagement with the fcdo many report vague or inconsistent communication which breed mistrust there be critical need for designate point of contact for family as happen in the states to ensure transparency and accountability in the handling of case without that family feel abandon by their own government while simultaneously battle the detaining state with few tool the fcdo also lack consistent policy on the treatment of dual national often cite state refusal to recognise dual nationality as barrier to action that be practical challenge not legal one and it should not stop uk official from attempt to access prison or court when the government fail to act it risk send damaging message to dual national that they be less british and by extension less deserving of protection for instance that reasoning be use very much in the case of jimmy lai who be british citizen china decide because it do not recognise dual nationality to call he dual national he have never be dual national and have lose count of the number of time that have literally shout at government ministers in westminster hall that he be not dual national when they get up to speak they just say that he be dual national he have never be dual national he be proud british citizen he get into hong kong long before he be of an age to have nationality in that sense or passport he have be british national non stop since then do the right hon gentleman agree that it do not matter whether someone be dual national or not if they be british they be british and they be proud to be british we should simply talk about they be british citizen and not even bother talk about dual national could not agree more with the right hon lady and welcome she to the debate as chair of the foreign affairs committee she be absolutely right but the problem in this case be that dual nationality be use as an excuse for why the government do not want to raise the matter because china do not recognise that british citizenship she be right that if someone be british citizen they be british citizen and the inside of the passport tell we why that be important it seem to be ignore too often we know that sanction be vital tool for deter and punish state actor involve in arbitrary detention yet that tool be often underutilise by uk governments will touch on that later because compare with the americans we fail to utilise it as possible way to leverage change to what be go on outside another area of concern be the inconsistent application of government policy regard international legal standard when the minister come to the dispatch box will he confirm the government official definition of arbitrary detention how do it align with international legal standard such as those establish by the united nations working group on arbitrary detention have never be able to get an answer out of any foreign minister yet but ask he give his experience in the department to kindly find out the definition for we and let we know say would raise specific case so will run through some of the list ryan cornelius be british citizen unjustly detain in dubai for more than year originally in isolation his case represent an egregious violation of human right and importantly of due process he be arrest in on false fraud allegation relate to million dubai islamic bank loan and his year sentence be extend by year in through retroactive application of new law without proper legal proceeding the bank seize asset worth billion from mr cornelius far exceed the original loan amount the un working group on arbitrary detention have rule categorically that ryan detention be arbitrary and in violation of international law call for his immediate release and compensation however there still appear to be fcdo resistance mohammed ibrahim al shaibani become dib chairman shortly before mr cornelius arrest he appear to have orchestrate mr cornelius continue detention and the asset seizure mr al shaibani hold influential position in dubai government indicate an abuse of power mr cornelius be now and have suffer severe health issue in prison include tuberculosis that go untreated for month meanwhile his seized property originally claim to be worthless by the bank be now be redevelop as luxury project call the acres worth strangely billion under the last government raise mr cornelius case finally with the former prime minister lord cameron while he be foreign secretary subsequently he engage personally in seek clemency for mr cornelius he meet the family raise the case with the uae foreign minister and write personally to the ruler of dubai that be first because everybody else seem to have shy away from this one not want to upset the uae it appear to be fair to lord cameron he get the issue and he start to tackle it and that be important the present foreign secretary who replace lord cameron in july fail to raise mr cornelius case in his recent visit to the uae in september which perplex give that it have already be raise that just encourage country like the uae to carry on and to double down do not understand why in response to my write question to the foreign secretary receive this answer the foreign secretary raise the importance of consular issue although not this specific case during his visit to the uae on september and first meeting with foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed understand that on sunday the prime minister be expect to visit the uae and think saudi arabia will the minister make it clear to the prime minister believe this be the view that will be express in this debate that he must not only raise the case which be important but demand categorically that ryan cornelius be release into the hand of his family without delay hope that whatever be summarise from his meeting that specific issue be there in black and white for this house to record the hon member for macclesfield tim roca raise mr cornelius case several week ago in an adjournment debate when he be reassure by the minister for development the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds that the case will continue to be raise with the uae report november vol and yet it be not if minister give assurance in this house madam deputy speaker do you not agree that they should actually back up those assurance wonder if the minister present will explain why that be the case although individual case be raise with international counterpart often no concrete action follow hope the minister agree that once case be raise it will be follow up in mr cornelius case believe the path could culminate in sanction so there be process it be clear that raise the case with the uae authority have yet to produce result what we want be real record that the authority be now be warn that should they fail to take action individual sanction under the magnitsky rule will follow will the minister therefore now look to impose target magnitsky sanction on those responsible for mr cornelius arbitrary detention and asset seizure there be number of they his excellency mohammed al shaibani who be the chairman of the dib yahya saeed ahmad nasser lootah the vice chairman of the board of director hamad abdulla rashe obaid al shamsi who be board member ahmad mohammad saeed bin humaidan board member abdul aziz ahmed rahma mohamed al muhairi board member dr hamad buamim board member javier marin romano board member bader saeed abdulla hareb al mheiri board member and dr cigdem kogar board member all be involve in this case all be eligible for magnitsky sanction mr cornelius should now be release immediately or sanction believe should follow will deal reasonably quickly with the case of jimmy lai and then will give way to other in the debate jimmy lai be renowned pro democracy campaigner journalist and medium owner wear the badge to free he with pride this man have be treat abominably he be hero and we should recognise that he be and proud british citizen he be also catholic and have be deny the normal communion that he would expect as believer in catholicism it have be shut off from he for long time which matter great deal to he he be prisoner of conscience he could have flee hong kong after the sino british agreement be trash but he choose to stay why he want to set an example for the many who could not flee and who be go to be arrest that he be not go to run away just because he have money this be brave man mr lai be currently on trial in hong kong for alleged offence against national security and alleged sedition say to arise out of his work as newspaper publisher and his pro democracy activism his case be emblematic of the crackdown on the medium in hong kong civil society and the rule of law on november the united nations working group on arbitrary detention publish its opinion that jimmy lai be be unlawfully and arbitrarily detain and call for his immediate release the work group find multiple violation of mr lai right and freedom express alarm at his prolong detention in solitary confinement and stress that he should not be on trial at all this case say to the minister be very urgent mr lai have be arbitrarily detain in prolong solitary confinement for nearly four year often in insufferable heat during the summer month secure jimmy lai release require effective action across the government to bring he home and reunite he with his family in london at the moment he be bravely give evidence in his trial at which by the way number of members present have be name have be apparently name be already sanction by the chinese but have also be name as be party to the case be bring against he have to say publicly that have sadly never meet jimmy lai or correspond with he wish that have wish that could tell he what brave man he really be hon member hear hear will the minister outline today what urgent step the foreign office be take to secure jimmy lai release remind the minister and other that what we see in front of we now be rise in hostage take by nation state the big abuser of this process be of course iran worry about this abuse grow more and more in iran in january we must not forget about this iran execute british iranian national alireza akbari who be arrest charge and execute on spy charge which he deny and which be totally untrue it be the first execution of dual national since the only four month later the iranian authority execute second dual national swedish iranian habib chaab in october it execute third dual national german iranian jamshid sharmahd at least one more dual national swedish iranian ahmad reza djalia have be sentence to death since conclude on the simple basis as raise at the beginning that we can no long go along with the idea that we somehow lose influence if we raise these case publicly we can no long go on with this idea that we can manage generalist approach to this in the foreign office as have already be raise we need much more professional deliberate and permanent status in the department to deal with this matter finally we have in our hand the magnitsky sanction legislation with the case of ryan cornelius and other it be high time that those who be party to the arrest and incarceration of innocent british citizen find themselves face magnitsky sanction unless they recant and that individual be release that at least give we tool ask the government to get to the dispatch box when the time come and commit to that process call the chair of the foreign affairs committee thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure today incredibly important debate and the backbench business committee for allow we the time to debate it throughout my time in parliament have see far too many sad and desperate family protest outside the foreign office go on hunger strike stand for election against the prime minister as one of my constituent do in support of andy tsege sing christmas carol as do outside the foreign office in support of nazanin zaghari ratcliffe and organise petition they do everything they can to get their love one back believe rightly or wrongly that the foreign office genuinely do not seem to be do enough and do not seem to care the public understandably have huge amount of sympathy for these individual and for the family of those who have be arrest and believe the standing of the foreign office be undermine as result we be tell that the foreign office do everything it can but it need to do most of that quietly and behind closed door and the difficulty be that it be hard for some family to see the difference between do nothing and perhaps do great deal that be the dilemma when those family see detain people from other country be release whether those be canadians americans french or germans and the brits be not they do wonder whether it be because the foreign office be simply not do its job properly that be the issue the minister will be assure that do not want to spend all the time have in this debate just moan about the foreign office have some positive suggestion which hope will be take seriously because believe that this be an issue on which we could do much well there be some idea that be currently circulate and they be not all mine be steal other people idea and try to put they together in order genuinely to try to help the first of those idea be that we have to put this in context there be now many more brit travel all over the world and go to all sort of place the number be go up all the time and that be to be encourage of course while more brit be travel around the world we be also in world where few and few country pay much attention to anything that might be see in any sense as any form of rule of law so brits get themselves into terrible trouble and some of they be arbitrarily detain as say be steal other people idea so want genuinely to compliment the previous member of the foreign affairs committee the problem of arbitrary detention and how to solve people be detain abroad be complex and case that many people have work on so the work of the previous select committee very ably chair by the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns need to be mention in dispatch be proud to be the second female chair of the foreign affairs committee hope that my committee can meet the standard set by the hon lady the previous committee report on state hostage taking make recommendation which have they be implement by the previous government would have be very effective in case that have be raise today chief among they be the recommendation to formalise and publish the criterion for determine whether the detention of british national by foreign state be consider arbitrary and the recommendation to establish senior position in the foreign office solely commit to arbitrary and complex detention there be example of criterion the united nations have criterion and the americans have criterion they be different criterion but they be very interesting and certainly hope there be someone in the foreign office at this moment look at potential criterion and look to draft some agree with the right hon member for chingford and woodford green that it be about time we have establish criterion so there be little more transparency on this issue it be very disappointing that number of the previous government foreign secretaries disregard and kick into the long grass the recommendation set out by the committee it do not have to be that way be encourage that the labour party have since october last year be committed to have special envoy for uk citizen seize abroad last week in front of my committee with sebastien lai and sanaa seif sit behind he my right hon friend the foreign secretary reconfirm his commitment to that be encourage to see that the labour manifesto go far than the previous foreign affair committee recommendation on consular access labour pledge to ensure the legal right to consular access and certainly hope the government will deliver on that but we must act quickly because the like of alaa and jimmy and their family can not and should not have to wait any long therefore call on the government to be clear in their timeline for implement those promise have think about that and have meet family of number of those detain think we should institute an office in the foreign office that be commit to arbitrary detention which establish proper criterion for categorise someone as wrongfully detain as soon as someone be arrest the local consular office should inform the foreign office which should apply the criterion to the case and make recommendation to the foreign secretary it would then be up to the foreign secretary to decide whether that case would be give the benefit of the special envoy who would then take leadership of the case there will not be many of they but those determine as victim of arbitrary detention will be very special case and will have the sort of resource and focus that they need and deserve it will be the job of the envoy to get their prisoner out first and foremost use all the lever of the state they should be give permission to think laterally and be creative and to think of every way we can ensure we get our british citizen out it will also be their job to keep in close active and respectful contact with the family so that they know what be go on know that number of people have concern have hear the counter argument and understand they but if we look at what the americans be do many of those concern may be allay let we look at what be go on at the moment in the united states be grateful to the official from the united states office of the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs who speak with at some length yesterday find the conversation have with they as enlightening as do inspire want to go into that in some depth because want to enlighten and inspire member who be listen to the debate today so that they will agree with and continue to put pressure on the foreign office to get on with thing the office be base in the us state department it deal with about to wrongful detention case year as well as the more black and white case of us citizen take hostage by the like of isis the office be responsible in collaboration with other departments for make recommendation on the basis of criterion on whether an individual detention be arbitrary the recommendation be make to the secretary of state who remain responsible for sign off each individual case it be civil servant lead unit that apply the criterion but with ministerial oversight the team be about people there be expert in negotiation expert on specific region and expert in support family within those team be people whose sole role be family engagement include train psychologist in much the same way as the police in this country where victim of crime will have dedicated family liaison officer in really serious case one main function of the office be to support the family in our discussion yesterday they tell that within hour of us citizen be categorise as wrongfully detain the special envoy call the family of the individual to introduce themselves and explain the next step the envoy or his staff then remain the direct contact with family member provide they with regular update and answer question they may have include answer the phone at eleven at night to calm down parent who fear they will never see their child again we need to do thing well the foreign office communication with family be not good in my belief it be clearly inadequate as laila soueif tell the medium she think she be be ignore by the foreign secretary since he have take up the post should make it clear that be glad that he have since have time to see the family but the message can not be send out that the foreign secretary be simply too busy to meet detainee family it make those family feel ignore and feel that the government do not really care the reason that family want to see the foreign secretary be that that be the good way for they to get reassurance that the foreign office be pay attention they should not need to see the foreign secretary if they be be look after properly by specially dedicated team whose only job other than ensure that the family be reassure and keep in the loop on what be go on be to get their love one out know the foreign office remain committed to the release of all arbitrarily detain individual but even the perception that they be not do all they can to get someone release be not only incredibly distress to family who have already suffer such unimaginable pain but damage the credibility of the diplomatic service the foreign office and the government as whole none of we should want that quite simply we should not look like we be incompetent incapable or uncaring be also tell that the moment secretary of state declare case to be one of arbitrary detention the speha team kick the whole government system in motion to work on the case they work across government departments as well as with congress external organisation private industry and the medium immediately gather strong team effort to begin put sustained pressure on to the country hold their citizen key point that strike from my conversation with they be that without an office solely focus on these case the team simply do not come together in my discussion with british detainee and campaign group have hear one major concern for year which be the uk government lack of cohesion on these case let give recent example why do the department for business and trade organise an industry delegation to cairo in june and uk export finance help host an egypt uk investment opportunity forum in london in september all while the egyptian government have one of our citizen alaa abd el fattah wrongfully hold in prison without consular access who think that through do anybody think that through or be it one of those thing that because there be not focus just happen suspect that it be the latter and that be why we have to change be fully committed to this government rigorous focus on grow the economy and support the building of prosperous uk egypt trade partnership it be so important that we get investment into this country but wonder what mixed signal we be send what leverage do we have when one department be criticise government for detain our citizen while another department be also try to encourage british business to invest and form partnership in that country what message be that send to detainee family when raise this question with the americans and ask they do you not step on the toe of ambassador how do you not send out mixed message they be keen to stress that it actually make life easy for the ambassador because they be there as the hard cop they be there as almost self contain unit their job be to get people out and that be what they do they pull the lever together in order to ensure that they do they describe ambassador as their secret weapon expert on the country who know the key player and most important know what idea would work they say that they be there to remove the boulder when ambassador have to deal with case of this kind because it take up so much bandwidth that the poor ambassador can not deal with other issue obviously they will still give advice but there be that special team to deal with arbitrarily detain people so that the ambassador can get on with our financial relationship with europe believe that if we have similar unit in the foreign office the foreign office would be more effective and it would be of great assistance to the foreign secretary who can not give his full attention to these uniquely complex case it would also give the family senior point of contact on which they could rely the american unit have the power to impose specific sanction through the levinson act that target those who be responsible for or complicit in the unlawful or wrongful detention of us national we should be make well use of our sanction policy to deter the wrongful detention of british people or as tool to apply pressure to those who hold british national have even hear story of jailer be sanction this can be do by those who be sufficiently ambitious can think laterally and have the necessary focus if we have well parliamentary scrutiny of our sanction policy perhaps we would make well use of it but that be debate for another day perhaps we simply do not know how the government decide what case warrant sanction however the whole government approach use the embassy in the country the regional expert in the state department and the negotiation expert in speha strike as absolutely the right approach think it be lesson that we should learn from the americans and hope that the foreign office take this recommendation seriously because it be about time we change thing we can not go on like this do not want to see anyone else outside the foreign office starve themselves in the hope that somehow or other that will help their son or daughter to come back to this country so say please focus on this and please sort it out congratulate my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on secure the debate and on the tremendous amount of work that he have do in this area it be also pleasure to follow the right hon member for south islington and finsbury emily thornberry the chair of the foreign affairs committee which have be delighted to join as new member in the last few week be pleased to be able to say that think she make an excellent contribution and agree with every word of it also join she in recognise the amount of work that be do by the previous committee in the last parliament under the chairmanship of my hon friend the member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns who continue to chair the all party parliamentary group on arbitrary detention and hostage affair and to take strong interest in the subject the appg produce an extremely good report although have to say that the government response be bit disappointing so it be right for we to press these matter far today myself chair the all party parliamentary group on media freedom medium freedom be also under huge pressure across the globe far too many journalist have die in pursuit of their profession or be currently in prison accord to the late report journalist and medium worker be detain as of today the uk have rightly champion the cause of medium freedom especially in the foreign office and we need to go on make that case it be doubly concern that some of the journalist who be in prison be british my right hon friend have mention few specific case and want to do the same both he and be privileged to attend the magnitsky award dinner couple of week ago bill browder now sir william browder have do huge amount initially to support prisoner in russia and to bring sanction against those responsible for the death of sergei magnitsky but he have widen his campaign to highlight case of detain political prisoner around the world in respect of the first case shall mention be able to congratulate the government on the part that they play at the dinner it be privilege to meet vladimir kara murza have raise his case in the house and many other people have do so over the last few year we be seriously worried particularly after the death of alexei navalny that kara murza would be next there be certainly evidence to suggest that he would have die have he remain in prison and know that the british government along with the american government and other do great deal to obtain his release through prisoner swap that take place few month ago have some concern about the concept of prisoner swap because there be always the risk that carry out swap to obtain the release of innocent people in return for send back people who be certainly not innocent which be what happen in this instance simply encourage the detention of other innocent in the future in kara murza case however think that have he not be release he would have die the release at the same time of evan gershkovich an american journalist be clearly another strong priority it be welcome that here be case in which we have actually obtain the release of british national but sadly number of other be still in prison my right hon friend mention several of they but will start as he do with the case of jimmy lai remarkably brave man who be now detain under the draconian national security law that have be introduce in hong kong it be noticeable that just two decade ago hong kong be in the world ranking for press freedom it be now jimmy lai be publisher who work to uphold freedom of speech he be imprison as result and his health be now under severe pressure after four year in solitary confinement have meet his son sebastien as have the foreign secretary and we will continue to raise his case here until he be release there have also be reference to alaa abd el fattah like number of other member be able to speak to his mother laila soueif very recently she be on hunger strike to obtain his release he have be convict of spread false news and have be long stand target of the regime it be notable that in opposition the foreign secretary be very vocal in condemn the egyptian government in respect of his case and actually call on the government to deny the egyptian ambassador access to whitehall until he be release have not observe the egyptian ambassador be deny access and alaa abd el fattah be still in prison therefore ask the foreign secretary to reflect on what he say in opposition and to strengthen the progress that we be make the third case that want to mention be that of british journalist who be not in prison clare rewcastle brown an independent journalist have be the target of abusive lawsuit in malaysia since she expose corruption there this year she be sentence in absentia to two year in prison on bogus defamation charge have not even be tell that she have be put on trial obviously she be anxious to appeal but she have be tell that if she be to appeal she must attend the court in malaysia in person very understandably she be extremely reluctant to do so give the amount of personal risk the government as far as be aware have not comment on her case and she have struggle to obtain support from the foreign office so ask the minister specifically to look into her case as well there be also the case of gubad ibadoghlu an azeri activist but one who be senior adviser at the london school of economics he return to visit his family in azerbaijan in and be promptly arrest and lock up his family be quite badly assault during his arrest and my right hon friend and and any other who be at that dinner couple of week ago will have hear his daughter speak about that and about her fear for his health he too be seriously ill and need assistance on that point it be worth mention that dr ibadoghlu son visit parliament few week ago when we have an opportunity to discuss his case he have close association with part of the university of london and he be give assurance that it would be safe for he to return to visit his ail mother subsequent to his arrest phd student whose name be fazil gasimov be extradite from turkey and torture into give evidence against dr ibadoghlu and he have feel it necessary to go on hunger strike there seem to be huge effort by the azeri government to persecute people even at the same time as cop meeting be schedule to take place in their capital be extremely grateful to my right hon friend who make the point that be just come to as the chair of the foreign affairs committee point out all too often one part of government may be press for somebody release while other part of government seem to have normal relationship with the foreign government responsible and do little we manage to send many delegate to can not remember how many there be but it be certainly in three figure but would be interested to know how many of they actually raise with the government in baku the case of dr ibadoghlu and number of other write to the prime minister before he depart for baku urge he to raise that case understand from the foreign office that he do not raise it with his host be very disappointed to hear that but sadly not surprised think add my name to the letter that my right hon friend send in fairness to the government have reason to believe that one of the foreign office ministers be very concerned about the case think there be high probability that it may have be raise quietly if not publicly let we not argue about whether or not it be raise let we agree that what we should do be continue to raise it with the government of azerbaijan until dr ibadoghlu be release the final case that must mention give that it be raise quite rightly by the hon member for wirral west matthew patrick be that of emily damari one of the hostage be hold in gaza who be british citizen she be and have be hold for day her mother be obviously deeply anxious to know that she be still alive so the government must do everything possible to try to obtain her release know that other member intend to raise other case it be sad that so many british citizen be detain arbitrarily on trump up charge around the world and that this debate be so vital and necessary will finish by endorse some of the recommendation make by the foreign affairs committee in the last parliament which have be echo by its current chair legal right to consular access be very important and be something that the labour party say it would bring in we raise that legal right with the foreign secretary the other day and would be grateful if the minister could confirm that the government still intend to introduce it agree with hon member include the chair of the foreign affairs committee that the establishment of separate directorate for arbitrary and complex detention within the fcdo would be really valuable addition there be confusion at the moment because all too often we be tell that case be be pursue but nothing happen unfortunately with the single exception of vladimir kara murza all too many of those case involve british national who continue to be unfairly and unjustly imprison sometimes at risk to their life look forward to the minister response on those point congratulate the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on secure this debate and on continue to be discomfort in the derrière for successive government on these issue the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis talk about the bright and the good go into the foreign office so will begin by recognise the unfairness of this debate we will all stand up and talk about the bad failing of the foreign office and recognise that the debate will be respond to by minister who represent some of the good effort of civil servant who go into incredibly dangerous and difficult circumstance to try to serve our constituent want to put that on the record there be lot of talk in this chamber about the legacy that this government have inherit and it be good that we be talk about one of the bad one our country record of secure the release of those who have be arbitrarily detain overseas will come to some of the policy issue that other member have touch on but will deal first with the principle behind such case ella wheeler wilcox write to sin by silence when we should protest make coward out of man what be true of individual be also true of nation the chair of the foreign affairs committee my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry speak about the example of the us which be relevant here when other country citizen be hold unjustly it be treat as an affront an injury to all and national slap in the face yes quiet negotiation take place politely behind the scene on behalf of those country prisoner but alongside that polite and patient diplomacy be their citizen full throate outrage know that the staff work on this issue in the foreign office care deeply about it but the right hon member for chingford and woodford green and for maldon sir john whittingdale both raise the case of jimmy lai we have to ask why canada be successful in secure the release of the two michaels and how australia secure the release of journalist cheng lai just last week the americans secure the release of three more of their citizen yet jimmy lai who be british citizen and one of we and who have be arbitrarily detain in solitary confinement for nearly four year have not be free we could talk about jagtar singh johal alaa abd el fattah and so many other our first responsibility as parliament government and country be to be publicly vocally and unanimously furious about this issue everything else follow from the righteous anger that we should all feel on behalf of our citizen who be rot in foreign jail that anger should drive we to ask what be behind the failure of british diplomacy in the past lack of strategy be certainly part of the answer like the chair of the foreign affairs committee be encourage by the noise that the foreign secretary make last week about make good on his promise both on the issue of special envoy and on the right to consular access welcome the government commitment to step up the engagement on these case but that need to be part of an entirely new approach be not naive know that it be only because we be have conversation with foreign government about trade that we be able to get in the room and discuss our citizen who have be unjustly detain indeed when be an adviser in the foreign office the role of minister for trade and human right be stand alone cabinet position because believe we must make deal around the world our constituent standard of living depend on it question whether our current policymake framework on arbitrary detention can ever deliver the kind of response that we would all expect if we find ourselves in prison cell in one of the dark corner of the world for this be about the balance we strike between charming and chastise those we be negotiate with wonder whether our current approach to those who be arbitrarily detain make it inevitable that attempt to secure the release of our people become either prologue or an epilogue to the main story which be one of secure our economic self interest be we send our representative into these negotiation with red line that those on the other side of the table know be write in pencil rather than in pen after year in dubai jail ryan cornelius have have more time than anyone to contemplate that tension he share with letter he have write to the prime minister ahead of the prime minister trip to the gulf on behalf of the uk in which he identify the inherent challenge in diplomacy describe make it clear to your interlocutor that there can be no normal relationship with friendly country which treat our citizen in this way may be an uncomfortable thing for you to do on this visit if you look the other way in the interest of seal few deal you will have diminish this country stand in the eye of the rest of the world for mr cornelius letter get to the heart of the matter in ask our delegation and diplomat to balance arbitrary detention against trade outcome the risk be that they will leave those room have fail to achieve either objective if the arbitrary imprisonment and mistreatment of our citizen be not red line what be if it be red line it can not be something that the people we send into these room might have to give up in order to secure other government priority the release of our people must be understand by those on the other side of the table as non negotiable that be why it be essential that any special envoy we appoint have the power the status and the degree of independence from ministers to make it an immutable principle not just that the policy on the release of hostage will not be sacrifice for other priority but that it can not be sacrifice for other priority my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury the chair of the select committee be far too delicate perhaps not want to appear engage in power grab when she say that this be debate for another time but we have to debate the fact that other jurisdiction place the power for designate state hostage or for apply sanction in response to such case in the hand of the legislature the value of such an approach be that it allow the executive and their diplomat to honestly say in those negotiate room that they can not separate their wide relationship with country from the mistreatment of citizen by its government know that the suggestion of lose such power would be greet with horror in the corridor of king charles street but we can not simply continue with the current model which have leave british citizen in jail as well as great independence in policymake there should also be degree of automaticity in our policy response as have be suggest by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green when an individual be designate as be arbitrarily detain there have to be consistent application of magnitsky sanction this would not only provide an incentive to release the british citizen already hold as it would hold perpetrator to account but it would also act as disincentive to those who might target our people in the future inconsistent action in these case simply embolden those regime and make our citizen less safe finally we have to act in concert with like minded country that be similarly committed to the rule of law recent year have see the erosion of norm around arbitrary detention by autocracy that be increasingly work in concert with each other only co ordinate action by democracy and by those commit to the rule of law can help recreate global order in which such action be deem universally unacceptable there be no cause more urgent than ensure the liberty and freedom of our own citizen commend the right hon gentleman for secure this debate too wish to thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure this debate it be hearten to see that finally the plight of arbitrarily detain uk national have be give long overdue attention for transparency put on record that be vice chair of the all party parliamentary group on arbitrary detention and hostage affair which be brilliantly chair by the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns who know well from my day on the foreign affairs committee she be ably support by baroness kennedy and the hon member for macclesfield tim roca the appg give the family of those hold abroad voice and an opportunity to tell their story directly to member of both houses although people story differ markedly in the circumstance of their detention there be striking similarity in how they feel about how they have be treat and about be let down by successive united kingdom governments follow the appg inaugural meeting we launch an inquiry on why that perception exist among those who be or have be arbitrarily detain and their family give they voice that they have hitherto simply not have put on record my sincere thank to emily foale of the international bar association human rights institute which provide the appg secretariat and have be the drive force behind our inquiry urge all member and ministers to read the report when it be publish at our first evidence session we hear from jimmy lai son sebastien and his lawyer caoilfhionn gallagher kc as well as from ambassador james cunningham the former us consul general to hong kong know that they will be listen to today debate and will be extremely grateful to every single member who raise jimmy case this afternoon our second evidence session hold last week be devoted to the case of alaa abd el fattah the british egyptian dual national who have spend most of the last decade in an egyptian prison for his writing on democracy and human right alaa become british national in through his mother who be bear in london however the egyptian authority have refuse to recognise his uk nationality and have therefore deny he the uk consular access to which he be absolutely entitle alaa be due to finish his late five year sentence on september but in an unprecedented twist and clear violation of both international and egyptian domestic law the authority in cairo refuse to release he declare that the two and bit year that he spend in pre trial detention would not count towards his sentence and that he will be keep in prison until in protest as we have hear his year old mother laila soueif begin hunger strike today mark the day of her hunger strike be delighted that laila daughter and alaa cousin omar be in the gallery such be their determination that laila and omar attend our second inquiry session last week to give their account of what be happen to alaa they feel that he have be let down by successive british government the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell have secure an adjournment debate on this topic today and be sure that he will build formidable case for the uk government do much more to secure alaa release rather than make an identical contribution to the hon gentleman will use my time to share some of what alaa mother and cousin say to our inquiry last week as have say one of the big blow to the family be egypt decision not to release alaa when his sentence be spend when ask the family how they think the uk government have react alaa mother say get the impression that they have register the fact that alaa have actually finish his sentence even though make sure to notify the british government two month before it be as if they have actually register the significance of this date alaa cousin omar add on july the send an email congratulate the foreign secretary on his appointment and then say the fear now be that the egyptian government be go to release he he continue then on the of september the foreign secretary meet with the egyptian foreign secretary for the first time publicly and there be picture of they smile together four day before the release date on of september it really be not good look for the foreign secretary to have pose for photograph with his egyptian counterpart four day before uk national human right activist be due to be release from prison and after be warn that move be afoot to detain he illegally alaa mother say we warn they she say we do warn they that it might happen when we warn they that this date be come up when ask about alaa reaction to all this she say he be disappoint very much by the behaviour of the british government you sort of expect the egyptian government to do atrocious thing the fact that the british government swallow they be not good much of the family criticism of successive uk government relate to the way that the same approach be take time and again regardless of who be in office as laila say four successive uk prime ministers include keir starmer have call for alaa release but none have take any action beyond raise the case she be absolutely right that be very valid point the impression rightly or wrongly be that awkward human right conversation be have and there be much shuffling of foot and few embarrassed platitude be exchange before the discussion on trade take place one have to wonder how far that observation be from reality what the family want not just alaa family but all the family we have speak to be whole government approach not just to secure alaa release but to ensure that if something like this happen again any regime arbitrarily detain uk national will understand that there will be serious consequence they want the uk to send clear signal that normal bilateral relationship will not apply we have to make those relationship lot more difficult and be clear that there be certain thing that the uk government can do but will not do and can give but will not give because of the regime behaviour in the case of egypt that whole government approach would include change the travel advice and warn uk national travel to egypt that consular assistance can not be guarantee if citizen be arrest as former british diplomat james lynch tell our inquiry last week the us embassy have on its advice warning that it may have limit ability to provide consular service in case of arrest or detention more than member of both houses write to the government to suggest that they do the same because tourism from the united kingdom make up of egyptian gdp the egyptians look closely at fcdo travel advice and they would certainly take notice of uk travel advice if it change to be in line with what the americans have do as we have hear many time this afternoon and as we have hear from the family the uk have leverage but unlike other country it be reluctant or unwilling to use it to secure the release of arbitrarily detain national if the uk be to be take seriously in this arena it will have to use leverage and adopt whole government approach which include trade people in cairo believe that there be an egypt uk trade summit in the pipeline the uk trade envoy recently visit egypt and there be significant trade delegation from egypt to the uk in september which include the ministers for finance and trade as well as the deputy governor of the central bank be alaa case raise strongly suspect not but it could and should have be be the egyptian ambassador summon by the fcdo when alaa release date be change he should have be but strongly suspect that he be not in short alaa and his family feel badly let down by this and previous uk government in opposition the now government say all the right thing but when in power they have prove to be just as ineffective as the last government have no doubt that the minister and the foreign secretary be sincere in what they have say so that tell that there be something fundamentally wrong with the system that system might work for government but it do not work for people in their hour of great need that have to change give the last word to alaa mother laila who tell our inquiry if the government think it risk problem with egypt by push to let alaa out it be risk the same problem in different way by not push we be go to do our good to embarrass this government and to embarrass british company who be invest in egypt if alaa be not let out be sorry to say this but if thing go as far as collapse and die it be embarrass universally the good case scenario for they be to get this resolve any way they can sincerely hope that the minister take note thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for bring the debate to the house want to talk about jagtar singh johal sikh activist and blogger from dumbarton in scotland he be not constituent of mine but very soon after be elect as the mp for wolverhampton west receive many email from my constituent raise concern about his detention in india which have be ongoing for seven year my constituency may have one of large sikh population in the united kingdom but lot of the email that receive be from non sikhs that show that people whoever they be wherever they be be concerned about human right breach jagtar be british citizen who travel to india in october to get marry and it be say that three week later he be abduct by plain clothe police officer who torture he with electricity to get false confession link he to an alleged conspiracy to murder over time further charge be add some as lately as jagtar continue to be hold in delhi jail in november united nations work party state that jagtar have be arrest because of his sikh activism and in may un working group on arbitrary detention find that jagtar detention be arbitrary under international law and lack any legal basis and that his fair trial right have be gravely violate un expert call for jagtar johal to be release immediately the campaign seek jagtar release have receive cross party support from mps in this house in july parliamentarian write to the then prime minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak ask he to call for jagtar release when he travel to india for the summit leader of both the labour and conservative party have previously suggest that there be no legal basis for jagtar detention which be arbitrary and moreover that this government must act decisively to negotiate his release particularly commend the prime minister for raise mr johal case with prime minister modi in india on november and our foreign secretary for meet mr johal brother his mp and the ngo reprieve to discuss mr johal case on october we need to do more what have happen to jagtar johal be against all the rule of natural justice we have british citizen who by all consensus have be detain in foreign jail arbitrarily for seven year we be therefore right to be concern and right to want to know what be be do to secure his release we have right to know on regular basis what be happen with jagtar johal congratulate the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for bring the matter forward and as he do so often in the house for set the scene clearly clinically and evidentially today debate be happen thank to his request to the backbench business committee and we be pleased about that it be pleasure to follow the hon member for wolverhampton west warinder juss will speak about jagtar singh johal as well and it would be remiss of we in this house not to recall the effort of martin docherty hughes who be the mp for mr johal constituency and who valiantly fight the case throughout the time he be here there be not time in the week or month that he do not bring it up he certainly do his bit with dedication and commitment it be frustrating that after this period of time we still see little headway rise today to highlight an urgent and deeply troubling matter that strike at the heart of what we stand for as nation the unjust detention of british citizen abroad for their belief those individual embody the value of freedom justice and dignity and their plight call for nothing less than our unwavere solidarity and absolute action just last week during oral question ask the foreign secretary whether section should be set aside within the fcdo task specifically with look at this matter it be after question pose by right hon member for chingford and woodford green and he give an indication that he be consider that can the minister give we more information on where we be with that the clear and strong indication from the foreign secretary on that day be that that would happen if it happen it would follow on from what the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry refer to as well what she request would be incredibly helpful if there be section it could take up the case of british citizen quite honestly british passport have to mean something more than bit of paper that carry in my inside pocket everywhere go it mean something for our right our citizenship and our protection under the citizenship of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland will begin with the harrowing case of jagtar singh johal the young british citizen from dumbarton in he travel to india to celebrate his wedding with all the joy that occasion would give only to find himself abruptly detain talk to martin docherty hughes about it who be fount of knowledge on the case and always give we the detail on his contact with the family since then mr johal have endure more than seven year of imprisonment under charge that credible source indicate be baseless allegation of torture during his detention far compound the gravity of the case it be clear that mr johal activism for sikh human right have make he target declare an interest as the chair of the appg for international freedom of religion or belief which stand up for those with christian faith those of other faith and those with no faith we be fortunate within the appg to have number of sikhs and we stand side by side with they on their right to human right and on issue of persecution the treatment of mr johal be not just tragedy for he and his family more than that it be an affront to the very principle of justice and human right that we cherish in this house and of which every one of we will speak highly and sincerely today his situation also underscore systematic failure in the protection of british national abroad the prolonged inaction have leave his family and the whole sikh community across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to grapple with unimaginable anguish that can not stand know the minister have be in place for only the last five or six month but in that time he have make reputation of be one who have deep interest in these matter and who look to find way forward no pressure on you minister but in all honesty we be look for something fairly edible at the end of this so that we actually have an idea of just where we be go urge the foreign secretary and the minister to use every diplomatic tool available from public advocacy to behind the scene negotiation to ensure mr johal release and to secure accountability for those responsible for his abuse turn my attention to jimmy lai about whom have speak on number of occasion as have many other he be british citizen and it be clearly underline that his passport be british passport he be devout roman catholic who represent the courage of stand for democracy in the face of tyranny founder of the pro democracy newspaper apple daily mr lai have long be vocal advocate for press freedom and human right in hong kong we salute he and we acknowledge his courage have never meet mr lai but there be many people in the world have not meet and it do not stop speak up for they it do not stop we revere their name in this house and state their right to have the freedom and liberty that we enjoy mr lai now find himself in prison under the draconian national security law impose by beijing face charge of collude with foreign country my goodness and conspiracy to defraud those be vague accusation with no evidential basis whatsoever wield to silence dissent and suppress freedom jimmy lai imprisonment be emblematic of the broad erosion of civil liberty in hong kong region where promise of autonomy and democratic right under the sino british joint declaration be be systematically dismantle how tragic it be to watch what be go on his willingness to stay in hong kong despite escalating provocation and persecution speak volume about his commitment to the principle he hold dear ask all member of this house would you have have the strength of character to have do the same know what be come down the road towards you his willingness to stay in hong kong can not be underline enough the house must unequivocally condemn the action of the chinese authority and demand mr jimmy lai immediate release freedom of religion and belief be important the case of jimmy lai be illustrative because they do not have to but the chinese authority have lock he away from any involvement with his faith he can not receive communion and he can not give confession for those who do not believe in it note that that really be powerful for catholic he have have to endure that which although petty and pointless be way of try to break he would the hon gentleman like to comment on that bring the case up in westminster hall jimmy lai be deny the eucharist when it be his right to practise his religious belief when there be that attack on someone religious belief along with persecution human right abuse and the denial of that very right we thank god that jimmy lai have that relationship with god in heaven he may not have the eucharist but he have great faith which hopefully will strengthen he however when someone want to outwardly express themselves and be deny that that be what the right hon gentleman be refer to that be totally wrong the chinese government particularly those in hong kong should be criticise for the way that they have deny jimmy lai his right furthermore we must act to ensure that the international community do not normalise the repression of freedom in hong kong the case of mr johal and mr lai be not isolate they reflect troubling global trend where authoritarian regime act with impunity to silence voice of dissent whether they be target activist journalist or those practise their faith these regime seek to erode the very freedom that form the bedrock of just society be remind of amanda damari who think be british passport holder her daughter emily be kidnap by hamas terrorist meet amanda just after easter when be on visit to israel be incredibly impressed by her courage and determination to see her daughter once again believe that we in this house have duty to fight amanda damari case for the release of her daughter the united kingdom have moral and diplomatic duty to lead by example word of condemnation as important as they be be not enough call on the government to do three thing prioritise these case in all diplomatic bilateral and multilateral engagement explore the application of target sanction against individual and entity involve in these human right violation and advocate for strong mechanism of accountability at forum such as the united nations and the commonwealth we can not always fight battle on our own but we can fight they well together urge that we do so in positive way we must also be mindful of the human story behind these injustice we try to express the human story behind each one of these case in the way that we can but perhaps we do so without use the individual knowledge that we have jagtar singh johal be husband son and brother jimmy lai be father and tireless advocate for freedom amanda damari just want her daughter home both those man be people of faith and so too be amanda their family bear the heavy burden of wait hop and fight for their return we owe it to they and to ourselves as nation this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to ensure that their sacrifice be not in vain do not want to interrupt the hon member for strangford but he know well than to refer to the minister as you because it end up mean in the chair too congratulate the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on secure this vital debate he be an impressive champion on this issue as know from my time spend serve as an officer with he on the all party parliamentary group on magnitsky sanction and reparation it should be primary function of any give state to protect its citizen it should not matter where in the world british national or an individual with strong tie to the uk get into trouble we as nation should be right alongside they try to get they out arbitrary detention abroad and relate human right abuse such as torture be unacceptable they often have profound long last physical psychological and social impact not just on the individual concern but on their love one friend and wide social network many member have speak in depth today about individual case of british national or uk link individual detain abroad so will touch just lightly on two that have follow mostly closely first as the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale have mention there be the unacceptable continued detention of dr gubad ibadoghlu in azerbaijan whose son ibad have the pleasure of meeting just last month ibad and his sibling be hugely impressive advocate for their father and know that he will be proud of the tenacity and dignity with which they have conduct their campaign for his release dr ibadoghlu have spend more than quarter of century advocate for democratic azerbaijan he have tirelessly fight for fundamental human right and campaign against corruption in azerbaijan fossil fuel industry he have be detain since july on clearly spurious charge under threat of spend year in prison while contend with serious health issue the european court of human rights have demand that he be transfer to specialised medical institution so that he can receive the treatment that he so desperately need but all the while the azerbaijan government have deny this request claim spuriously that his health be satisfactory wish to place on record my support for the immediate release of dr ibadoghlu as british resident and visit fellow at the london school of economics the uk should be stand by he and use all available diplomatic lever to show the azeri government that their flagrant human right abuse will not be tolerate secondly wish to join the right hon member for chingford and woodford green and for maldon and the hon member for strangford jim shannon in raise the case of jimmy lai jimmy have be hold in solitary confinement in hong kong for over four year for publish content critical of the chinese regime have significant hong kong community in my constituency of bolton west and know from speak to many of they that they worry that if it be jimmy detain today it could be they tomorrow indeed many of my constituent be effectively force from their home in hong kong due to china disruption of hong kong democratic freedom which we have hear about in this chamber today only last week in debate on the status of taiwan we hear how jimmy treatment be part of broad pattern of behaviour which be china consistent and blatant disregard for the international rule base system in both those case fear that the uk government have not do their utmost to fulfil that very central function of protect our national share the view of colleague that unfortunately the foreign office lack clear centralised and proactive strategy for deal with arbitrary detention of uk national give the severity of the issue believe that dedicated uk envoy in this area in similar vein to the us role of presidential envoy for hostage affair should be consider very swiftly by the foreign office while in opposition the foreign secretary pledge to look at that so hope the minister can give an update on how this pledge will be realise in fairly short order good first step however would be to consider great transparency in the foreign office it could for example share with us information about how many british national be currently be arbitrarily detain hope the minister will speak to that in his wind up at the very least we should be able to hold statistical datum on the number of victim of arbitrary detention as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green quite rightly say welcome this government manifesto pledge to give british citizen the legal right to consular access when they get into legal difficulty overseas find it extremely concern that that be not already the case as colleague have already attest to consular assistance not only come with protection against the very bad excess of arbitrary detention but be sometimes the only link between the individual suffering in absolutely harrowing circumstance and the outside world it be no exaggeration to say that it can be life save and wish to go on the record to commend the work of dedicated official in the foreign office when such assistance have be provide madam deputy speaker wish to say one final word on the diplomatic lever available to we magnitsky sanction be critical tool for ensure that there be cost to hostage taking and arbitrary detention and they should be deploy in consistent manner in case such as those mention in the chamber today in addition we know that asset freeze can be very effective tool as can deny sanction individual access to london financial sector and property market sanction must be use in holistic manner against those responsible for arbitrary detention of british national to deter state from engage in arbitrary detention we must also ensure that they bite as much as possible on related point just last month financial times analysis find that company register in the british overseas territory export million worth of good to russia in in an apparent breach of uk sanction the lack of open ownership record in our british overseas territory complicate effort to establish who be involve in such shipment the same principle apply to asset that we would seek to freeze that matter for today debate because without fully public register of ownership we will never be totally comfortable that we be not unwittingly allow individual who be subject to sanction to evade they place on the record my thank to the organisation campaign on this issue include redress and my deep sympathy with the family of those who have be arbitrarily detain abroad their suffering and of course the suffering of those detain be why this debate need to be have and why the government must act on the concern raise by colleague on both side of the house to make the final back bench contribution which have no doubt will be just as impactful as the other call douglas mcallister thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to speak in this backbench business debate on detain british national abroad commend the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure it and for his relentless campaigning on the important cause of arbitrarily detain british national at risk of human right abuse abroad thank the backbench business committee for support his application this house should be concern by the number of british national detain abroad and at risk wish to raise in particular the plight of my constituent from west dunbartonshire jagtar singh johal who have be detain in india for over seven year thank my hon friend the member for wolverhampton west warinder juss and the hon member for strangford jim shannon for their contribution to the debate on his behalf jagtar be british citizen from dunbarton campaigner himself on human right abuse in india he be abduct and detain in november after his arrest he be brutally torture and now face some seven year later nine case against he base on evidence obtain by false confession countless application for his bail have be refuse after all these year jagtar remain not just in prison but in solitary confinement his suffering be unimaginable and his daily existence almost intolerable be sure that this house will be concern about jagtar mental and physical wellbeing after be confine in such condition which be why the support that the british government provide to their national in harrowing condition such as those that my constituent endure be vital consular access and assistance be very often the only link between the individual and the outside world that have prove to be the case for my constituent jagtar singh johal consular access should have legal framework and not just be discretionary offering change the culture of the fcdo and provide family with certainty about what support their love one will receive as matter of right be necessity we must introduce it as far as my constituent jagtar singh johal be concern and as my hon friend the member for wolverhampton west state the un working group on arbitrary detention conclude over two and half year ago in may that under international law jagtar detention be arbitrary yet here we be day later he remain in prison unconvicted and in solitary confinement to add to that misery jagtar and his family must cope with the very real fear that he be at serious risk of death sentence at least two of the charge against jagtar carry the death penalty former government response have be inadequate and successive uk foreign secretaries have fail to seek jagtar release and repatriation to the uk that be simply unacceptable and not good enough the new government and foreign secretary now have the opportunity to uphold the principled position that we take in opposition be encourage by the progress and support that have receive from the foreign office and the foreign secretary and his ministers who have provide with regular update and report have also receive assurance in this house include from the prime minister that jagtar case be raise directly with the indian government and prime minister modi be encourage that the government be seek jagtar immediate release last month around the time of seven year anniversary of jagtar detention the foreign secretary meet with and my constituent gurpreet singh johal the brother of jagtar at the foreign office the foreign

alaa family feel about his continued detention know that minister have voice the need for action in alaa case as the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale mention in opposition the foreign secretary say in that there should be serious diplomatic consequence for egypt if alaa be not release he also say that the uk billion trade partnership with egypt afford the uk tremendous leverage

hope in david lammy but just can believe nothing be happen if he be serious and have take the step he promise while in opposition would have be free today but instead they just ignore my release date because there be zero pressure now think either will die in here or if my mother die will hold he to account three week ago meet sebastien lai and the legal team support his father jimmy lai as hon and right hon member have set out jimmy be clearly victim of politically motivated imprisonment his staunch support of democracy and freedom of speech in hong kong be remarkable yet the chinese authority have detain he for four year without trial hold he in solitary confinement under the national security law they have deny he access to consular support place he at health risk as year old with chronic condition and deny he his right to practise religion last month they restart his trial after an month hiatus sebastien be deeply worried that his father will die in prison the house also hear today from the hon member for wolverhampton west warinder juss for strangford jim shannon and for west dunbartonshire douglas mcallister about the detention of jagtar singh johal in as they say the finding of the un working group on arbitrary detention in may uphold the view of his family that he have be detain without any legal basis and that his right have be gravely violate yesterday meet representative of amnesty international who want to be sure that the house would hear of the detention without trial of british citizen mehran raoof in iran in october mehran be one of many british national detain in iran in other case the family of those detain have ask that their relative be not name that be not surprise give the reputation of the iranian state for appal human right abuse in iran and for extraterritorial threat to iranians live overseas include here in the uk tonight nazanin zaghari ratcliffe will give the orwell lecture the example of her imprisonment and detention of the courage of her family and of the action and inaction of successive ministers should be sobering reminder of what iran be prepared to do to british national whom it consider pawn in hostage diplomacy be newcomer to the house but know many member who speak today have be long stand advocate in this place of the right of those prisoner and pay tribute to they for their steadfast campaigning sadly despite the continuous effort of those parliamentarian neither the previous conservative government nor this new labour government have succeed in advance the case of those have mention alaa have now spend over five year in continuous detention jimmy have now spend nearly four year in solitary confinement jagtar be arrest over seven year ago mehran be imprison over four year ago the family and friend of detainee be call on the government to do more and they be right to ask why more be not be do the prime minister or the foreign secretary may be raise the case of those detainee but the truth be that the country hold they do not appear to be listen do appreciate the government dilemma after the previous conservative government do so much to erode the uk stand in the world this government have weak starting point therefore understand the temptation to soft pedal on awkward issue but as member have say that be the wrong strategy agree with the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry that we need more self confident and consistent strategy to guide the government approach when british national be arbitrarily detain overseas let set out five further step that the government can and should take first the government should call for the immediate release of any detain british national or dual national who be arbitrarily detain secondly the government should insist on consular access to any british national and that uk official attend trial thirdly the government should commit to raise the case in every ministerial interaction with that government as part of join up approach that do not treat human right as one silo in the bilateral relationship fourthly the government should name the consequence of ignore their request for action and follow suitable period to allow the detaining government to act should enforce those consequence against government and individual as member have raise fifthly the government should implement the recommendation of the foreign affairs committee and appoint an envoy or director for arbitrary detention who would have the role of pursue those case and provide regular update to the family of detainee on the step the government be take to secure their release as the hon member for east renfrewshire say it be not enough for ambassador and ministers to increase the adjective of disappointment as each month pass and as each polite request be ignore will the minister commit today to take those step in every case of arbitrary detention diplomacy rest upon both party have clear understanding of the interest and need of the other as the prime minister say after meet president xi recently and briefly raise jimmy lai case the uk should challenge china while be pragmatic and predictable partner to take two specific example will the government indicate to the chinese government that the chancellor propose trade and investment visit to beijing will not go ahead until jimmy lai be release will the government tell the egyptian government that unless consular access be grant to alaa abd el fattah the fcdo travel advice will be alter to warn uk traveller to egypt that it do not always recognise british national and therefore consular support can not be guarantee to travel under the protection of uk passport must have meaning it can not be polite request instead the government must put in place strategy that restore what every passport state that country be require to assure uk citizen of free passage and necessary protection call the shadow minister be grateful to my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure this important and impactful debate he speak with such knowledge on the matter thank all other hon and right hon member for their contribution support british national abroad should rightly be priority for the fcdo look after the welfare of detainee in particular be cornerstone of the excellent work do by our consular team here and overseas it be crucial that minister back our foreign office staff detainee and family by provide leadership at the high level and support they wherever possible witness some of that during my time as foreign office minister and like many member experience it at constituency level see how the fcdo have help with the return of number of consular case in our last full year in government in the consular team at the foreign office support british national around the world include victim of crime and those who have be detain or hospitalise we be clear that our citizen abroad must get access to the help they need when they need it note that the foreign secretary confirm last week that he hop to announce an envoy who will deal with more complex detention case gently say to the government and the minister that this must not become an excuse for outsource something that be the responsibility of ministers detain british national will rightly expect ministers to grip those issue and provide the political leadership that they and their family deserve the government also promise to introduce new right to consular assistance in case of human right violation which disappointingly be not forthcoming in the king speech would be grateful if the minister could update the house on the government plan to bring forward that commitment there be number of high profile consular case some of which we have hear about today that parliamentarian rightly continue to take keen interest in see resolve they include among other the case of jagtar singh johal alaa abd el fattah ryan cornelius and jimmy lai we raise our concern about jagtar singh johal case include his allegation of torture with the government of india on over occasion as foreign secretary lord cameron of chipping norton personally meet mr johal brother in glasgow we constantly raise alaa abd el fattah case with the high level of the egyptian government and press hard for urgent consular access we remain deeply concerned about his case and be absolutely clear that he need to be release when in government we also regularly raise consular matter with the united arab emirates authority include ryan cornelius case at an official and ministerial level and consular staff be in regular contact with mr cornelius and his family to provide he with ongoing support we call strongly for the release of jimmy lai for an end to his politically motivated trial and for consular access we raise that consistently at the very high level and press for the repeal of hong kong national security legislation the shadow foreign secretary my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel recently meet mr lai son sebastien we will continue to call for mr lai release in the light of the deep concern share across the house some of which we have hear today would be grateful if the minister provide an update on the government work with international counterpart to progress those case and on his recent engagement with those individual family in respect of jimmy lai case in particular return to theme that have raise from the dispatch box before the government pursuit of close relation with beijing there be no shying away from the fact that the charge lay against mr lai arise because of the national security law that china introduce in hong kong when he be foreign secretary lord cameron of chipping norton be unequivocal that that law be clear breach of the sino british joint declaration and we continue to call for its repeal the foreign secretary have say that there be disagreement between his government and the chinese on that matter so hope that the minister will assure the house that the government will articulate those difference in opinion loud and clear by make an explicit call for that law to be repeal the foreign secretary want to avoid surprise with beijing but we can not afford for any reset of relation to be all give and no take just for the sake of avoid difficult conversation more broadly we must be clear eyed that the autocratic world use dual national as pawn to achieve its objective and obtain leverage indeed we have see disturbing pattern of british national be imprison by autocracy in recent year we see that in russia with the appalling treatment of vladimir kara murza and in iran with the callous and cowardly execution of alireza akbari do the minister have strategy for counter that pattern of cynical exploitation of british national put on record our thank to the consular team in the uk and in british embassy high commission and consulate around the world for the work that they undertake around the clock often in extremely difficult circumstance to support thousand of british national every year many case may not be as high profile as those that and other right hon and hon member have set out but they be all equally important when it come to safeguard our interest and look after our citizen would be grateful if the minister outline how he be back our consular team to ensure that they be properly resource and can keep up their excellent work we have duty to british national at home and abroad especially those who be deny access to vital support it be right that we give consular service our full backing in deliver that support to support that work and to ensure that the uk uphold its duty to its citizen the government must provide political leadership by continue to raise case at the high level call the minister start by pay tribute to the family who be in the gallery and to those who be not as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith say have some personal experience in these matter and know just how painful it be to have love one detain overseas often for long period and with great uncertainty about next step have meet many of those who be in the public gallery they be tribute to their family and be endlessly in awe of the bravery commitment and determination that they show as the right hon gentleman mention many of these case have be go on for some time will start by provide context on the general situation several member have make comment about trend line will offer datum on the foreign office response as have be request will set out labour position and then will turn briefly to some of the case that have be raise however as be say by the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for bicester and woodstock calum miller many family do not wish to have their case name in this house and many of they be not represent in the public gallery that do not make they any less of priority for the rest of the ministerial team or the foreign office join the shadow minister the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton and many other right hon and hon member in pay tribute to consular team for their work the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis say that many foreign office staff be the good and bright and that be certainly true for consular team who be very happy to represent as the consular minister and to visit everywhere go the week before last be in pakistan where our staff deal with some of the most complex consular case as the house will know they work to ensure that people have what be often their only contact with the outside world once they have be detain as many member have say would not claim to be one of the good or bright but be what the right hon member for new forest east would probably call specialist unit give that during my time in the foreign office deal with many such case indeed work with other nation as many member have encourage the government to do it be of course desirable to look at other country system my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry mention the speha system with which work extensively can assure she that talk to my american counterpart include the special envoy who will see this weekend member seek consistency in our response to consular case they will recognise that what govern our ability to provide consular assistance be the vienna convention which mandate that we can not interfere in foreign legal system we can only ensure that proper consular assistance be offer many member have rightly highlight the difficulty in identify whether british national have have proper recourse to due process and their full right the foreign office remain focused on that question we be assist british national detain overseas some of those case be more straightforward some be considerably more complex we provide assistance both directly and through partnership with prisoners abroad highly value charity with which many member will be familiar it work to ensure not only that british national overseas be visit by the foreign office but that they have access to essential such as food and medication prisoner abroad also support the family of those detain abroad vital service that we will continue to support we have long run partnership with non governmental organisation such as reprieve and the death penalty project which provide expertise in complex case know that right hon and hon member be familiar with the foreign office arrangement so will not dwell on they too much but let be clear about what labour government will do differently and why we will introduce special envoy for complex consular case in part because we have hear from family include those in the public gallery about their experience of seek foreign office support we will introduce that envoy so that there be as many member have request part of the foreign office with particular focus on complex consular case we will also introduce new right to consular assistance hope to return to the house shortly to set out more detail on both provision the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale rightly highlight that we should be uneasy about the increase global trend of try to use british and other foreign national as diplomatic leverage it be important to repeat that we will never accept british national be use as pawn or diplomatic leverage we take strong position on that and will continue to do so we will not haggle for british national but will ensure that they have their proper right in accordance with the vienna convention and will do everything we can to support their family turn briefly to some of the case that have be raise reiterate that will not mention every case there be many name that be burn into my mind as member would expect and case that we work on regularly that will not mention now but will address those on which have be particularly press for answer begin with the case of mr cornelius and mr ridley the family be above in the gallery we will continue to provide support to they but reassure the house that have now raise with the ruler of dubai the request for clemency and outline the british government support for mr cornelius pardon application the previous foreign secretary do so as be allude to by the shadow minister think it be important to provide clarification on that recognise that there have be unwelcome news in this case will not go into further detail about that in this place but we will continue to work on the case meet mr cornelius family recently and reassure the house that have commit to continue to meet they for as long as the two case remain ongoing mr lai case which be also raise remain priority for the british government we be closely monitor his trial and can reassure the house that diplomat from our consulate general will continue to attend his court proceeding as this house be aware the prime minister raise the matter of mr lai with president xi at the summit and the foreign secretary have raise it with his equivalent the minister for the indo pacific have also raise this case with both the chinese and hong kong authority we continue to call on the hong kong authority to end their politically motivated prosecution and immediately release mr lai pay tribute to my hon friend the members for wolverhampton west warinder juss and for west dunbartonshire douglas mcallister for raise the case of mr johal we continue to press the government of india for fast progress to resolve this matter recognise the diligent effort of his brother who understand be in the gallery and the deep and profound frustration about this case it must be resolve and that resolution must include an investigation into mr johal allegation of torture will return to this house later today to talk far about mr el fattah case that case remain at the front of my mind and that of the foreign secretary he meet the family who understand be behind in the gallery last week the prime minister have raise the case with president sisi the foreign secretary and have both raise it with the egyptian foreign minister and my right hon friend the minister for development raise it just this week again with the egyptian foreign minister mr el fattah case be tragic be very mindful of the hunger strike of his mother who have meet and whose effort have be mention by many hon member we will continue to focus on mr el fattah and look forward to return to the house this afternoon to discuss his case far on emily damari hostage hold by hamas and british national she and all the other uk national and people with uk link hold by hamas be very much on our mind we continue to press for their immediate release for humanitarian access to they and for the medical assistance that we be sure they will require meet their family this week and they will remain steadfast focus would also like to comment briefly on the case of dr ibadoghlu we have indeed raise this case with the authority include recently at the end of october as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green suggest these be not easy case many of they have be go on for some time and the appointment of an envoy be important but reassure this house that be the minister responsible for consular affair it be not for official to own these case as the shadow minister have make clear that be for ministers that be very much the view that and the foreign secretary take look forward to return to the house to discuss some of these case in more detail and to tell member about the measure that we will take regret that in our few month in government we have not yet see positive progress on all these case and note that many member have refer to the negative trend in some of these area reassure the house that we will continue to focus on this issue above all as be say by the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for bicester and woodstock the first duty of government be to look after their people there be no high responsibility for than serve british national whatever corner of the world they be in before the minister conclude there be something that many member have call for that he have not touch on we pass an act on magnitsky sanction some time ago should those sanction not be part of our attack on hostage taking and on people be detain abroad for no reason why be those involve not be threaten with sanction and not have sanction apply to they why be the government all government so reluctant to use this tool be afraid that as the right hon gentleman might expect will not provide detailed commentary on whether we be consider sanction in any of these case our position have be that we do not like to discuss sanction in the house before we implement they but recognise the thrust of what he say think he be ask to ensure that there be no diplomatic lever that we would not consider pull to ensure the safety of our national and can confirm that thank my hon friend for be so clear but can he say whether the criterion for decide whether british national have be arbitrarily detain will be publish recognise the work of my right hon friend and her committee the detailed report on this subject that the foreign affairs committee publish during the previous parliament as well as the work of the appg on these matter as she say about the american experience it be important for an envoy to be appropriately focused and to have limited number of case we be keen to engage with the house on how to ensure that the envoy be focus on limited number of case and on what criterion be most appropriate my view be that the process will continue to require ministerial discretion as the shadow minister say but look forward to talk to both my right hon friend committee and the house again in more detail once we be in position to bring forward more concrete proposal unless any other member wish to intervene on will conclude these be some of the most difficult issue that the government and members of the house face pay tribute not only to the family in the gallery and beyond but to right hon and hon member during this debate there have be allusion to the historical preference of the british government for not discuss consular case in public in any great detail in some case as the liberal democrat spokesperson say that be for reason of safety or judgment the foreign office have assess what be most likely to assist the british national in question however recognise that as hon member have say this issue be of real importance to many member of the house and will make myself available to all member who have complex consular case that they wish to discuss with this debate be long overdue and we have use the time well we should have regular debate on this issue the government should set aside time for back benchers to debate what be happen to constituent who have be arbitrarily arrest and more widely to british citizen who be unlawfully detain that should be regular occurrence and there should be regular report in my opening remark call for regular report from the government on the status of those individual hope that the minister will take that request away and that ministers will initiate debate on this issue rather than wait for back benchers to do so that would give we real sense of the concern and the direct action that be be take number of issue be raise by colleague from across the house first there be call for regular envoy who would be directly involve in these case so that the family always feel informed and so that there be go to individual who everybody know and who possess knowledge and understanding include of the policy that the government have initiate it would be helpful if the government make it clear that that be what they want to do the chair of the foreign affairs committee speak about make sure that we link this issue with trade and that be very viable we have different department be secretary of state once and we deal in separate little silo and no one quite know what the other be do it be clear from the debate that everybody share the view that it be time for there to be concentration of effort so that all power be bring to bear on foreign government and every angle be use trade investment and ultimately sanction we have magnitsky sanction legislation we know now from what have happen around the world that what really concern individual be the idea that they will be sanction sanction by government in the democratic world who will refuse they access to their financial institution and all the other pleasure they may derive from be in place like the uk europe or the united states this be very efficient tool but it be not use much by the uk government and it should be use more in hong kong china have trash the sino british agreement and have arrest number of people it have just incarcerate democracy campaigner in ghastly fashion have hold they for three year before eventually give they their sentence jimmy lai in appal treatment languish in isolation from other and we the uk who set the agreement with china have sanction not one single person responsible for any of the many abuse america have sanction at least of the high official this show this be the main issue that arise from the debate why people in britain believe that british government of all hue through the foreign office do not do as much as they should that have to be counter whether it be correct or not it need to be answer that be the final point of the debate finally want to stress on every give occasion that our british passport give to those who be british citizen whether or not they be dual national have on its inside page demand not request and sometimes we in this house wonder about that as one foreign minister after another whether conservative or labour arrive on the front bench none ever make that statement british citizen require and demand that right of access to the consulate one of the minister responsibility so that they can have their issue deal with we need to know that that have be demand not request nor negotiate demand as that be right that we have hope the minister will take away with he the sense that there be genuine concern here about the behaviour of successive government in this matter question put and agree to resolve that this house be concern by the number of arbitrarily detain british national at risk of human right abuse abroad and the apparent lack of active support for those detain and call on the foreign commonwealth and development office to provide regular report on when it last raise the case of those people with its international counterpart improve public transport beg to move that this house have consider the matter of improve public transport begin by thank the backbench business committee for schedule this important and timely debate the government have recognise the need for modal shift away from car to public transport but we be still long way from achieve this aspiration the government aim to change the way the railway and bus service operate in the uk so we stand at crossroad make it increasingly important that we head in the right direction as member will know transport be key contributor to climate change and the release of greenhouse gas the transport sector be responsible for more than quarter of total uk emission and be the single most polluting domestic sector but all public transport combine bus tram share mobility account for only of these emission with that number fall every year improved public transport play huge role in deliver growth to local and regional community but all too often public transport be barrier to economic inclusion in rural area we know that well local integrate transport system deliver growth and opportunity two of the government five mission datum from the local government association find that improvement in public transport journey time could support nearly reduction in employment deprivation the government own return on investment tool show that help someone back into work provide boost to their income while the national government benefit by and wide society by my hon friend be make an excellent speech do she agree that the single big reason that people fail to access work in rural area be public transport the figure that she have give be not just number it benefit somebody whole way of life if they can access work because they can catch the bus there entirely agree and will address that point in my speech poor public transport compound social ill while the unreliability inaccessibility and lack of integration in rural britain prevent people from trust that it can get they where they need to go when they need to go there and crucially that they can get home again somerset have the bad bus service in the country force community into isolation or lock they into expensive and pollute car usage my constituent from area that be currently serve by the railway be concerned about the impact of build old oak common and how it will disrupt travel to london many resident who travel from castle cary to london face up to decade of disruption as result of those work would welcome it if the minister comment on how that will be mitigate would also like to mention the future of south western railway after the decision be make recently to renationalise the company in may it will be the large train operate company ever to be nationalise in the uk and that will happen before great british railways the body that will oversee the public operator be operational in just few month the department will in effect take responsibility for hundred of million of extra journey and my constituent travel on the exeter st david to waterloo line from templecombe or nearby station be anxious about the future of the train that they rely on would welcome it if the minister comment on that too have speak many time in this place about the reintroduction of station in the somerton and langport area and thank the langport transport group for its hard work and tenacity in try to bring railway station to the area after it lose its station during the beeching cut of the the somerton and langport area have the long stretch of rail between london and cornwall that be not serve by railway station the langport transport group prepare proposal to the restore your railway fund and win to develop strategic outline case alongside somerset council which they submit in february despite this huge effort they have never hear back even after press both the former prime minister and the transport secretary in the last parliament for an answer now that that scheme have be cancel by the chancellor local resident feel that they be in limbo have railway station in the somerton and langport area make so much sense it would serve the people who live nearby who currently be not serve by the railway line that run right through their community nearby station such as castle cary taunton bridgwater and yeovil junction be all at least to mile away there be no direct bus to castle cary or taunton where it be then hike to the near station that be hardly an incentive to travel and it illustrate the lack of integrated public transport in somerset topic will speak on later railway station in the area would do more than connect resident to the rail line it could also boost the local economy bring in more visitor we have see nearby passenger number at castle cary the official railway station for the glastonbury festival jump massively in recent year from in to in may have slight bias but there be so many reason for people to stop and visit the area if only there be train station for example there be the river parrett trail scenic mile walk that be home to some of lowland england most beautiful and unchanged landscape as mention the proposal be cast into doubt after the government announce the cancellation of the restore your railway fund in the summer we be still wait for an update on what will happen to the project would welcome the minister comment regard the somerton and langport railway thank my hon friend for raise such an important topic for we all and in particular for my constituent in bicester and woodstock after the conservative lead administration cut all direct bus funding in our area in be proud that liberal democrats have reinstate community bus service do she agree that it be incredibly important that the government new plan for public transport not only focus on metropolitan area but provide adequate funding so that these dislocate area can access community bus transport use new technology for demand lead and cost effective service for our resident thank my hon friend for his intervention that be vital for rural area have excellent community transport provider in glastonbury and somerton there be wincanton community transport and across somerset we have the slinky bus that provide on demand service they be crucial for people who need to get to surgery appointment and even their job as well as for get people out and about and break down that rural isolation move on to integrated transport if we must wait long for station in the langport and somerton area it be crucial that in the meantime the area receive an integrate public transport system to nearby railway station in the form of rail bus link the former transport secretary the right hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh on the day before her departure set out vision for more integrate public transport system hope that the new secretary of state will keep those aim alive as that be desperately need in somerset fragmented transport leave traveller try to get from wincanton to castle cary have to take bus journey and then walk half mile to the station to catch train with no integration between the bus timetable and the train time in nearby devon local bus operator the council and great western railway have work together to launch rail bus link with improved timetable that correspond with mainline train service alongside improve service brand visibility that serve as an example of how integrate rail bus link can work in rural area and service community that do not have train station thank my hon friend for bring this important debate to the chamber in my constituency gwr have be work with the borough and county council on new cycle link network rail unfortunately be singularly block the development that strategic cycle link will probably not be complete unless network rail which own the land get out the way do she agree that different arm of government need to be work together much more strongly and that cultural change in network rail be require if we be to solve these problem in public transport and active travel wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend integration between public transport and active travel be vital he and live in beautiful part of the world which frankly more people should get out and enjoy on two wheel or on two foot there be huge opportunity to improve bus service around the country and especially in somerset where they be almost endless mind you the starting point be quite low in somerset county council bus service improvement plan bid acknowledge that somerset have the worst rat bus service in the country at the time and that be after year of lack of investment under conservative lead administration bus provision be poor and unreliable for example the bus route which run through glastonbury and somerton connect taunton to yeovil lack an evening or saturday service that leave people who might work unpredictable or unsociable hour unable to trust the bus service and reliant on private car cherie in glastonbury tell that she have to wait for an hour for her bus home from work so despite finish at pm she do not get home until nearly half past if she be to drive it would take she minute the unreliability of bus combine with the poor state of bus stop and public information provide major hurdle for bus user thank somerset bus partnership for its unrelenting work to improve that have hold more than bus stall to inform local people about their near service fill an information gap that have sadly be leave by the service provider most bus stop do not have print sign timetable or real time information and often poor mobile connectivity in rural area make it difficult for people to access information online that be confirm recently by iain who tell that the print bus timetable in glastonbury be barely legible that be so disappointing even small intervention could create vastly important change that would support bus service campaign for better transport survey have find that of people would use more bus if they have well information at bus stop but the onus on provide that information be sadly lack unlike rail where there be national standard that mandate that certain level of information be provide at station there be no equivalent for bus stop every rail station in britain have provision for real time information but we be million mile away from achieve similar provision for our bus network bus user need certainty but the availability of up to date co ordinate information on the bus network be lack at the good of time and existent at the bad of time that must change one of the major barrier prevent simple thing like clear information be the fractured nature of bus funding the previous government competitive strategy turn funding into postcode lottery with only of eligible local authority receive any of the billion of bsip funding announce in the liberal democrats have be call for simplified system of bus funding that could deliver route where there be local need funding be unequal and fractured somerset council receive around per head of funding for bus yet local authority across the country get double that amount the former transport secretary recently announce big increase in bus funding with somerset council receive million the increase be very welcome but it will not go far enough to fix the gap hole in our bus provision somerset council also await guidance from the government on what the money can be use for so that it can prioritise where the need be great the previous transport secretary be keen for local authority to decide where the money be most need and hope that that remain the case the government vision for the future of bus appear to be base around franchising and deliver london style bus around the country as state well bus be key to achieve modal shift hit net zero target and deliver opportunity and growth but with the local authority landscape as it be franchising simply be not an option in rural area if there be not significant funding franchising be no more than pipe dream for rural authority somerset council have only three officer to deal with public transport which be not enough people power to run such an operation that be not an anomaly but local authority standard if the current situation do not work for rural area what be the vision hope that the recent removal of the bus fare cap be not the start of thing to come for rural area give the nature of rural bus route journey be long and people travel far if the now cap be to be remove it would be disastrous for rural area as price would rise beyond affordable rate very quickly and disincentivise regular bus patronage after the fare increase one constituent from north cadbury write to concerned about the impact it will have on the future of the no bus from yeovil to shepton mallet and the no in wincanton which be both face cancellation those route and many like they be vital for social and economic outcome in the last session introduce the public transport rural areas bill which would have create minimum service level ensure that resident can access site of employment education and leisure believe that those measure be truly need for rural area do the hon lady accept that the previous government have not actually fund the fare cap beyond the current period therefore we have cap on bus fare so that people do not to end up with exponential fare rise in the next spending period the point be that if price go up any far patronage on bus will go down and in rural area we travel far and long it be difficult to incentivise people to use bus in rural area so we need to get this right and increase fare will not encourage more people to get out of their car and on to public transport local authority have duty to outline route that can not run commercially but be vital to improve social outcome or support economic activity but there be no duty on they to fund those route after the general election there be suggestion that the government would create safeguard to make it hard for route to be cut and the well bus bill be the perfect opportunity to deliver that the previous government commit to deliver guidance on the meaning and role of socially necessary service expand the category to include economically necessary service but unsurprisingly they fail to provide it leave much need bus route in danger hope the minister will take this up and provide some guidance improve public transport be essential the government have state their intention to improve it but so much remain unclear especially for rural area which see poor service and high cost unfortunately without investment and smart choice that will continue to be the reality the reversal of these trend be crucial and look forward to hear the minister response call alex mayer to make her maiden speech be delighted to be call to give my maiden speech and do so with sense of trepidation and excitement which imagine that many new mp feel it have strike that maiden speech be little like bus you wait age and then of they turn up at once beg your indulgence madam deputy speaker and ask you to listen to one more as we near the end of this journey as hon member will know the excellent house of commons library helpfully provide we with the maiden speech of our last two predecessor to give we feel for this place and to allow we to acknowledge the work of those who come before we mr selous serve for whopping year and pay tribute to his work as an assiduous constituency representative who stand up for what he believe in discover in his maiden speech that he in turn refer to his predecessor who serve for year who in turn hark back to the member who come before he the last labour mp for the area who be elect back in clearly be year that be rather good for team in red albeit follow by rather too many year of hurt history show we how rarely change come for these community yet change be desperately need on lifting as have meet worker who have be spat at threaten with needle and even gun on the lack of healthcare facility include in houghton regis and leighton linslade on sewage pollute our waterway and on transport be delighted to be member of the transport committee and transport be the subject of the debate which congratulate the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke on securing my constituency have long history of transport innovation it have britain old road date back to prehistoric time the icknield way which run through the constituency it have the grand union canal the freight superhighway of its day leighton buzzard railway once transport sand from quarry and be now much love tourism attraction go full steam ahead more recently we gain one of the long guide busway in europe which hope one day can be extend that bring neatly to the topic of bus and encourage more people to switch on to they which be so vital in this time of climate emergency welcome the bsip investment announce recently by the government and look forward to hear more from the minister about plan to allow more local area to have smoother path to franchising be keen for the minister to look carefully at transport governance london and greater manchester which have franchise already have also historically have alignment of transport power resource and capacity all in one centralised place passenger transport executive and their equivalent can accelerate the delivery of transport plan and play crucial role in unlock regional economic growth for year such structure have benefit from much high level of control and co ordination of bus they also benefit from run over much more logical functional economic geography outside such area transport power be hold in many different place and they require number of organisation to independently agree reform to enact change that can mean for example that bus stop which be surely the window to the soul of bus can be own by an organisation with no say in how the bus service itself be run in many place in the country highway and transport power be split we perhaps need more passenger transport executive although the urban transport group advise that the last passenger transport executive be establish so long ago not quite so long ago as when labour mp last represent dunstable and leighton buzzard that the mechanic around establish new one be unclear in any case we need governance that be fit for the century with the right delegate function be grant to passenger transport executive or equivalent the establishment of an executive function to speed up decision making and delivery that make the difference it need to be base on geography that reflect travel pattern as well as wide social and economic geography and which give large enough base to raise farebox income on geography argue that there need to be possibility to franchise in area large than local transport authority give that franchising be not entirely silver bullet urge the minister to look at the geography of enhance partnership as well it be only one bus but the which travel from luton to milton keynes via dunstable and leighton buzzard go through three separate enhance partnership area finally thank grant palmer arriva and first which have invite aboard their bus recently and dawsongroup for bring double decker bus just outside parliament for catch the bus month which many hon member from across the house come to support it be my belief really that every month should be catch the bus month urge all hon member to get on board and back our local bus all year round congratulate the hon member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer on her maiden speech which be lovely to hear she keep on the theme of bus as well which be very impressive there be puzzle with rural bus service that need to be solve local resident will all say they be desperate to save their village bus service from closure yet the local operator will say that footfall keep go down year on year and there simply be not enough public subsidy to fill the gap if everyone want to use the bus why be they not actually do it the answer be mix of two thing it be partly the price but even more so it be the service service frequency do not sufficiently meet the need of resident so they do not take the bus bus service have be in decline ever since thatcher privatisation in the while increase car use be always go to have an impact bus service should have bottom out year ago in practice what we have leave today be mostly legacy route design to meet the need of community from decade ago we have see process of death by thousand cut with incremental cut in frequency make the bus option less user friendly every year across many village in my constituency of horsham it be just not practical any more to rely on bus to get to work when survey in more than of west sussex resident say they do not use the bus due to lack of route option or the infrequency of service gradually anyone who need dependable public transport be force out of rural area to be replace by car user which in turn reduce bus usage even far and the downward spiral continue as result in horsham and across west sussex the local authority have for many year preside over policy of manage decline with no serious attempt to reverse or even stabilise thing this summer the resident of partridge green village in the south of my constituency be surprised to discover that they be about to lose their direct link to horsham via the no bus they learn this with just couple of week notice nobody consult they or warn they they find it out only by study the new bus timetable when it be issue public anger be mainly direct at the local bus operator but have to ask what do we actually expect to happen it be private company that need to make profit and the figure say that the cut have to be make we can not expect private company to behave like social enterprise partridge green resident react to the news with an impressive public campaign which be still ongoing attend large public meeting that have fair percentage of the entire village population cram into the local church and something hear there really strike if only the resident have know the service be in danger they would have get together to help it either by use the bus more frequently themselves or by find some other compromise however west sussex county council give the resident no warning so they never have chance this be the killer app we be miss out on we need to harness the passion of community to protect their local amenity loss of bus service be not the only problem these community face village be suffer from the removal of banking service shop pharmacy post office pub you name it they know they be in battle but they be also really motivated to help if only we actually ask they that may be part of the answer to the long term decline in service we need to start by ask what kind of service resident actually want and what they would use if it actually exist welcome government promise of increase local funding and control over public transport but hope the government will be realistic in their assessment of local authority capability when two fifth of council be on the verge of bankruptcy we have be fight long defensive battle and frankly we have be lose if we be to have any hope of reverse that we need mechanism to go back to the people who actually live in these village today and reconstruct the service from the ground up thank the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke for secure the debate when originally sign up to speak in it it be about the south west do not know what change but obviously national transport be very important feel that the south west do sometimes get miss in conversation but hope that with the appointment of my right hon friend the member for swindon south heidi alexander as transport secretary that might change little bit after some of the speech we have hear today it will come as no shock to anyone that be go to talk about rural transport and the need for integration this issue be an odd one for my constituency have an urban area of swindon and then rural area which include inglesham highworth blunsdon and castle eaton the two area be completely different we have one bus company and in the urban area of swindon we get it right do not get complaint from resident sometimes in queens drive get complaint about double decker look into garden but at least there be still double decker go past when speak to rural resident however they often raise the point that they want and need to use public transport it be good for their child and for access to education hospital and the town centre but they simply can not and that be force they to use car will keep my speech brief because lot of member want to talk but do the house not agree that if we be to incentivise people to ditch the car and get on public transport we need an integrate transport system that focus on rural area to ensure we can get access to bus when we need they be very grateful to my hon friend the member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke for secure the debate on this important topic as the member for the guildford constituency could probably bore for the south east of england when it come to the public transport challenge we face recognise that in comparison with colleague from across the house we do have very good public transport but it still be not good enough and my resident regularly get in touch with to tell so for too long our transport network be neglect by the previous conservative government leave transport user frustrate by delay poor accessibility and high cost for we to achieve the greener fair and more thriving future that be sure all of we here want for our community high quality public transport be essential in my consistency of guildford we have two long propose railway station guildford west and merrow these station be first suggest year ago and we have have barely any progress the main reason funding or rather the lack of funding for those not in the know build railway station cost upwards of million with at least half of that spend on planning before single shovel break the ground that financial barrier have leave resident wait far long than they should for essential infrastructure yet even as we struggle to deliver new station exist one remain inaccessible for too many be of course talk about the issue of step free access in my constituency station such as clandon effingham junction and horsley still lack basic accessibility for my resident to be able to access the train in their rural area instead they have to go to other large place such as guildford and dorking we must support those in wheelchair but step free access be also about make life easy for parent with pram people with invisible mobility challenge and anyone who find step barrier without do so we prevent people from choose green public transport that be matter of fairness and inclusion but just like the new station it come with significant price tag with the news this week that south western railway will be move to public ownership next year it be my sincere hope that the urgent improvement we need will start to take place and we will see an end to accessibility desert but railway be just one part of the public transport puzzle in the village of my constituency like many rural and semi rural area bus be lifeline for resident and business yet far too often route be be cut service be deeply unreliable and community be be leave isolate from our extensive experience in local government those of we on the liberal democrat benches know that local solution work well that be why personally would like the government to look at empower borough district town and parish council to run their own localise bus service not just the county level transport authority these council know their community and can deliver the target service that people need have speak to people run some of the large town and parish council and they would like at least the opportunity to consider commercial shuttle bus service some of they have the financial potential to do so but can not because it be currently illegal it be in the gift of the government to change that along with number of my liberal democrat colleague have campaign for many year for solution to our public transport woe my constituent completely understand the frustration share by everyone else in the country about the delay and the difficulty that result from the inadequacy of public transport the answer be of course investment have say this before to conservative colleague and say it again now please do be shy borrow our idea and with those idea for our manifesto be always fully cost we can deliver railway station we can deliver step free access and we can deliver bus for resident community and business so that our community can thrive thank the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke for initiate the debate and also commend my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer for her excellent maiden speech public transport include bus be bit of passion of mine be from stroud and there be many small village in my constituency include dursley and wotton under edge to name just two so know that public transport be about more than infrastructure it represent range of opportunity it be about equality and community and that be particularly true of rural area because it tend to run as lifeline for many local resident under successive conservative governments rural bus service have be run down and it be interesting today to observe the attention be pay to the subject of public transport on the opposition benches there have be staggering reduction in bus service since and in rural area there be million shortfall however to answer the hon lady question be encourage by the fact that we be invest billion in improve bus service include million designate for gloucestershire as little aside may mention stroudwater station which be close in the agree with the hon lady about small railway station of that kind they cost great deal to develop but when money allow and when we have get ourselves out of our current financial hole it will be fantastic if we can invest in small station the impact of nearly four decade of deregulation on our public transport system have leave many community strip of any public transport or at the very least of any accessibility or affordable bus service be therefore delighted that this government plan to restore power to local community enable local leader to set fare determine route and establish timetable take control away from unaccountable private operator however urge the minister to confirm that rural area without an elect mayor will have equal opportunity to benefit from the shift towards community control bus service wotton under edge have lifeline of bus service the go south to bristol the problem be that it cross boundary line between combine authority area and gloucestershire its cancellation have cause havoc for schoolchildren as well as those who can not get to work can not get to doctor surgery and can not get to hospital people have write to say they have have to turn down job offer that be how important rural bus service be key issue in this instance be the lack of co ordination between local authority it seem petty but this be major problem the funding for that cross border bus service be lose because local leader fail to reach an agreement that be an example of the extent to which fragmentation can affect rural public transport let end by describe one of the pleasure of my week leave this place take the train to stroud and then get on to my favourite bus the sit on the top and ride over selsley common to my home it be an utter joy and joy that be share by my two year old granddaughter who absolutely love bus so let we develop rural public transport and take it back to what it be in the past thank my hon friend the member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke for secure this debate our public transport service have be run down for year because of the previous conservative government and many rural community across my thornbury and yate constituency have see their vital bus service disappear to rub salt into the wound we have see money spend on gimmick that be aim at deliver headline rather than save the service we rely on my constituent be look forward to the new government offer they hope but one of their first action be to hike the bus fare cap which be so vital in rural area where journey be long and fractured and the government have commit to the cap only for the next year welcome the announcement of more funding for service that be subsidise by combined and local authority but for it to be effective it must be target at restore our rural service rather than be funnel into already well serve urban area in the west of england funding have be prioritise for urban area such as bristol where increase the frequency of service boost the number of passenger journey more as long as the focus be purely on passenger journey number rather than ensure that everyone have basic minimum service that enable access to work education and health service our rural area will miss out one of the half bake solution to the reduction in mainstream regularly schedule service have be to roll out an on demand bus service call westlink although on demand service can work westlink be be use locally to do far more than any on demand service can reasonably be expect to do and the delivery of the service have be poor bad experience have lead to people lose confidence in it because no one want to be strand and to have to pay fortune for taxi people have tell that they have book the service to get from to only to find that they be the only passenger on board the situation be even more ridiculous when we consider that some westlink service be fill the gap leave by the axing of bus route that child and teenager use to get to school or college parent repeatedly have to call up to book what should be consistent daily service to get young people to and from their place of learn it be simply waste of time and resource to manage the service in this way to quote one parent know there be westlink available to book every day but with the westlink only able to have small number of passenger and it be never on time or take we somewhere completely different before take we to school it leave parent with the fear of be fin have try in vain to raise this issue with the west of england combine authority both in my time in this place and in my previous role as the leader of south gloucestershire council but each time we be meet with the same answer there no funding that show the core weakness of the system route that be commercially sustainable be run by bus company which absorb the profit and the less use but equally important rural route be leave in the hand of local authority local government have have its funding cut to the bone during more than decade of conservative rule in westminster and it simply can not magic up extra money to keep the bus run when raise the issue of use funding to provide minimum service level for rural area in the house few week ago the then transport secretary the right hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh agree with hope that the minister will echo that agreement today also hope that the minister will agree that regardless of whether new franchising power be take up my hon friend the member for glastonbury and somerton have highlight the difficulty local councillor should be involve in decision making as councillor for many year know how valuable their local knowledge can be in avoid disastrous route and timetable change that make sense to those sit in the bus operator office the yate and district transport forum in my area be good example of local representative work with operator but all too often councillor find out about change at the same time as resident when it be too late to intervene agree with the hon member for stroud dr opher about the need to understand that whatever boundary one choose for transport service some people will want to cross it and in the case of the it be significant number of people have have similar message about people inability to get to job the impact on people travel to katharine lady berkeley school and so forth it be important that the minister provide clarity on the issue of cross boundary service will finish by briefly touch on railway we be lucky enough to have some local line and rail service in my area but there be no joined up approach to ensure that people live in village like hawkesbury upton who take bus to the railway station in yate will get there in time to catch the next schedule train this lack of an ecosystem hold we back our service operate disjointedly which be why people simply do not feel that they can rely on public transport to get around in addition we need to increase the number of rail service have be push for the reopening of station at charfield and coalpit heath as new solution for people travel to the grow number of job at severnside and have be push for the government to guarantee funding to keep half hourly train run through yate all in all we need clear and connected plan to improve our public transport network in order to fix the rot that have set in after year of conservative cut and neglect and to ensure that everyone have regular service that they can depend upon it be pleasure to follow the maiden speech of my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer and congratulate the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke on secure this debate public transport in leeds south west and morley be lifeline for many of my constituent and will focus on bus travel today as it be the no transport issue that my constituent raise with have plenty of content on the railway and the tram but will leave that for another time without bus travel many more rural community such as those in ardsley robin hood thorpe and lofthouse in my constituency simply would not have the mean to access essential service as other member have say in farnley and wortley on the other side of my constituency we depend on small number of bus service which leave we far more expose when those service fail morley despite be the large population centre in my constituency be not immune to all the problem we have come to associate with bus travel have rely heavily on the bus service in churwell and morley the and the get to school year ago and remember be frustrate with the service even then swear that if be ever in position to do something about it would which be why be very grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to be part of this labour government we need public transport system on which we can rely we need to try something different because the status quo obviously be not work the ardsley and robin hood council ward in my constituency have no town centre and part of it be very remote so bus be essential for resident who do not have car we do not have reliable route into leeds city centre either and despite all this route keep be cut include very recently by private provider leave resident isolate these route include the service that go through east ardsley into tingley and right through to wakefield city centre fortunately thank to the work of local councillor and the west yorkshire combine authority we have manage to find new provider for the route start in january obviously this count as victory for local resident but we can not rely on such stick plaster solution we can not scrabble around to find new private provider every time somebody cut bus route that be not to say that all private bus company be bad far from it in my previous role as councillor for farnley and wortley be very happy to work with first in leeds on deal with antisocial behaviour on the route that go through my ward be so grateful for the work of first and the police to end that antisocial behaviour and restore the bus route first have always be willing to engage with on issue affect its bus route even when it have not be able to solve the problem however do not want to rely on the hope that every private provider be as willing to engage with as first have be we all know that private provider have to cut route that be not profitable or subsidise or if they go bankrupt even if those route be essential to vulnerable community that be why we need long term solution west yorkshire be very fortunate to have mayor tracy brabin who have put public transport at the heart of her mission to change how we get around our region welcome the news that franchising system will be introduce in west yorkshire in that can not come soon enough it will give we direct control over the bus company and the bus route so that we can finally put people before profit in our public transport system mayor brabin work closely align with this government strong commitment to fix the broken bus network across our country the new bus bill will end the postcode lottery of bus service and deliver the big overhaul to our bus system in year while that move be welcome by my constituent in leeds south west and morley it be imperative that we continue to ensure that bus remain sustainable that be why welcome the billion of investment in bus funding recently announce by the government include million for west yorkshire that have help we to extend the price cap for the whole of and to secure route like the respect lot of the point make by liberal democrat members but point out that whereas the bus fare cap be go to be abolish next year new cap have be introduce because of the action of this government yes it be high but it be none the less cap that will keep exponential fare rise down return to leeds predict that the next two year will be vital to our bus network as we build towards franchising in we must sustain good level of service until that date and use every tool in our arsenal to do so urge my constituent to continue to contact with problem relate to the bus network in leeds south west and morley will work with councillor of every party and with the west yorkshire combine authority to deal with the problem that we encounter before franchising the minister be one of my neighbour and have hear set out all the argument to do with and problem in my constituency and as well as some of the solution can he tell if there be any other tool that can use to help my constituent in the build up to franchising in should problem arise before that date to conclude we can not understate the significance of effective public transport community in leeds south west and morley rely on it can tell they that we be genuinely get on with the job of fix our bus network it be time that my constituent have access to the public transport that they deserve congratulate the hon member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer on her excellent maiden speech when be first elect think it would be difficult to get to know my liberal democrat colleague but realise that the challenge be considerably big for those on the labour benches so wish she well with that congratulate my hon friend and neighbour the member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke on secure this important debate pay tribute to she and her colleague on somerset council for their work over recent year in very difficult circumstance the previous government may have introduce the bus fare cap but that do not go far enough to outweigh the decimation of public transport and bus service over decade in this country both by central government and somerset county council which cut service throughout somerset for example in shortly before the liberal democrats take control of somerset the conservative county council propose close the park and ride service in taunton park and ride be vital to the whole system of integrated public transport and be an innovation of the noughtie build by liberal democrat council although there be plan for the closure of the park and ride service my colleague who run the district council step up and save it they restructure fare and the service be now once again profitable and do not require subsidy that show that with commitment to public transport and political will such service can be make viable and can be sustain during these year of real challenge for local government give credit to somerset council for bring back night bus be delighted to meet the first night bus out of taunton which mean we can now travel between taunton and wellington in my constituency until midnight every night on weekday be out there with mike drive his first night bus last year it be fantastic improvement the fare cap in taunton mean that ticket be reduce to not just shockingly follow privatisation which be refer to by my hon friend the member for horsham john milne the company close the bus station in taunton and sell it off be delighted that the council be bring forward plan to have transport hub once again in taunton town centre so that people do not have to stand shiver on pavement in the county town get rain on to catch bus credit the government for the million in bus service improvement plan funding which be genuinely welcome we would obviously have like more and it be disappointing to see the bus cap increase to as the hon member for east thanet rightly point out no money be pledge to support that service by the last government understand the challenge but we would have tax big bank and big energy company more as my hon friend the member for guildford zöe franklin point out so that we could fund some of these thing to high level before leave bus service must mention that in my constituency of taunton and wellington there be one part of somerset where young people student get no discount at all on their bus fare if they want to attend college as sixth former in my part of somerset they have to pay per year just to get there and back that be prohibitively high bus fare to pay to get to college be work closely with councillor on somerset council and hope it will be possible to bring forward discount scheme for student in our part of somerset like those that exist in other part of somerset and other part of the country will move on to the vital importance of rail in taunton and wellington and my part of somerset we have the fantastic west somerset steam railway which invite all hon member to come and visit it take we from bishops lydeard just outside taunton down to minehead and the famous butlin know that all member will want to go there and they can enjoy the steam journey over to it strategic outline business case have recently be submit by west somerset railway to the department for transport to connect that railway with taunton station so that it would have mainline station connection provide both commuter service to bishops lydeard on the edge of taunton and direct access to one of the good heritage railway in the country perhaps more important than any of those thing be the wellington and cullompton station project recognise that there be station opening project across the country that members across the house will be champion as their favourite but must say that my understanding of the wellington and cullompton station project be that because it be two station project that would deliver two station in one it have the good benefit cost ratio of any railway station reopen project in the country at say that like understand treasury benefit cost ratio number only wish that be true be reliably inform however that anything above one be really high benefit cost ratio on that ground alone the project should qualify for funding and it would bring million of benefit to the local economy after all growth be vital to the whole country and reopen wellington station would unlock thousand of home around wellington we have town council that want wellington to thrive and grow the project to bring that railway station be very close to get shovel in the ground in july the project have reach its final business case the detailed design be ongoing there be just small amount of money need to complete it and then the government freeze the whole programme however be assure by the chancellor of the exchequer in the budget debate that the station would go ahead we be still wait to hear why the most financially beneficial station reopen project in the country have not yet get the go ahead be very grateful to lord hendy the minister for rail for the two meeting we have have know that the government be supportive and sympathetic but we need this project to get back on track be sorry but it be impossible to avoid railway pun in this debate the station be so ready to be build we have lot of third party funding come in the access road and the car park be fund by third party developer cullompton in the neighbouring constituency be put in similar third party funding we urgently need that project to go ahead we wish to secure the economic growth that somerset need but we have lose billion worth of transport project over the past few month the and the have be cancel we desperately need bypass for the village of thornfalcon and henlade which that project would have complete with all these project be take away surely it be time that we receive the funding for the new station project at wellington and cullompton with all its excellent economic growth impact congratulate the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke on secure this debate she have create safe space where all us tram bus and train nerd can come together without fear of persecution and we should be grateful for that it be great to share this debate with my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer she have already prove herself to be very diligent member of the transport committee congratulate she on her maiden speech today well do this be welcome debate in the few year run up to the general election the public discourse around transport feel like we be stick in narrative about cyclist versus driver as if they be not the same people lot of the time and also about low traffic neighbourhood what we should have be speak about be public transport if we be serious about grow the economy cut congestion reduce climate emission and create more equal society we should be talk about public transport generally and bus specifically so far the speech today have focus on the thing that be not work so want to talk about something that be work the bus service in edinburgh hopefully we can draw some lesson from that the service be not without its challenge and it could be well but it be none the less pretty good people who arrive in london for the first time say that one of the thing that define london for they be the tube it be the memory they take away and what they speak to people about they buy shirt and all the rest of it in edinburgh it be the bus that define we always say that our excellent bus service define the city just as much as the castle do so what be this bus service like people can travel on any route in the city as far as they like for so we have that cap the driver be among the well pay driver in the country the workforce be heavily unionised think union membership be well over that be not challenge because the union work in complete partnership with the manage director and the management team it be really good example have the lothian buses longstone garage in my constituency the staff there be key to lothian buses become the bus operator of the year in the uk invite the minister to come along and visit the garage and meet the staff and the management team at his convenience what always say be that if people get on the bus they will see all of edinburgh there be of course the fantastic view the castle be not quite in my constituency but it can be see from bus in my constituency so will claim it the people who use the bus service in edinburgh be complete cross section of the population young old rich and less affluent people be all there together on the bus which be fantastic not every city can claim that my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher point out that the view from the top deck of his bus be fantastic want to put it on the record that the good seat in bus be on the top deck right at the front above the driver see that there be broad agreement it be not very controversial which be excellent the bus service in edinburgh receive no real subsidy from the local authority or the government apart from for old people and young people it actually provide dividend to the council which own the service last year it give million dividend back to the city it be fantastic service that be cheap have well pay staff and pay dividend back to its owner what be the secret to its success would say that it be public ownership do not think that all these thing be coincidence that the service just happen to be publicly own public ownership be at the heart of it there be an unwritten social contract between lothian buses and the city it provide network that support the city as whole it do not focus as private operator would just on the route that make it lot of money and forget about the rest of the city it provide the network and there be kind of cross subsidy within it whereby less viable route be support by the more well use route that be really important particularly if we want to create more equal city use transport since the election the discussion about franchising in england have be really powerful we already have those power in scotland but it have take time for they to be fully use and there be funding issue right across england there be real excitement about the use of franchising power my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard make the case for get the balance of those power absolutely right so that we can move these scheme forward at pace that be really important it be not just about give local authority franchise power or even the funding to deliver the service quickly the other thing that we have to think about be ensure that our local authority and local leader be able to put priority measure in place on the ground for our bus to move around the city quickly that mean bus lane and priority measure at junction so that we can keep people move in edinburgh there be much more that we need to do we repeatedly ask the scottish government for more funding to make that happen fast in edinburgh around of trip inside the city be on bus but the percentage of the road space that be allocate just to bus be absolutely tiny and every square metre of it be hard fight for franchising alone will not solve this issue we have to support the deployment of these scheme right across the uk when it come to bus lane and priority measure at junction we need to think about the economy congestion and climate and create more equal city we must not be too reactionary but think about the benefit that well bus service can bring to we all and engage in consultation with the community on that basis congratulate the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke on secure this important debate it be pleasure to hear the maiden speech of my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer wonderful stuff as many member have do massively welcome the debate it be hugely important topic public transport be vital to not only the connectivity and economic growth of our community but the wellbeing of our resident for so many people who can not afford car public transport be lifeline allow they to get to work to school to see friend and family and to visit doctor and hospital without good reliable public transport link our community suffer as so many sadly do today in my constituency of rossendale and darwen it be vital that we get to grip with this issue so be encourage by the work that the government have do so far to begin the work of rebuild our public transport link after the stark disinterest of the previous government welcome the trans pennine route upgrade which will ensure that our key town in the north be well connect with fast and more frequent train with that great connectivity and mobility we can begin to address the constraint that have hold back our northern economy for many year alongside that be pleased to see the commitment to furth million for transport link outside of city that be much need with line like those serve darwen in my constituency cry out for improvement as they suffer constant cancellation and delay also hope that this will be an opportunity to address leave behind area such as rossendale where one in four of my resident commute into manchester and yet we be the only local authority area in the north without any sort of commuter rail link that result in of journey be by car with all the resultant congestion and air pollution the city valley rail link propose by our borough council and county council would be an absolute game changer it would take half million car off the road and enable up to job to it be the definition of no brainer and an example of exactly the sort of connectivity issue that we need to address if we be to genuinely deliver on our growth mission similarly be delighted to see the government recent commitment to billion of funding to support our local bus network with area in my constituency receive million of pound in support we can now begin the vital work of strengthen our bus route many of which have face year of unending cut in my constituency village such as edgeworth edenfield and weir have long feel cut off and we need to judge the value of restore those connection for not just short term passenger number but with consideration of all the social wellbee and economic benefit that come from connect remote community with the service training and employment opportunity they need recently write to lancashire county council and blackburn with darwen council call on the leadership to work with to ensure the new funding be use to address the long stand connectivity issue and reiterate that call now in rossendale and darwen the bus issue be compound by cross border challenge and be pleased to see other colleague recognise that fundamental issue with many key service cross between lancashire west yorkshire and greater manchester the local government area have not traditionally work well together and we have suffer from that lack of join up thinking we can not discuss improve transport link without discuss improvement to local authority structure as we be see in manchester with the bee network an empower mayor and an effective combine authority can turbocharge the development of efficient reactive join up and innovative transport infrastructure that serve resident and grow the economy yet in county such as lancashire with an out of date two tier structure and no mayor we lack strong voice and coherent join up transport strategy that be why there be press need central to any effort to tangibly improve public transport to pursue fully fledged devolution deal for every area of the country only with empower local leader work together to quickly recognise local need and opportunity can we have the sort of public transport system that our country and my resident in rossendale and darwen need congratulate the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke on secure the debate and my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer on her maiden speech it be an exciting speech to get off the list be fortunate enough to be londoner and not just any londoner but one lucky enough to be from south of the river which be the right side but have the good sense to marry northerner hear hear there you go as londoner who grow up with well integrate well run and efficient public transport system know when raise issue around under investment from the government into our service there will be colleague who represent constituency such as the one my husband grow up in who have to wait an hour for bus to the near town and who will have little sympathy for this whinge londoner however fourteen year of failure from the previous government have leave public transport in every part of our country fail to keep pace with the need of the people who rely on it on their watch cancel train journey rise to record high passenger have have to navigate million different type of ticket option and bus be drive million few mile per year compare with for our corner of south london the previous government mismanagement lead to cancel scheme fail project and accessibility for passenger be ignore croydon be london most populated borough with project population growth of by in my constituency last year east croydon station have over million journey pass through its gate make it the most use station in great britain for my constituent use east croydon station mean deal with congestion antisocial behaviour and fail footbridge project that be now know locally as the bridge to nowhere the project originally design to improve accessibility to the station have be beset by delay and cause endless frustration for resident after decade of inaction and local taxpayer money go into the project network rail have now downgrade its plan and remove direct access to platform which have cause more frustration for passenger and more congestion at the station add insult to injury for my community under the previous government the croydon area remodelle scheme scheme design to address congestion on the brighton main line and upgrade croydon train station be shelve as that scheme be no long go ahead norwood junction station in my constituency which be the busy station in britain will not get the investment that it desperately need no improvement to platform no improvement to service and no improvement to accessibility and the addition of new lift have be deem too complicated by network rail without the scheme wide improvement welcome the government commitment to improve public transport across every part of our country to put passenger first and to work with our regional mayor not against they not only do that mean more region of our country will benefit from public control of bus network and from train service with few delay but for my constituency it mean labour government work with labour mayor to finally give we the tram that we so desperately need yes be fortunate to be londoner who have have access to all the public transport that could possibly need but with government who invest in every region we can do so much more we come to the final back bench speech thank the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke for secure the debate be grateful in particular to my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer who show the depth of her knowledge and understanding of this important matter have an observation about the opposition benches however madam deputy speaker it appear that you wait all day for tory mp to turn up to debate on public transport and none do indicate dissent with the exception of course of the shadow minister who be oblige to be here be also grateful that the scope of the debate be widen beyond the west country as represent the second easternmost constituency in the country the far eastern corner of the isle of thanet hundred of year ago up to tudor time we be cut off from the rest of the country by the river wantsum fear that the legacy of the conservative party be that they try their good to effectively reinstate our island status by gutte our public transport and cut we off from the rest of the country fortunately however when it come to train there be labour government legacy thank in particular to the support and involvement of my labour predecessor stephen ladyman former mp for south thanet and transport minister and of course of the late great john prescott they make enormous progress on connectivity and public transport salvage the high speed rail project from which my constituency benefit so much as it link we to london and the rest of the uk with all the economic benefit that follow and other include my constituent and colleague from across kent strongly advocate for the return of international service to ashford on the high speed rail line because of all the economic benefit that would deliver it be already on the record that kent see massive reduction in bus service under the previous government with few bus mile than under the previous labour government the government announcement on bus funding be extremely welcome especially as kent have receive the high proportion of funding in the whole of the south east at million that funding combine with the new power for local authority mean that tory run kent county council have the ability to reverse the cut in bus mile and implore it to use the power and money to do so there may be member on the other side of the chamber it be difficult to see any who be entirely unfamiliar with bus timetable as they all stick to their car however in broadstairs where huge swathe of the town have no access to bus service at all an old person would be leave to walk cycle or much more likely rely on lift from friend family or taxi the sheer expense of rely on taxi as primary mode of transport be enormous unsustainable and fundamentally unfair this have create situation where if someone become ill and be in need of nhs service they be force to pay for taxi when they may not be able to afford one or as often happen simply go without medical treatment this be particularly challenging as lot of nhs service in east thanet have be move inland that be an all too common issue in coastal community such as mine for example in east kent our orthopaedic centre be locate in canterbury there be now no direct bus from broadstairs or ramsgate to canterbury so people with mobility issue face barrier to treatment for some make that extend journey mean take time off work that have ramification for our economy as people who need treatment have to take time off work when they otherwise would not that often force people to simply go without treatment in the early stage of their illness which can only make they sicker and place more cost on the nhs far down the line not only be this damaging to the sick people themselves it stunt the economy and put excess strain on public service this be not the only way in which lack of public transport option hurt our economy it also impact the regeneration of our local high street have many constituent who would much prefer to do their shopping in person on our local high street contribute to our local economy but who now feel that they have no option but to switch to online shopping because of the lack of transport option since they do not drive let tell you madam deputy speaker that when have suggest it might be possible to have bus connect ramsgate train station to ramsgate high street you would have think from some people face that be ask to bend the law of physics we have be so used to the idea that this be simply impossible reliable affordable accessible and safe transport be matter of social and economic justice applaud all the action that the government be take to regenerate our high street which be major issue in east thanet that the ramsgate empty shop campaign be seek to work with the government on but if people can not get to those high street fear we will not make the progress that we rightly want although we have significant new secretary of state with responsibility for this area we also need to think about the legacy of previous secretaries of state in particular barbara castle when she be first appoint by harold wilson she turn around to the prime minister and say you do know harold that can drive in the late this be see as hamper her ability to be suitable transport secretary but in his wisdom harold wilson say yes barbara exactly that be the point think of the change that she be able to make not only to public transport but to road safety give we strong legacy that have last all my lifetime and hope much far beyond good public transport be fundamental to achieve the government mission in the same way that it be fundamental to we be able to live our own life and achieve our own ambition simply to get up go to work access the service we need get home safely and see the people we love call the liberal democrat spokesperson commend the hon member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer on her excellent maiden speech and congratulate she on have the old road in her constituency and doubtless the old pothole as well also commend my hon friend the members for horsham john milne for guildford zöe franklin for thornbury and yate claire young and for taunton and wellington gideon amos and the hon member for swindon north will stone for stroud dr opher for leeds south west and morley mr sewards for edinburgh south west dr arthur for rossendale and darwen andy macnae and for east thanet ms billington who speak with one voice on the dire state of public transport in many of our rural area agree with my friend the hon member for croydon east natasha irons before become transport spokesman do not realise how lucky we be in london although our constituent have legitimate complaint at time we do not know how lucky we be also thank my hon friend the member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke and echo her question to the minister regard the disruption to commuter from the south west cause by the work on old oak common what can be do to minimise that disruption as we have hear from colleague across the house the current state of public transport simply be not good enough ticket price be too high service be too unreliable infrastructure be too old and capacity be too meagre and that be just for those who have access to public transport too many part of our country have no meaningful access to public transport whatsoever after year of route be cut and timetable be foreshorten many people no long have access to regular bus service despite live many mile distant from any rail network this be hamper our economy hold back local community and damage our high street our public transport system should be the engine of growth and opportunity not an impediment to they if we be to reach the government target on economic growth and net zero we must take rapid and urgent step to improve our public transport provision we simply do not have time to tarry let be clear my party and have huge sympathy for the minister the secretary of state and the government everyone know they inherit mess from the previous regime chaos and miss opportunity year of under investment chop change and rudderless leadership have leave our public transport in turmoil and appreciate and publicly acknowledge the new government worthy intention and evident desire to improve the situation my party consequently welcome the government commitment to long overdue rail reform be glad to see the first green shoot of positive change ensure reach euston in the first phase of the project be critical to achieve tangible benefit from what be in danger of become an expensive folly while recent talk of an integrate national transport strategy show that this government appreciate that something need to change we welcome the recent announcement on bus too as we have hear today from so many colleague they be critical to many area we know you get it as hon friend so eloquently argue despite bus be the most utilise form of public transport in the country they be regularly not give the attention or funding they deserve so thank you for that so far so good then however there be always the department for transport be onside be not so sure that the chancellor be with her real term cut to the department day to day and capital budget if she be serious about grow the economy she need to be serious about properly fund the transport system on which it be build rather than cut budget and make up the shortfall by hike bus fare by up to and an above inflation increase in the cost of travel by train the hon gentleman be not in his place at the time and indeed neither be but it be worthwhile look at the verdict of another transport nerd journalist from the transport times back in who look at exactly what happen when the liberal democrats do have an opportunity to do something about rural bus in county after county cut in rural bus service support have be severe city deal may have be welcome but the idea that local government might be trust to raise its own funding and decide on priority have slip far into the mist of history just think it be worth remind the house of that fact we be talk about now and we be talk about the fact that you have reduce the bus fare cap order just quick reminder that when be on my foot member should not be that be third time the hon gentleman have say you perhaps he will be bit more careful in the rest of his speech apology madam deputy speaker we be talk about now and we be talk about the hike in the bus fare cap to it would cost only million to keep it at accord to the house of commons library thank the minister for write to this week to confirm that full monitoring and evaluation report have be complete by his department and will be publish in due course but why be it not be publish now if it be there we want to see it what do it say do not doubt the battle the minister and his colleague be have with their colleague in the treasury know the department for transport recognise there be fundamental problem across our public transport system however there be still vanishingly little detail on which to form judgment as to whether it have hit on the right solution on the railway for example yesterday come the long await announcement of the first three train operate company to be bring back into public ownership south western railway which use in my journey this morning will come into public ownership next may that much be know however what be not know be how that in itself will improve the customer experience and the service offer as great british railways will still not formally exist by then south western railway will at least temporarily be leave in the hand of the government operator of last resort which surely need more than name change as it assume responsibility for million of extra journey without clear mission or purpose without the necessary resource or expertise without an effective passenger watchdog and without meaningful reform of our break fare system even when great british railways arrive at the station we still have no understanding of how or even if this new behemoth will proceed smoothly along the track uncertainty also shroud many other public transport plan too many local authority be wait to know what fund and scheme will be maintain and what will be scrap stifle investment and leave too many area and community adrift as we can see with the lack of certainty over the northern powerhouse the electrification of north wales rail level up and active travel that be why we welcome talk of an integrate national transport plan as it be clear that the current piecemeal approach be let down community and local economy but the devil will be in the detail which we need to see soon rather than later uncertainty likewise surround the government approach to rebuild our decaying infrastructure to improve our public transport we need to get spade into the ground invest money and effort into electrification and most importantly build new infrastructure while there be widespread public disquiet regard our current public transport provision there be also deep scepticism about and often outright opposition to the major infrastructure project necessary to achieve real improvement repeat cost overspend and miss deadline have contribute to an environment in which the public be rightly sceptical about the uk ability to deliver infrastructure on time and within budget we need to get real while bruce wayne might be rich enough to spend million on bat shed the british taxpayer be not the uk do not have the time or resource require to put every rail line in tunnel politician across the political spectrum need to promote more mature dialogue to improve public understanding of the trade off necessary to improve public transport as we have see with other large scale infrastructure project once they be build the public reception be overwhelmingly positive as it be with crossrail the benefit of the elizabeth line be already be laud from read to romford with protest long forget host of neighbouring mp call for its extension to their constituency in recent westminster hall debate that attend so let we be honest about what need to be do and what the government have learn from these project let we maintain steady pipeline of new project to ensure that the billion spend acquire that knowledge along with the supply chain and skilled workforce we have build up be not lose too much time have be waste and we do not have time to waste public transport be vital to our economy to widen opportunity and our transition to net zero as londoner realise that be bless by the public transport system that we have in the capital despite sometimes justify criticism of transport for london it stand as an exemplar of what can be achieve via co ordinate transport strategy and non ideological approach to ownership work with both public and private provider to create an integrated transport network as we hear from colleague across the house the situation be very different across much of the country hope that the secretary of state and the chancellor be both listen call the shadow secretary of state congratulate the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke on successfully apply for the debate and thank the backbench business committee for grant it public transport be an indispensable part of our national life play vital role in our commercial social and economic existence we have have an interesting debate this afternoon with noteworthy contribution from the hon member for glastonbury and somerton for horsham john milne for guildford zöe franklin for thornbury and yate claire young and for taunton and wellington gideon amos as well as just now from the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler from the liberal democrats from the government benches the first speech be the maiden speech of the hon member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer it be thoughtful speech about bus use be sure that she will serve her constituent diligently in her time in this place and wish she well she be follow by some capable contribution from the hon member for swindon north will stone for stroud dr opher for leeds south west and morley mr sewards for edinburgh south west dr arthur for rossendale and darwen andy macnae for croydon east natasha irons and for east thanet ms billington will begin by comment on the previous conservative government time in office it may have escape the attention of hon member that between and the conservative government spend more than billion operate and enhance our railway this allow the completion of major project include crossrail thameslink and major upgrade to the east coast main line the great anglia main line the midland main line and the great western main line we commit billion to the network north programme which unless the labour government stop it will deliver long term transformative transport project that will benefit great many people in the north of england the programme be under review by the government with no guarantee that any of it will be take forward obviously we call on the government to honour the programme in full we electrify over mile of track compare with the mere mile electrify in the year of the previous labour government some of rail journey be now take on electrify track we seek scheme that would reconnect community to our railway provide new station for passenger to use such as the propose new station at edginswell in torbay which would complement the delivery of new station at marsh barton near exeter and would particularly serve the need of torbay hospital know that torbay council be keen advocate for that and hope that the labour government will offer the same commitment to it that we do to support our bus network we invest an unprecedented amount of over billion in the bus sector from march to support its recovery from the pandemic we provide million of funding to deliver new british build electric or hydrogen bus and we extend the get around for scheme until the end of cap hundred of single bus fare and help passenger reliant on bus with the cost of travel scheme that we pledge to maintain for the entirety of this parliament also remind the house of some fact that be curiously miss from the speech of some hon member particularly those sit on the government benches let we turn our gaze to wales where labour have be in power for quarter of century the number of journey take on local bus have decline by almost quarter in the past decade with severe impact on those in the most rural area the welsh labour administration have spend million on roll out mph speed limit to try to force motorist on to public transport that the labour administration themselves have make less reliable less regular and less affordable let we look at london which have be blight by the leadership of sadiq khan for the past eight and half year london mayor recently spend million of public money on yet more virtue signalling rename london overground line something that be sure commuter thank he for last week when the elizabeth line be suspend and five underground line face severe delay from man who promise to roll up his sleeve and ensure no more transport strike we have see more than day of strike during his term of office we know what the labour party promise the voter of this country in its manifesto it pledge new infrastructure an overhaul of britain railway and certainty for car manufacturer it promise utopian system of public transport but the method by which the government have set out to achieve that have be depressingly predictable one of the labour government first act be to provide train driver with inflation bust pay rise without secure any productivity improvement for passenger at all that bribe to the union have entirely predictably fail to prevent repeat threat of further strike action then as part of the welsh government ongoing war against rural community they cut billion worth of road improvement scheme the government then increase the previous conservative government bus fare cap to increase fare on hundred of bus route across the country interruption totally predictably get heckled about it not be pay for as hon member will be aware once they have be in this place for little long government scheme be fund for particular period of time and then the funding be review the new bus far cap cost bus user more than the previous cap be guarantee only until the end of next year whereas the conservative party manifesto commitment be to retain the cap at for the whole of the parliament finally and perhaps most notably the government have introduce and pass the passenger railway services public ownership act instead of implement the measured and sensible reform set out in the williams shapps review the government have pass an act that will neither improve passenger experience nor make significant saving indeed it may prove to cost the taxpayer significantly more the government insist that saving to the taxpayer will amount to million because of the removal of fee pay to train operating company even if that be correct it will amount to saving of mere of what be currently spend on the railway and even that tiny figure be in doubt analysis conduct by rail partner suggest that remove the incentive to control cost could lead to annual subsidy be at least billion high by the end of this parliament from whatever angle one look at it it be hard to see this act as anything other than an ideological move one that have more to do with attempt to appease the radical element of the labour party hungry for old fashioned hard left policy than the good of the passenger and the taxpayer just want to give the hon gentleman the opportunity to confirm that the tory government be perfectly comfortable with public ownership of train operating company as long as they belong to government of other country in europe the previous government be prepared to do what work rather than follow ideology in spite of evidence to the contrary have be the shadow transport secretary for day and be already on my second secretary of state have know the new secretary of state for almost two decade since our time as councillor represent our respective london borough on the london councils transport and environment committee she be not in her place today secretary of state can not be everywhere that be why they have junior ministers be sure that the under secretary of state for transport the hon member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood will ably deputise for she this afternoon cross path with the new secretary of state when be conservative leader on the london assembly and she be appoint the deputy mayor for transport unfortunately during her time at city hall london witness strike on transport for london service increase in complaint about tfl over three year an extension of the hat ultra low emission zone and perhaps most concerning of all billion overspend and three year delay in the opening of the elizabeth line in defence of the right hon lady though the buck for all those failing do not stop with she it stop with the mayor of london the right hon lady be in fact somebody for whom have high personal regard and look forward to welcome she to her place it be fair to say that the conservatives have doubt about the start make by this government however have say all that emphasise that his majesty opposition will not oppose the government just for the sake of it do not believe that single member of this house want public transport system that fail as say at the outset public transport be an indispensable part of our national life and successful transport system be vital to both our present and our future if the government get thing right we will acknowledge that where they get they wrong we will continue to hold they to account call the minister thank the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke for secure this important debate on improve public transport believe we have reach our destination madam deputy speaker have hear the last of the labour maiden speech and of course we have save one of the good for last congratulate my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer on her fantastic contribution and very much look forward to work with she in her capacity as member of the transport committee also thank the other hon member who have speak for their insightful point be pleased to respond for the government and will do my good to address the issue that they have raise start my response by emphasise that this government be put the need of passenger front and centre of our transport reform we fully recognise the importance of public transport to our community in rural area town and city deliver well it enable people to access work and education opportunity and to access the shop leisure activity and essential service that they need it can sustain and improve economic growth and productivity unlock housing and commercial development opportunity and connect people to each other to business and market and to international gateway however there be lot of work to be do to improve our public transport many people and place suffer from poor connectivity and challenging journey which impact both their quality of life and their access to opportunity that be why the government be focus on improve performance on the railway and drive forward rail reform improve bus service and grow bus usage across the country transform infrastructure so that it work for the whole country promote social mobility and tackle regional inequality we have be make progress last week the government set out their plan to develop an integrate national transport strategy which will set out how all mode of transport should be design build and operate to well serve all the people who use they and enable they to live fulfilling life to kick start that process on november the department launch public call for idea seek to capture people view and experience of transport across england and what could be do to improve it deliver an effective efficient and integrated public transport system that meet the regional and national need of people wherever they live and work will play vital role in deliver the mission of this government my hon friend be talk about the regional and national economic growth strategy urge he and his friend in the department to consider whether we need strategy for public transport in our coastal community they suffer from poor connectivity which reduce our ability to grow our economy all year round have grow up in coastal community understand that they have unique challenge will of course take that point away to the department the important work to improve service have already begin we start reform transport on day one after the general election take bus the most commonly use mode of public transport in britain the government have ambitious plan to improve service and grow passenger number we know how important bus service be to community up and down the country particularly in rural area where for many bus can be lifeline and the only way of get around and access vital service bus cut be absolutely devastating for the woman speak to who could not get her weekly shop the young man meet who have to leave for work hour early to try to get multiple bus and the husband who could not get bus to the care home his wife be in since the east midland have suffer bus cut of than any other region do the minister agree that regional inequality be at the heart of this debate and that it be far past time that we see investment in our bus absolutely of course we need to ensure that we have effective efficient and affordable public transport in every single corner of the country in september we take the first step in empower local leader by introduce statutory instrument to expand franchising power beyond mayoral combine authority to all local transport authority we also consult on new guidance for local leader look to bring service into public control this new simplified guidance will help to break down barrier to local control of bus service speed up the process and bring down cost of course the bus bill will empower local leader by give they the tool that they need to address local public transport challenge include by make further change to simplify bus franchising and by create locally own bus company we have already see example of the improvement that local leader can make to service to take my favourite example the bee network in manchester be on course to complete the re regulation of bus in its new network in the new year it will become the first city region outside london to put bus fully back under public control after four decade of deregulation this new bus network franchise have see increase in both patronage and punctuality we be back up those reform with new funding for bus next year in the budget the government confirm that there would be more than billion to help local transport authority and operator to deliver high quality reliable public service that include million to deliver the new fare cap which will ensure that passenger have access to affordable fare and well opportunity million for local authority to continue to support and improve their bus service and million for the bus service operator grant that be give directly to bus operator to support and protect exist service that funding be the next stop on our journey towards improve service every region in england will benefit the money will make real difference for people across the country and could be use to fund more frequent service so that people can get to more place more often safe well and more accessible bus stop new electric bus or well real time information so that passenger can be confident that their bus will turn up of course it be not just bus passenger who want their service to run on time on railway we have be clear that service have be fail passenger performance be inconsistent across the country and in many area the service be not where it need to be improve performance be key priority and we will continue to challenge the worst perform train operating company and their network rail counterpart to address poor performance and raise standard just as with bus we have be make progress we have resolve long run industrial dispute over pay end the massive disruption and financial impact of national strike and reset industrial relation that pave the way for more collaboration with the trade union and the delivery of railway that work for everyone as well as continue to fund the operation of the railway we be commit to invest to deliver improvement for passenger we be simplify and modernise the rail fare and ticket system and have already make great progress we have drive forward pay as you go in the south east through the delivery of project oval phase in we will see further phase of project oval go live which will include stansted we have also have complete detailed design of pay as you go scheme in the west midland and greater manchester plan to launch digital pay as you go trial in we continue to progress

alaa have be deny the right to be with his young son who live and attend school in brighton welcome member of his family who be in the gallery today alaa current detention should have end on september when his most recent five year sentence end his appalling imprisonment be for the crime of spread false news because he share facebook post detail act of torture against another inmate the date of his sentence end but the egyptian government refuse to release he argue that his two year spend languish in pre trial detention do not count towards his sentence that be in complete violation of international legal norm as well as egypt own domestic law let briefly offer list of who have call for alaa release because the scale of support for he internationally be extraordinary our last four uk prime ministers have demand his release also on the list be the president of france the chancellor of germany the white house the editorial board of some of the most significant newspaper from across the globe include the guardian and the washington post the un high commissioner for human rights and nobel laureate for literature and that be just few my right hon friend rightly list figure

we about the case commend the right hon gentleman for bring this forward have speak to he in today debate which hope the right hon member watch on tv he would have see the minister come forward with some idea on how to take this matter forward it have be mention that alaa abd el fattah be british citizen carry british passport have to mean more than just be british citizen it give we right where be those right do the right hon member agree that his continued detention should raise red flag with the foreign commonwealth and development office far do he not believe that this deserve great push for alaa abd el fattah release hope that the minister reply will outline some of the thing that believe the government will do in positive fashion will come on to some of those issue later in my speech but this be running theme in the debate that take place early as well to follow on from what my hon friend the member for leeds east richard burgon say with regard to alaa case and the show of support last year more than parliaments echo the call for his release in letter to the then foreign secretary in this new parliament alaa have find support across the benches today debate on the protection of british national arbitrarily detain abroad have demonstrate the breadth of that support we also have new all party parliamentary group take up the case follow the decision by the egyptian authority to effectively ignore the end of alaa sentence his mother laila soueif professor of mathematic at cairo university whom number of hon member have meet resort to the only method that she think she have leave hunger strike today be the day of that hunger strike since september she have consume no calorie survive solely on salt black coffee and herbal tea she have lose of her body weight and as anyone who have experience of hunger strike know unfortunately in this country we have know they in the past she be now enter an extremely urgent and dangerous phase laila who be bear in london feel compel to take this extreme action because she believe that she be not be listen to by either of her government both in egypt and unfortunately in the uk alaa have be repeatedly target by the egyptian government he be first arrest in for protest for the independence of the judiciary in october he be arrest after write newspaper article detail the egyptian military killing of mostly egyptian christian protester know in egypt as the maspero massacre the original demonstration be against the demolition of church in alaa be arrest again falsely accuse of organise protest in

newspaper mada masr while sleep in the police station he be visit in the middle of the night by security agent who threaten he and tell he to stop write he courageously refuse to do so among the many thing that he write and share be story on facebook about man who have die in prison allegedly after be torture after six month alaa be re arrest in september he be arrest while inside the police station where he be require to sleep and take to an undisclosed state security facility his lawyer mohamed el baqer find he and be himself arrest while represent alaa the lawyer be now serve four year in prison alaa be hold in inhumane condition at tora prison in cell with no sunlight he be deny access to book exercise radio mattress or bedding or any time out of his cell he be not even allow clock to be aware of the time of the day so day would pass without he realise bad of all he be place under the custody of the very same officer who be accuse of torture man to death alaa be hold in this nightmare of place for two year at that time he tell his family that he be have suicidal thought which be understandable then in december his application for his british passport his right under the british nationality act come through one time use emergency passport be hand to his family who then go to the prison they be not allow to take even letter to alaa and the family insist that blank postcard of the queen be deliver to he the prison guard perhaps confused take the postcard and give it to alaa for month thereafter that postcard of the queen be the only thing in his cell this be how his family finally let he know that he have become british citizen alaa and his family think that thing would now change but week pass and no consular official arrive request by the british embassy for consular access to their citizen be deny desperate in april alaa declare himself on hunger strike until the egyptian authority would allow the british consular service to access he that fail to this day he have still never receive consular visit many of we will remember the scene in the run up to and during which be hold in egypt with still no movement after month on gandhi style strike of calorie day alaa escalate to full water strike there be scene of global solidarity with alaa from those in the climate movement nobel laureate and world leader include chancellor olaf scholz and president emmanuel macron our former prime minister rishi sunak write to alaa family before travel to order the right hon gentleman just refer to the right hon member for richmond and northallerton by name he really should know well than to do that you get on that one madam deputy speaker hand up will hand myself in later our former prime minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak write to alaa family before travel to egypt he say that the government be deeply committed to do everything we can to resolve alaa case as soon as possible despite that commitment two year on from cop alaa family have nothing to show for the uk government effort to secure his release if this new arbitrary extension of alaa sentence be allow to pass without intervention from the british authority his family fear as many of we do that he will never be release they have cause to believe that as the egyptian government have repeatedly engage in practice they call case recycling which be when new case be bring against prisoner approach the end of their sentence accord to human right organisation such as the cairo institute for human rights studies in at least defendant be rotate to new case in another defendant be treat in the same way alaa family begin to lose faith in the previous government with ministers seemingly unwilling to take any action on his case beyond simply raise it with their egyptian counterpart while that be go on we witness the government seek ever close economic tie with the egyptian government the election of labour government give alaa family renew sense of hope the foreign secretary have be supporter of the campaign he be alongside alaa sister during their sit in outside the foreign office and publicly describe alaa as courageous voice for democracy in egypt as shadow foreign secretary he outline series of practical suggestion for get alaa back to the uk which include leverage our substantive trade relation with egypt restrict the access of the egyptian ambassador and pause new strategic partnership with the egyptian government until alaa case be resolve the only relevant detail that have change since the foreign secretary make those remark as shadow foreign secretary be that alaa sentence have now end but he remain in prison like the hon member for strangford jim shannon call upon the foreign secretary to stay true to his word and to see through some of the action that he outline in he know then as be evident that strategy base solely on raise the case in meeting will not secure alaa release ahead of september when alaa be suppose to be release multiple member of this house write to the foreign secretary alert he to the end of alaa sentence and ask he to ensure that appropriate action be take just day before the the foreign secretary be picture smile with his egyptian counterpart on november our prime minister be photograph shake hand with president sisi on november table question on whether the prime minister have raise alaa case with the president on that occasion have not yet receive response to be brutally frank it be not clear that any serious step have be take to alert the egyptian government to the fact that britain be expect alaa to be release on that date it be still unclear whether the government have change their approach to the case since the date pass motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now smith we expect significant change of approach from the last government because the previous method fail so would welcome an update from the minister to the house on whether their approach have change there be series of step the government could take that would see alaa reunite with his family and especially with his son the minister should change the travel advice for egypt on the foreign office website to reflect the reality of the moment that if person be arrest in egypt the government can not guarantee even consular access the united states provide that advice to its citizen why do we not last year see record number of british holidaymaker go to egypt country where tourism be significant part of the economy change the travel advice to reflect the reality of the situation would demonstrate to the egyptians that our government be take alaa detention seriously we know the egyptian government be seek an increase in british investment into egypt we should be clear and announce moratorium on any new trade agreement with egypt until alaa be free last month non governmental organisation include the committee to protect journalists fairsquare and the global magnitsky justice campaign ask the british government to put on hold any new government assistance or promotion of new foreign direct investment into egypt until alaa be free in recent day we have also see new research from the campaign against arms trade expose the fact that britain have sell more than million of arm licence to egypt while alaa remain in prison that include the large ever single arm licence on record from britain to egypt worth nearly million for military radar in december that be further evidence of the depth of the relationship between the uk and egypt that can and should be leveraged it go without say that no such deal of that kind must be pursue by the new government while british citizen be imprison as the foreign secretary previously suggest there should be diplomatic consequence for the egyptian ambassador how be it right that he continue to be allow access to the high level of our government while refuse to allow british official in cairo to do their job under the vienna convention on consular relation write to the egyptian ambassador hope he receive my email in the hope that we would receive some positive message from he before the debate and we could break the good news that the egyptian government have decide to release alaa have receive no response whatsoever have outline some of the measure that the government could take to make it clear to egypt that the refusal to recognise alaa british nationality and the failure to recognise and respect its own law on time serve will have serious consequence for the bilateral relationship hope the government will grasp the urgency and seriousness of the situation especially in the context of year old woman on hunger strike whose life be at risk and take the action necessary to see alaa release hopefully in time to spend christmas with his son in brighton would like to end by send message from this house to alaa echo his own word back to he from the title of his book you have not yet be defeat say to alaa you have not be and we will not let you be defeat we will secure your release acknowledge alaa family who be in the public gallery be grateful to my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell for secure this debate and pay tribute to he for his tireless support for mr el fattah and his family be also grateful to all right hon and hon member for their contribution in this and the early debate re emphasise both to alaa family and to the house that his release remain priority for the uk government recognise the profound impact that his imprisonment have have on he and his family the government and as the minister responsible be do all we can to find resolution our priority remain to reunite he with his family and until that happen we be work to ensure that he be allow consular access and support as say early support british national overseas be at the heart of our work at the foreign office that include dual national and more recent british national such as alaa have meet mr el fattah family on number of occasion include his incredibly impressive mother laila who be in the chamber last week and whom also see in cairo share my the concern of my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington about she wellbeing as she be deep into hunger strike as he rightly say the health implication of that be obviously serious be sure that the whole house share the government concern about her welfare we will continue to be in regular contact with mr el fattah family to discuss his case the foreign secretary recently meet the family include laila last week meet she last month during my visit to cairo and when she be in the house more recently our consular official and our ambassador in cairo work around the clock on this case at the same time we know from listen to the family that they feel that more support be require that feeling be share in other case and as say to the house early that be why we be look to strengthen our approach through the appointment of special envoy to work with family on the most complex detention case of which mr el fattah case be clearly one let turn to the question of mr el fattah nationality which be contest the uk have consistently and unambiguously maintain that he be british national and that remain the position of the new labour government he become british citizen in december while he be in detention but shortly before be sentence stress that the timing of his citizenship in the same month as his sentencing be in no way connect to the uk government position on his case as the foreign secretary say in the house last week there be no conspiracy behind this we have always be clear with egypt that mr el fattah be grant nationality in the normal way he be british national and be therefore entitle to consular access under the vienna convention we disagree with the egyptian view that he be an egyptian mono national and that the process for confer nationality be in any way irregular we continue to urge the egyptians to grant we consular access under the vienna convention on consular relation as they have do in other case of detain dual national in response to my right hon friend comment let say little about how we have be engage with egypt across all our engagement we have be clear that this case will be resolve only by mr el fattah release that be the message that deliver when see foreign minister abdelatty and the egyptian ambassador on what be the first visit by minister of the new government to egypt the foreign secretary have also raise this case directly with the foreign minister as have the minister for development my right hon friend the member for oxford east anneliese dodds just this week can also confirm to my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington that the prime minister do discuss the case with president sisi in august would like to reassure alaa family and this house that we will continue to press the egyptians until mr el fattah be free and reunite with his family be aware of course of the understandable frustration that member feel at alaa situation and the desire that the uk government roll back our relationship with egypt or drop all economic support however our partnership with egypt be crucial to alleviate suffering in the region and for our push for wide peace and security in the region while be in egypt announce further assistance for the egyptian healthcare system in order to support palestinians who have cross from gaza and be in need of urgent medical care also sign memorandum of understanding aim at boost the egyptians effort on food security know that my right hon friend and many other member of the house be aware of the catastrophic humanitarian situation in gaza the humanitarian crisis in sudan and the many pressure on egypt where poverty be also very high as such while mr el fattah remain at the forefront of my mind the foreign secretary mind and the mind of the whole government we will continue to try to ensure that our relationship with egypt be positive and productive where those effort be necessary to protect other british national and try to deal with question of international peace and security want to make it explicit that nobody who have raise this case want to prevent the uk government from provide aid and assistance particularly give the issue that be happen to the palestinians in gaza we be certainly not ask for that what we be ask for relate to the relationship on trade and on arm sale believe there be potential leverage in those area to enable we to secure alaa release in addition the relationship with the egyptian ambassador also give we the opportunity to exercise some leverage those be the activity that we would like the government to pursue will come back to those point in little while if may at the heart of our general approach be the firm belief that through continue engagement we can encourage the egyptians to improve their human right record and that strong relationship than the one we inherit would allow we to have frank and open discussion with key decision maker as my colleague and have recently do so that we can see improvement both in alaa case and in relation to the wide human right and social situation in egypt reassure my right hon friend that in my engagement with both the egyptian ambassador and egyptian ministers we be clear at all time about the importance of this case include its importance to the very many international observer whom my right hon friend run through so articulately this case be important to egypt international reputation and it will of course shape the view of investor and other when they think about their engagement in conclusion the uk remain firmly committed to secure mr el fattah release and reunite he with his family we will continue to push egypt towards resolution make clear that the only way to resolve this case be by release he the minister be come to conclusion can we have an assurance that we will receive report to the house in the come month about the effectiveness of the action the government have take in secure alaa release have be press on this case twice in day be more than happy to commit to return to the house within month to give further update we will continue to push egypt for resolution and thank my right hon friend for his interest in the case and many other in this house for their interest have no doubt that will be regularly come to the house to update member on our effort in relation to mr el fattah and know that the whole house be think of his mother and the rest of his family during this incredibly difficult time question put and agree to house adjourn
