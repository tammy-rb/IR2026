commend this statement to the house be grateful to the minister for advance sight of his statement this be the first statement on syria offer by the government this year and frankly it could not have come soon enough it be deeply alarming that in recent day we have be witness to some of the deadly violence in syria since the beginning of this dreadful conflict the opposition have be raise question write and oral about the government approach to syria throughout the year so it be with some disappointment that we have have to wait this long and to be quite frank for these event for minister to give an update report that hundred of civilian have be kill in clash include alawite civilian be troubling the syrian people have suffer year of conflict and decade of oppression the country be now at fork in the road but these terrible event be stark reminder that well future for the people of syria for all group and all minority be far from guaranteed we should be clear that those who have ratchet up the appalling situation in recent day should pull back from the brink not jeopardise that well future the labour government have decide to establish contact with hayat tahrir al sham and the interim administration in syria so can the minister confirm whether the foreign office have raise this escalation in violence with interlocutor and if so whether the government have clearly convey set of expectation for how the temperature should be take down and stability restore can he also confirm whether there have be any direct engagement between ministers and hts leader at any point and what be his assessment of hts response to this violence and the threat pose by remnant of the disgraceful assad regime we note that the government have announce they be lift sanction on entity link to the depose assad regime do the violence of recent day change the government assessment of the merit of lift such sanction before the minister lift those particular sanction do he consult us and european ally as well as partner in the region be the sanction lift at the request of hts and be there plan to lift further sanction can the minister also be clear with the house about precisely what condition criterion and evidence be be use to drive these decision on the minister visit to turkey last week he say the uk be commit to work in partnership with turkey to support syria transition to an inclusive and peaceful country but what exactly do that mean in practice and what do he see as turkey role on security issue specifically can he confirm that there remain no change to the conservative government very firm position on foreign fighter that they must not come back to the uk what be his assessment of the syrian state ability to counter any isis cell in the east of the country and have he see any progress on secure border in the region and the prevention of smuggle people drug and weapon the government be right that assad chemical weapon stockpile need to be secure and destroy and that need to be verify by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons however be the minister confident these weapon will indeed be destroy we acknowledge that the government have put more funding into the opcw syria mission follow the fall of assad regime but we still need syria to meet its obligation under the chemical weapon convention in full we need concrete action as well as word turn to the humanitarian situation where do the minister judge the need be most acute and how be he mobilise uk aid to ensure that it be safely distribute and be genuinely reach those innocent civilian in need with the reduction of official development assistance to can the minister confirm that syria will continue to be priority and that fund will be make available give the security and strategic issue finally on the transition to representative and inclusive governance we note the launching of the non bind national dialogue conference by the interim government of syria but do the minister believe that this process will yield the kind of result we all want for the people of syria and have he discuss this through the channel he have establish with the interim government will try to answer as many of the shadow foreign secretary question as can as she know we have have senior level contact with the new hts leadership our foreign secretary meet the interim foreign minister on the margin of the paris meeting we have not yet send ministers to damascus as many of our partner will we keep these issue under close review on whether we be consult the europeans on sanction and other thing the europeans have take step on sanction slightly in advance of we can not remember the precise date but they relax their sanction before we do can confirm to the shadow foreign secretary that we keep all decision on sanction under very close review the entity for which sanction be lift on friday be very much focused on the economic function of syria as the shadow foreign secretary know well syria be in the midst of very significant economic crisis the syrian pound have lose of its value and we want to protect the syrian people from the consequence of that crisis the relaxation of sanction be very much focused on allow normal syrians and humanitarian actor to get on with their life but we will keep all further sanction under close review the shadow foreign secretary ask about hts progress on border and counter terrorism and drug she be exactly right to say that we must judge hts on its action not its word hts have make some very welcome commitment on range of question for example we have see welcome commitment from the new interim authority to work with the opcw the interim foreign minister have engage with the opcw which have now visit damascus that be to be welcome but the shadow foreign secretary be right that action not word will be how we judge our syria policy call the chair of the foreign affairs committee thank the minister for his statement and echo his horror at the killing of civilian in syria this weekend agree that this be critical and fragile moment for the country in letter to last week the foreign secretary make it clear that the government policy be to push for an inclusive political process and accountability in syria this be of course exactly what be need to deal with the tension form by decade of civil war and brutal dictatorship but what be the government actually do to make sure this happen we hear about aid and the loosening of sanction be this the full extent of their plan if there be more can it be implement properly when we do not have an embassy in syria and when our special representative have visit damascus only twice this year my right hon friend raise some important point include about what the transitional government will look like and the answer be that all of syria diverse community need to feel that they have presence in the new government of syria of course

reassure those community that they be welcome in the new syria as the shadow foreign secretary note discuss this with my turkish counterpart last week can confirm that we have deliver these message clearly and consistently to the interim authority that we have raise the most recent violence with they and that we be seek urgent clarification on the confusing event at the coast which as my right

understand whether the violence represent spontaneous clash between different sect or be the product of state direct policy this must inform the government position on whether to lift sanction to support syria development and reintegration into the global community note that the interim syrian government have announce the establishment of an independent committee to investigate the violent clash but this must be follow up with concrete step to protect syrians of all ethnic and religious group and ensure they be represent in the new administration as well as action to bring justice to

syria over the weekend do my hon friend agree that the time for warm word from the syrian government on protect minority have pass and that action to safeguard religious minority such as alawites and christians be require if so what more can the united kingdom do to prompt those action my hon friend be right that action not word must be the yardstick by which we judge the interim authority include the interim president follow the violence they have make some important commitment about hold the perpetrator to justice be clear that this be not state order we need now to see the consequence of those word in those coastal community in syria we will be watch very carefully the foreign secretary write to the foreign affairs committee last week about the importance of ensure accountability for crime commit under the assad regime today statement in the wake of the violence over the weekend call on the interim authority in syria to set out path to transitional justice have the uk position on accountability for war crime under assad change in the wake of that sectarian violence no it have not we announce furth to ensure that vital evidence in relation to the assad regime can be secure and preserve so that there can be accountability our attitude towards the assad regime have not shift in the light of the event over the weekend we be obviously all aghast at the death and terrible violence against minority community in the western coastal region of syria but in the past few week we have also see attack on tishrin dam and neighbouring area by turkish force include the bombing of area where there be civilian what discussion have the minister have with our turkish nato ally about cease the violence in northern syria consider in particular that the pkk over the border in turkey have declare ceasefire discuss these issue with my turkish counterpart in ankara last week it be share position of the british and turkish government that we want peaceful resolution to the tension in northern syria lead to an inclusive government include all the community the development in turkey be clearly welcome include the statement from mr öcalan that the pkk will lay down its arm we do not want to see turkey threaten by foreign terrorist fighter from anywhere include syria but as my hon friend say it be also vital that the violence in northern syria stop the collapse of assad be always go to be setback for russia but it be also always go to be boost for the islamist opposition even if there be only chance of form an inclusive democratic stable syria the government be clearly right to try to promote that but they should also recognise that the real threat to we be chemical weapon fall into islamist hand and the syrian democratic forces no long be able to keep under control those islamists who be currently confine in camp what happen when they be release the right hon gentleman be right about the vital importance of safely destroy the chemical weapon programme in syria be glad

agree that when we talk about pathway to stable and inclusive syria it be important that we and our ally all speak with one voice do agree we have engage closely with our partner and we have travel extensively to the region it be vital that the international community both in the region and beyond speak with one voice to give the good possible chance for the inclusive government that we all want

security implication of those cut in syria and more broadly do not want to sound unduly cheery give the stage of economic crisis in syria but in many respect access to syria for humanitarian aid have get easy since the fall of assad so our aid programme be able to make difference we have million that be not small number make real difference to save life we will be able to say little more about how much far we can go on provide aid into the future at the brussels conference where it will be really important that we talk with our partner too the transitional government have obliquely refer to what they call foreign party in the coastal region of syria but give iran and russia long stand alliance with assad and the alawites it be not difficult to understand who be be refer to give the current uncertainty will the government be very circumspect about who they share intelligence information and datum regard the region with give where it may well end up will not comment unduly on intelligence matter in this chamber but as have say we will look very carefully at the involvement of third party in syria in recent day syria have be and will continue to be an incubator of terrorist threat not just to the region but more widely what work be the government do with ally to contain and degrade that threat the terrorist threat that emerge from syria be very high on the agenda of this government we have be talk with our partner in the region with our american colleague and with many other about what we can do to ensure that in this period of transition and uncertainty isis be not able to take advantage thank the minister for come to the house and make what be very important statement today be he able to make any comment on the continue presence of foreign troop in syria russian turkish american and israeli force be presently occupy at least the demilitarise zone just beyond the golan height what pressure be be apply for the withdrawal of those force and the cessation of their military activity within syria to give syria an opportunity to bring this appalling period to conclusion hopefully with peace and justice in the future the right hon gentleman be knowledgeable on these issue and as he say there be range of different military force in syria under different auspex when there be new full syrian government it will be for they to decide which force should be in their country let be clear about the british position we have be of the view for long time that the russian and iranian presence be malign it will be for the new authority to work out whether they be prepared to accept continued russian presence give all the damage that that russian presence have do to the syrians in relation to the israeli presence in the country to which he allude we have have assurance from the israelis that that presence will be temporary and we expect they to stick to that like the minister be appal by the event in syria this weekend the killing show that the international community need to be more involved in syria please will the government consider push for united nations assistance mission to support transitional government so that all syrians can be protect have be in contact with geir pedersen the senior un envoy in syria and there be ongoing discussion about what far support the united nations might be able to provide to syria we will

the assad regime make the point during that statement that it be critical that there should be safe route to asylum for the most vulnerable and the event of the past few day illustrate exactly why that need to be the case be there safe route to asylum for people if there be not will the minister undertake to raise this directly with his colleague in the home department as say in answer to previous question we will make close assessment of the development in the coastal area at the moment the violence appear to be isolate to that area but we will keep it under close review thank the minister for the statement as chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief express my concern about the slaughter of christians druze and alawites in syria before the civil war in syria be home to approximately million christians by tragically that number have dwindle to around today there be even few under the new regime give these horrify development will the minister review the plan million of aid prepare for syria in the light of the refusal of the interim syrian government to address the ethnic cleansing of christians will the government ensure that aid be deliver on the ground through reputable charitable group rather than those turn blind eye to christian persecution as say before we condemn any sectarian attack and any action to stoke intercommunal tension within syria syria have long benefit from its many minority and its great diversity and that be what we want to see in its future we have give million since the fall of assad we monitor that closely to ensure that it go as the hon gentleman say through reliable channel with proper control to ensure that there be no misuse an arab proverb go well hundred day of tyranny than one day of anarchy we see the result of that anarchy over the weekend with potentially over civilian kill would the government support well resource integrate united nations group with beef up mandate and potentially new syrian envoy familiar with the country and who speak arabic to help resolve the issue as say in response to previous question we be in discussion about what un role could be in future syria will not comment too much on what personnel might staff it be the delisting of institution from sanction on friday the product of engagement with the interim government if so in the light of the gruesome mass murder of saturday be that decision premature it be true that the interim administration be ask for sanction relaxation but want to draw the house attention to the economic situation in syria of the value of the syrian pound have disappear and of the population live below the poverty line this be an acute emergency and we want to see now assad be go syria as

policy how do get an answer for my constituent from the treasury and how should take this forward first thank the hon member for give notice of the point of order the chair be not responsible for

unacceptable crime and policing bill second reading relevant document fourth report of the women and equalities committee tackle non consensual intimate image abuse hc correspondence from the minister of state for policing fire and crime prevention to the home affairs committee on the crime and policing bill report to the house on february beg to move that the bill be now read second time the crime and policing bill will make our street safe put neighbourhood police back at the heart of community after year of neglect give law enforcement the power it need to protect the public and tackle the most serious violence help community to take back their town centre from thief and thug and support the government safe street mission mission for the whole country to halve knife crime and violence against woman and girl in decade and to rebuild confidence in police and the criminal justice system by tackle the local crime that most undermine our community across our country we have strong community british tradition of respect for the rule of law and for each other and british policing tradition that go back to peel of police by consent with the police embed in community and resident pull together to prevent and tackle crime yet in recent year those tradition have become badly fray too many town centre neighbourhood and public space be plague by antisocial behaviour and shoplifting and street theft have soar while neighbourhood police have be heavily cut back too many family be force to endure the agony of an empty chair at the dinner table night after night have lose love one to knife crime but it be easy than ever for child to get hold of lethal weapon online there be barely any penalty for gang who recruit child into crime they get away with it too many woman and girl still face stalk spiking violence and abuse and feel unsafe on the street and in their home even now nearly year on from the first reclaim the night march in leeds too many child still experience sexual abuse and exploitation include by groom network on the street and online and online abuse be get bad and bad yet the child protection reform that we and other call for year ago be still not in place trust in the police be undermine by vet failure and abuse of power but the action promise several year ago to raise standard be still not in place across the country too many of we just hear the same thing people do not see the police on the street any more they worry that respect for law and order have disappear and they fear that if something go wrong no one will come and nothing will be do that be why it be time for change and for the measure that we be set out in the bill safety and security be the bedrock of opportunity and the underpinning of every strong community the safe street mission be at the heart of our plan for change because everyone have the right to live in freedom from fear the right hon lady make an important point about neighbourhood police do she agree that local police station should be integral to this plan local police station be matter for local force but they can be central part of neighbourhood policing which sadly have be heavily cut back in recent year in fact in many area of the country neighbourhood policing have be cut by third or nearly half at the heart of the government plan be rebuild neighbourhood police we plan to put more neighbourhood police and police community support officer back on the beat over the course of this parliament kick start with million of funding in the next financial year we will reverse the damage do by the conservative government through year of cut to community police there be half as many pcso as there be year ago and many thousand few neighbourhood police officer some of people say that they never see an officer on the beat that figure have double since as too many neighbourhood police have just disappear rise rise will give way first to my hon friend and then to the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty report by harlow council in state that few than half of resident in harlow feel safe go outside after dark do my right hon friend see the neighbourhood policing guarantee as part of the way of solve that problem my hon friend be right neighbourhood policing be crucial but neighbourhood police team have be decimate and even those that remain be often abstract or merge with other team that have be deeply damaging it be crucial to get those neighbourhood police back on the street back into our town centre and back into our community give way to the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty who hope will apologise for the scale of cut that his party government bring in the right hon lady mention neighbourhood police but of those will be new warrant officer believe that will be operational police officer bring back from other place when will police force find out what their share of those police officer will be how will the officer currently in other role be reassign give that operational matter be the responsibility of chief constable not the home secretary we have start with million of funding for the next financial year to kick start the drive to put more neighbourhood police and police community support officer back on the beat already police force have be work with the home office on plan for recruit new police officer and new pcso and for redeploy exist police officer and backfille by recruit other officer to take their post we will set out in due course plan for the next financial year and that million the cut to neighbourhood police over the past decade be even bad than we have think the previous conservative government be so indifferent to neighbourhood police that they do not even keep proper count of who be do that work too often they treat neighbourhood police officer just the same as response officer or local detective team and home office guidance allow force to report some of their response officer as neighbourhood police the last government do not have proper check in place and as result hundred even thousand of officer and pcso be miscount later this month the home office and the national police chiefs council will have to publish revised force by force figure so that community can see properly what be happen in their area this government take seriously neighbourhood policing which must be community lead policing in our town and on our street thank the home secretary for give way it be courteous of she on miscounting number can drill down on the point raise by my hon friend the member for huntingdon ben obese jecty of the new neighbourhood officer that the home secretary claim she be recruit will be divert from the exist workforce so they be not new be they will she also confirm that her police funding settlement will lead to officer be withdraw sadly do not hear an apology for the previous conservative government massive cut to neighbourhood policing which mean that many town and city right across the country see neighbourhood police number slash in half community be badly let down be sure that the next conservative member to intervene will begin their question with huge apology for the damage that their party and government do rise be really pleased that the hon member be ready to give an apology for the deeply damaging legacy of his party in government thank the home secretary for give way but think she should apologise for not answer the question there be record level of police under the last government extra police officer be recruit ask she again she say that she be recruit new neighbourhood police officer but will she confirm that of those will be divert officer they be not new be they still no apology for the deep damage the conservatives have do let we be clear they halve the number of pcso and they cut the number of neighbourhood police officer probably by more than but we can not be precise about that because their measuring of neighbourhood police officer be so ropey and all over the place that we can not be certain what the cut be precisely this government be commit to increase neighbourhood policing and pcso by in the first year the neighbourhood police increase will be fund by million that funding be already deliver plan from police force across the country which we will set out in due course to increase the recruitment of new police officer and pcso and redeploy some police officer whose post will then be backfille through the recruitment of other new police officer and conservative member should hugely welcome these measure because they mean that we will get police back on the street and into our community and neighbourhood for the first time in year antisocial behaviour be break community in place like windhill baildon cottingley and denholme it be direct result of the cut make to neighbourhood police by the conservative party when speak to local resident they express concern about the misuse of firework drug dealing fly tipping and the dangerous use of bike and scooter will the secretary of state reassure and my resident that as part of the safe street mission the new neighbourhood police will tackle antisocial behaviour in community like mine as matter of urgency my hon friend be exactly right that we need the police back on the street let we be honest everyone can see this in their community people know conservative members may think that everything be hunky dory at the end of their year in government but community across the country can see the reality as part of our neighbourhood policing guarantee we need to get more boot on the beat and we need more town centre patrol by officer who know the community and be trust by they to go after local perpetrator and prevent persistent crime these be not outlandish demand they be just the basic we need return to the peel principle that lie at the heart of british policing include the principle that the police be the public and the public be the police we need trust officer in the community work to keep people safe the bill give neighbourhood police more power to tackle the local crime that undermine and damage community antisocial behaviour street theft shoplifting harassment in our town centre in too many area those power be too often weaken travel around the country and many other will have hear the same story too many time shop owner who say that thief have become increasingly brazen crime drive by organise gang elderly shopper who say that they do not go into town any more because they do not feel safe people who have have their phone steal in the street with all the detail of their life rip away from they and resident drive mad by the soar number of roar off road bike and scooter drive in an antisocial and intimidating way in the two year before the election shop theft go up by more than snatch theft mainly the theft of mobile phone go up by more than in two year thousand of such crime be report every single day yet the police have be leave with too few power to act too often because of change make by the conservative government year ago they have be leave with weaken power to tackle those antisocial behaviour and crime welcome the introduction of new offence of assault shop worker have be in shop in worksop where have see shop worker who be absolutely fearful of what will happen next and have see food steal before my eye do the secretary of state agree that local shop must become no go area for lawbreaker my hon friend be right the bill introduce strong action on retail crime thank the union of shop distributive and allied workers the co op the british retail consortium the association of convenience stores and more for their determined campaigning over many year to protect shop worker they be the staff who keep their shop open and keep our local community go through the pandemic but in recent year they have have to face truly disgraceful escalation in threat abuse and violence our party have campaign on this measure for very many year through the bill we will introduce specific offence of assault retail worker send the message loud and clear that these disgraceful crime must not be tolerate because everyone have right to feel safe at work the home secretary have talk about neighbourhood and community but have not hear her talk about the rural community that represent and the rural crime force what will the bill deliver for they be very lucky to be in leicestershire where we have rural crime team which see crime drop by in its last report but machinery be take have massive impact can she talk through any measure that be be bring forward that will benefit my community the hon member be exactly right to draw attention to that our rural community see different kind and pattern of crime but it be very often drive by organise gang who think that rural community will be soft touch we have sometimes see that with gps machinery for factory we believe that strong action be need there the minister for policing fire and crime prevention be work with the national police chiefs council on new rural crime strategy know that she would be happy to follow up on any specific issue that the hon gentleman want to raise too often crime be dismiss as low level even though they leave resident in living nightmare and corrode community life so here be the thing that this labour government crime and policing bill will change we be introduce new respect order that the police and court can use to ban repeat offender from town centre or to put new requirement on repeat perpetrator in order to prevent they cause havoc in the community for example requirement to take up drug or alcohol treatment currently the police can not immediately seize bike or vehicle that be be use in dangerous intimidating or antisocial way they give warning and have to hope that they catch the same person again but that mean that there can be two three four or endless strike against the person and the bike will still be on the road frankly one strike should be enough under the bill if the police find somebody use bike or vehicle in dangerous or antisocial way they can seize it straightaway and get that dangerous damage bike off the road we will give the police strong power to tackle the rise amount of snatch theft we will all know constituent friend or family member who have have their phone steal and who could track it maybe through find my iphone or similar service but when they tell the police where their phone be nothing be do we will give the police new power so that where they have electronic evidence from track technology on the location of steal good they can enter and search premise without wait for warrant to be put in place minister be also work with tech company and the police to pursue strong action on design out and disincentivise phone theft so that we can go after the criminal gang make people live misery by steal phone on the street we will take strong action on shoplifting some year ago the conservative government introduce new rule categorise shop theft below that amount as low value that send the signal which have shape the police response ever since that such crime should not be take seriously it become tory shoplifter charter signal to thief and gang across the country that they could operate with impunity wander from shop to shop and steal away because nothing would be do that kind of crime spread it create sense of lawlessness and huge anger and frustration among the law abide majority who see criminal get away with it and respect for the law hollow out this government will finally end the damaging rule do the secretary of state agree that this be not just about the shoplifting but about the fear it create in our community include among our shopworker our local corner shop and accessible shop be there for elderly people who can not always get out to the big supermarket or other people who have difficulty do so and shoplifting have put they in fear as well my hon friend be right this be about the fact of the crime the disrespect but also the sense of fear that it can create and the huge frustration among shopworker about the crime that they see be glad to see some sign of change in heart on the conservative benches with conservative members recognise how damage their approach to town centre crime have be the shadow home secretary the right hon member for croydon south chris philp have write on facebook that the police must have zero tolerance to shoplifting and phone theft in croydon otherwise it will escalate steal even less than be illegal the police must focus ruthlessly on catch criminal and always pursue every line of inquiry who would have think it if that be what the right hon gentleman now believe why on earth do he not take the opportunity during the two year that he be the police minister to scrap the threshold which send all the wrong signal to the police we do know one part of the shadow home secretary remedy for the disappearance of neighbourhood police and the soar level of town centre crime he have say that the wide public do have the power of citizen arrest and where it safe to do so would encourage that to be use include potentially physical challenge otherwise it will just escalate put aside the intriguing suggestion that the shadow home secretary wander around with handcuff in his pocket wonder whether he have misunderstood the peel principle that the police be the public and the public be the police what that principle mean be neighbourhood police in the community not leave the community to pick up arm because the neighbourhood police have go as for reform members it look as if they be too busy deal with their own internal antisocial behaviour to even show up this government will be tough on crime and tough on the cause of crime something that have not happen for far too long alongside the action on community crime the bill introduce much strong measure on some of the most serious crime of all include the knife crime that be destroy young life teenager and young people who do not get to achieve their ambition or fulfil their dream with parent and family leave bereft rise rise will give way first to my hon friend the member for wolverhampton west warinder juss and then will give way to my hon friend the member for read central matt rodda last year only four in knife possession result in any formal criminal justice outcome do the home secretary agree that by increase police power to seize retain and destroy knife that may be legally own but may be use in commit crime we will reduce the number of people carry knife my hon friend make really important point we need to prevent people especially young people get access to those dangerous weapon in the first place but also to make sure that there be proper intervention include referral to youth offend team we must not have system that simply shrug its shoulder when young people be catch carry knife knife enable offence record by the police rise by in the two year up to last summer many people in this house will know the story of ronan kanda who be just when he be stab to death with ninja sword just yard from his home he be kill by two other teenager who have buy not just that sword but more than other lethal weapon online with no question ask and no proper check it be because of the tireless campaigning of ronan mum pooja that we have already launch plan to ban ninja sword follow this summer implementation of the zombie knife ban and commission commander stephen clayman to do an end to end review of knife sale that review be publish few week ago and it be drive some of the new measure we be introduce as part of this bill rise rise will give way to my hon friend the member for read central and then will give way to the hon member for huntingdon but let just make couple of other point first the bill increase the maximum penalty for offence relate to the sale and possession of offensive weapon from six month to two year imprisonment follow the clayman review we will also bring forward amendment to the bill in this house to introduce strict age verification check with stringent two step age verification system for online knife sale so that customer have to submit photo id at the point of purchase and again on delivery it will be legal requirement to hand package contain knife to the buyer alone thank the home secretary wholeheartedly for her work on this important matter in my constituency year old olly stephens be attack and brutally murder by two other boy they have see hundred of image of knife online on different social medium platform warmly welcome in particular the consultation that she have announce to look into the potential penalty for tech executive who fail to act responsibly in this important area my hon friend raise an important point and he have raise the terrible case of the killing of olly stephens with before know how incredibly devastating that have be for the whole community he be right that the online system have make it far too easy for young people to get hold of lethal weapon there be also the content that too many of our young people be see online that be why the measure as part of the online safety act to strengthen the requirement on tech company around material visible to child will be important too those be expect in the summer my hon friend be also right that we will bring forward amendment during the bill passage to give effect to our manifesto commitment to introduce personal liability measure for senior manager of online platform that fail to take action on illegal content concern knife and offensive weapon we will introduce requirement for seller to notify bulk or suspicious sale of knife to the police we have see case where young people be able effectively to become arm trader buy huge number of illegal weapon that should not have be sell to they and then distribute they in the community knife crime be grave issue and welcome any measure that can help to reduce it have debate next thursday on knife crime and hope to see good representation from all part of the house in debate how we can reduce the number of child and young people involve in knife crime whether as victim or perpetrator the question would like to ask be about knife sale online some of fatal stabbing involve kitchen knife and only involve zombie knife appreciate that measure be in place to reduce the ability of people to obtain kitchen knife online but everybody have drawer full of knife at home how can we take measure to reduce that the hon member make an important point we know there be an issue with young people be able to get some of these lethal weapon it become part of what they want to do and part of the search for status be to carry particular kind of weapon but he be right that people can get access to dangerous knife in different way we need strong prevention across the board that be why the young futures programme we be work on be particularly important the government commitment to introduce young futures programme to prevent young people from be draw into crime be welcome especially as youth service and hub be hollow out under the conservatives do the home secretary agree that prevention must be at the centre of the mission to tackle knife crime in our community and our country my hon friend be right to tackle this devastating crime we must address prevention whether online or in the community and access to weapon there be also the response when young people be find carry knife and the wide punishment and response as part of the youth justice system there be the intervention to turn thing around too we must also tackle the criminal gang draw young people into crime and violence in the first place that include draw they into county line drug running and the kind of criminal activity that lead to violence to the carrying of knife and to dangerous crime at later stage for the first time under the bill there will be specific offence of child criminal exploitation because gang should never be able to get away with exploit young people in that way the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty mention kitchen knife which be the main weapon that be use will the home secretary look into the issue of pointed kitchen knife which cause so many death exist knife can be blunt or round at the end if there be incentive for that to be do and manufacturer can be persuade to sell knife with rounded end as some already do that be an interesting point it have be raise with we by the coalition against knife crime that we have form bring together campaign family and campaign network and organisation and as result it be be examine far range of measure in the bill along with amendment that will be table make up ronan law pooja ronan mother have say wish this be do

ambition to halve violence against woman and girl within decade an integral part of the safe street mission because no one should live in fear those of we who represent northern ireland constituency be very pleased to know about the clause that will affect northern ireland through legislative consent motion it be important to recognise the benefit that that will have not just here but in northern ireland however there be one or two other that we might like to see in the future have the home secretary have an opportunity to speak to the policing and justice minister in northern ireland about that we have have discussion with northern ireland ministers and be happy for they to continue be very conscious of the time and know that many member wish to speak so want to make some progress now

that be recommend by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and the prime minister and both call for it more than decade ago the bill will make groom an aggravate factor in the sentencing of child sexual offender because these be the most vile and damaging of crime and will introduce new criminal offence to combat the use of artificial intelligence technology in the making or sharing of child sexual abuse material and strong action against those who organise groom online where the scale of abuse and crime be increase steeply thank the secretary of state greatly for give way recognise

the brave police officer up and down the country who on daily basis put themselves in the line of danger to protect we and our constituency every morning when an officer put on their uniform they do not know what they might encounter during their work day they do not know whether they might be attack yet they take that risk to protect we be sure the whole house will want to join in express our thank and gratitude to those brave man and woman for the work that they do on our behalf every single day when be the policing minister year or two ago be move at the national police memorial service

address one or two of the broad point the home secretary raise in her speech before turn to the substance of the bill the first point be about the question of police officer number which she speak about quite extensively notice that she pick out one particular subset of police officer number and wonder why she keep do so think know why it be because the total of police officer last march on march stand at record ever number there be police officer which be more than we have ever have at any point in our country history will the right hon gentleman give way will the right hon gentleman give way what an appeal choice give way to the hon member for stockport navendu mishra the shadow home secretary be make an important point but do he accept that between and the population of the uk increase and so do the complexity of crime often meet police officer in my constituency and across greater manchester who be stress out and work very long hour often cover for other officer do he accept that the argument he be make be slightly flawed because the population have increase the complexity of crime have increase and the amount of time officer spend on tackle crime have change as say there be record ever number of police officer but if the hon gentleman want to measure police officer number against demand one of the relevant metric to consider can have another go be just go to answer the question if may one of the relevant metric to consider be the overall volume of crime that the police have to investigate that might be the number that one look at in decide whether police number need to go up will the right hon gentleman give way be just go to actually make the point first if may accord to the crime survey for england and wales which the office for national statistics say be the only statistically meaningful measure of crime between and just to pick couple of arbitrary date at random overall crime fall from million to million incident or reduction of so over that period we see reduction in overall crime but an increase in the number of police officer to that record number those be the fact do the shadow home secretary recognise that the number of report crime involve sexual violence go up by under his government when he talk about police number would he also like to mention how many police officer leave because of condition in their police force and because of mental health and physical health issue attrition in the police force be something we need to take very seriously be try to recall the number but from memory each year approximately to of police officer leave owe to retirement and far approximately to leave before their retirement age non retirement rate of leave be of course much low than in most profession but be sure we would all like it to be low the last government start do work on mental health support for police officer which be sure the current government will continue let say word about the future because have hit record ever police officer number be rather anxious to make sure rise rise rise be go to make some progress but then will give way be rather anxious to make sure that those record ever number be maintain the funding settlement for the police announce by the home secretary and the policing minister few week ago increase by billion and they make big play of that figure however when we go through the funding pressure that police force across england and wales face and add they all up include the million extra that police force will have to pay in national insurance the funding pressure add up not to billion but to billion the funding pressure in the come financial year which start in just few week time be about million more than the funding increase there be gap and the consequence be that the police force across england and wales may have to cut officer to make up that funding shortfall will the right hon gentleman give way the hon gentleman be show extreme enthusiasm which feel should be reward thank the shadow home secretary for give way he make play of the number from and as former councillor can tell he that the ward represent in have full time police officer and two full time pcso when his government leave office in june the ward have one part time pcso and be third large would he care to apologise to the people of hartlepool for that disgraceful record will not apologise for deliver record police number if the hon gentleman local force be not deploy those officer in the good way he should take that up with his local police and crime commissioner in the light of the number of member who want to speak ought to get on to the bill when first pick up this bill must confess to experience frisson of excitement the home secretary have be in opposition for year not quite long enough but still year and think that during those year she must have come up with lot of good new idea pick up the bill excited to find out what new thing it might contain but as turn the page to scrutinise its content strange feeling of familiarity come over almost sense of déjà vu have see quite few of its measure somewhere before mostly in the last government criminal justice bill the government press release which they modestly issue on first read couple of week ago highlight headline measure check to see how many have be copy and paste from the previous government and the answer be about of they two third of this bill have apparently be copy and paste from the previous government now know the home secretary work closely with the chancellor of the exchequer and view she as something of role model but emulate her copy and pasting be probably not the good thing to do these new measure the spike offence the intimate image offence the duty to report the new criminal offence of possess bladed article with intent and the new maximum penalty for sell dangerous weapon to be all good measure introduce by the last government of course they would have be legislate for by now if not for the unfortunate early general yes it be unfortunate congratulate the home secretary on use the ctrl and ctrl function on her home office computer to emulate so many of the previous bill measure be the right hon gentleman aware that it increasingly sound like he be say that on police power on the measure in this bill on police officer number and on resource the voter get it wrong that sound incredibly insulting to the public frankly an apology would be well be he aware that in southwark we have few officer at the time of the last election which he say come too soon it do not come soon enough for my elector who still have few police officer in than they have in the metropolitan police as whole do in fact have record officer number but it could have have about an extra officer have its police and crime commissioner sadiq khan bother to recruit they in fact sadiq khan be the only police and crime commissioner in the country to miss his recruitment target do my right hon friend agree that the record of conservative police and crime commissioner be unlike that of some police and crime commissioner represent other party in this house in devon and cornwall alison hernandez have oversee the reopening of police front desk perhaps police and crime commissioner represent other party might like to take lesson from that my hon friend be quite right conservative police and crime commissioner do tend to have much well track record on keep police station open and deliver low crime figure want to ask the home secretary some question and maybe the policing minister will respond to they at the end of the debate some measure that be in the previous government criminal justice bill have disappear from this government bill and would be genuinely interested to hear the government think on they one area that be conspicuously miss from this bill be the measure on nuisance begging the previous government intend to repeal the vagrancy act use statutory instrument once new replacement measure contain in the old bill be on the statute book see that the new bill table by this government do not contain those nuisance beg measure could the policing minister either by intervene now or in her wind up speech tell the house what the government plan be around repeal the act or not and around nuisance begging of course be they to repeal that act use statutory instrument without introduce any new measure there would be lacuna in the criminal law be sure the whole house would appreciate an update secondly the previous government criminal justice bill contain measure to compel perpetrator who have just be convict of criminal offence to appear in the dock for sentencing with power to use reasonable force to do so there have be some distressing case in which someone who have be convict then refuse to appear in the dock to face justice that measure as far as can see be not in the new bill and would appreciate know the government think on that the third omission have notice so far relate to the new offence of assault an emergency worker also announce by the previous government might add the criminal behaviour order for people who assault shop worker be welcome but the previous bill as announce contain measure that say if someone repeatedly assault retail worker think it be three time or more they would be subject to electronic monitoring tag do not see that particular provision in this bill again would be interested in the policing minister view on that turn now to matter that the home secretary make great deal of in her speech which be the change make in around shop theft involve good worth or less listen to the home secretary and government communication around this matter one might think it have cease to be criminal offence in that is of course not the case shoplift good of any value include under be and always have be criminal offence subject to section of the theft act will the right hon gentleman give way be just go to develop point and then will be happy to take intervention particularly from the home secretary in it be change from be an either way offence to summary only offence either way mean the offence can be try in the magistrate court or the crown court summary only mean magistrate court only it be still criminal offence and people could still be convict and sentence to up to year in prison for commit it it certainly be not decriminalise in fact the government own impact assessment say that about of the charge for shoplift involve good under and be try in magistrate court if it be ineffective why do of charge relate to good under the home secretary claim that this alteration will herald some sort of extraordinary change in the way shoplifting be treat but would respectfully refer she to page of her economic note which be sure member present have all read silence paragraph say that the central scenario in the government impact assessment assume that the number of charge with this change will remain constant accord to the government own impact assessment there will be no change in the number of charge as result of this alteration the home secretary point to this matter as some kind of silver bullet but be afraid to say that her own impact assessment say something very different indeed the measure have potentially adverse consequence too this be serious point and genuinely ask the home secretary to think about it carefully when the offence be make either way rather than summary only lot of people who be charge will elect to have crown court jury trial instead of magistrate court trial magistrate court trial for not guilty plea be generally hear in six to eight week it be relatively quick but crown court jury trial could take year and half to be hear the first adverse consequence that would caution about be that be make serious point so it would be good for hon member to think about it instead of those case be hear in the magistrate court in six to eight week there could be delay of one and half year be sure that that be not the government intention but that be what could happen if the change be make the second adverse consequence be that if lot of shoplifting case that be currently hear in the magistrate court end up in the crown court before jury valuable and scarce crown court jury trial time that should be use for serious case such as rape murder and grievous bodily harm will be take up with shoplifting understand that the home secretary want to send signal really do but ask the government to reflect carefully on the potential unintended consequence that be serious point and ask the government to consider it the change may end up have the opposite effect from what they intend the home secretary raise one or two other thing that would like to talk about the first of which be knife crime there be some measure in the bill that be design to address knife crime we will support those measure be sure that all hon member want to fight the scourge of knife crime which be responsible for about third of all homicide almost all hon member will have encounter constituency case will never forget attend the funeral of year old elianne andam in croydon she be murder at am on the morning of september on wellesley road in central croydon by year old perpetrator with knife will never forget see the grief that her parent and her little brother kobi suffer be sure that we would all want to fight knife crime for that reason in addition to the measure in the bill which we will support would be grateful if the policing minister could confirm that the patrolling of hotspot start under the last government will continue in area where knife crime be problem and that the funding will continue that could make an important difference it be also important that stop and search power be use in my view take knife off the street be the most important thing in london in the past stop and search take about knife month off the street knife that could have be use to kill someone like elianne be concerned that stop and search number be down due to misplaced concern about community tension encourage the government to get police force to use stop and search more and to amend legislation include pace the police and criminal evidence act code to make the use of stop and search easier speak to police officer in croydon last sunday and he say that he feel that the police be worried about misconduct proceeding if they use the power of stop and search would like to make it easy for police officer to use those power to protect the public would like to hear the government view on that but we be minded to table amendment in this area to give the police more confidence to use stop and search power to save the life of people like elianne when be policing minister about year ago provide some funding to invest in explore new technology to scan for knife at distance of perhaps metre not very far that would mean that people walk down the street in area where knife crime be problem could be scan and if they have knife conceal on their person it would be identify about year ago that technology be emerge and put the money behind it to develop it to the point where it could be deploy be tell by the company do that and by home office official that by about spring version of that technology would be available that could be use experimentally on the street would be grateful to know perhaps in an intervention from the policing minister now whether that work have be carry forward and whether that scan technology be ready to deploy it could think help to take knife off our street and save life would be happy to take an intervention now indicate dissent the minister will come back to it later it seem to that the government good work in this bill in criminalise the possession of knife with intent will be undermine if the police have to wait for someone to take out the knife and commit an attack before they can discover whether they have knife surely if there be separate offence arise from mere possession as my right hon friend say it be particularly important to enable the police to discover that someone possess that knife before they have have chance to do harm with it my right hon friend be absolutely right if we be to prosecute these offence put more potential perpetrator in prison and critically protect the public we need to detect more of the knife that be routinely carry on our city street that mean more stop and search and the use of knife scan technology of the kind just describe to identify those knife before they be use my right hon friend put it very powerfully the opposition may also be minded to table amendment on the setting up of statutory national inquiry into rape gang for some reason the government have only set up local inquiry in five area some local authority be refuse to hold inquiry which be scandalous about town be affect so inquiry into just five of they be not good enough moreover those local inquiry do not have the statutory power under the inquiries act to compel witness to give evidence the chair of the manchester local inquiry resign last year because even then public authority be cover this up we need national statutory inquiry and we intend to amend the bill to achieve that if the government will not agree to one local council and councillor the police and the crown prosecution service be all involve to great or less extent in ignore or even cover up these terrible offence we need to get to the truth thank you for give way we as government be take very seriously the culture of child grooming and gang in your previous role as minister for crime and policing order you say be not the minister short and sharp intervention please in the right hon member previous role he attend meeting could he please explain why not one of those be on child groom the hon lady will know that child grooming fall under the portfolio of the safeguarding minister who during the conservatives time in office have dozen of meeting on that topic have multiple meeting on operation soteria which be design to combat rape and serious sexual assault think that you madam deputy speaker be keen to move on to back bench speech since there be so much interest in this bill there be lot of really good thing in this bill that my right hon friend have not mention particularly around tackle violence against woman and girl with the legislation on stalk some of that work be carry out cross party over the past few year such as on increase the age of consent for marriage from to and tackle force marriage issue hymenoplasty and virginity testing which help put through in the last parliament do my right hon friend agree that we should try to convince the government to introduce legislation around first cousin marriage very serious issue and include in this legislation some of the sexual offence that relate to that support my hon friend proposal around first cousin marriage the health implication be deeply alarming we could take that forward in the bill and put it to vote of the house lastly will the policing minister provide an update on the use of technology to combat crime particularly the use of retrospective and live facial recognition which enable the police to catch criminal who would otherwise not be catch she know that support that strongly and would gladly support she if she want to continue that work will the right hon member give way have to finish now be glad to see so many familiar clause in the bill the opposition broadly support the intent of the bill but what really matter be delivery make sure that those record police number mean that we catch criminal and increase the conviction rate those police number and the result that they deliver be the yardstick by which the government will be measure look forward to scrutinise the bill as it pass through the house and to table constructive amendment during its various stage rise there be five minute time limit call the chair of the justice committee can not possibly do justice to the bill many need and well craft measure in the few minute have so will just talk about its effect on the justice system and raise couple of specific concern the bill introduce number of new criminal offence have count and make change to exist offence the bill be be consider at time when there be significant uncertainty about how the criminal justice system will operate in the future there be two reason for that first the criminal justice system be in bad way last summer prison reach bursting point and emergency measure be need to ensure that convict offender could be send to prison rather than release secondly in december it be announce that the crown court backlog have reach record level of case despite the previous government set target of reduce it to case by now in response to both those crisis the government have commission wide range review one on the criminal court chair by sir brian leveson and one on sentencing chair by david gauke both review be likely to have significant effect on the justice measure in the bill the new criminal offence in the bill will come into effect at time when the criminal justice system be in flux parliament will be ask to consider whatever proposal the government decide to take forward from the review we be legislate to create number of new offence but it be difficult for anyone to know what their effect will be those be both problem leave for the government by the previous government but those difficult matter need to be address as both issue be go on at the same time turn briefly to knife crime which mention in my intervention between april and march people be kill by sharp instrument home office statistic can identify the type of sharp instrument in of those case in of they it be knife where the type of knife be identify be kitchen knife in other word two third of the identify knife use to kill people in that year be kitchen knife there be grow campaign to phase out kitchen knife with pointed tip as an everyday household item and to introduce kitchen knife with rounded tip pointed knife be much more likely to pierce vital organ and sever artery and those injury be far more likely to be fatal of course there be million of pointed knife in drawer all over the country the safe knife group of which be member support pilot scheme in which point kitchen knife would be convert into safe rounded tip knife the government could encourage manufacturer to replace pointed knife with rounded knife and discourage the sale of pointed knife by create price differential they could also support the launch of knife modification scheme to change pointed knife to rounded knife and collect more datum on the type of knife use in any knife relate crime that be now happen for homicide but we ought to extend it be pleased to say that not all of that require legislation we do not need to add to the weight of the bill but those be all matter that need consideration be grateful for the indication that the home secretary give early finally will speak about something that should be in the bill but be not the law as it apply to gypsy and traveller community who face many inequality and prejudice they be seemingly sanction by the previous government by the inclusion of part of the police crime sentencing and courts act which give the police extra power to ban gypsies and travellers from an area for month along with power to arrest and fine they and even seize their home high court ruling in determine that those power be incompatible with the european convention on human right the bill be the first vehicle that could rectify that injustice will the minister in wind up indicate whether the government will attend to that they clearly have to because of the determination of the high court so the soon that be do the well the future of very vulnerable community that be very much discriminated against depend on this hope the government will as they be do in so many other way correct the fault of their predecessor call the liberal democrat spokesperson lisa smart there be element of this bill that we liberal democrats welcome there be also some that we would not spend this much parliamentary time on and some that we raise weary liberal eyebrow at while we dust off the well wear reason why civil liberty really do matter to all of we the big disappointment for we be the miss opportunity the topic not cover and the chance not take we welcome the opportunity to scrutinise the bill as it work its way through committee and beyond we will push the government to go far in some area in other we will suggest that they take themselves off for little lie down in quiet room as they seem to have get themselves little overwrought the key thing that lib dems will be push for be serious commitment to restore proper community policing because without that we simply will not deliver the frontline police that my constituency and community across the country need and deserve we all agree that everyone should feel safe in their own home and their neighbourhood but after year of conservative mismanagement that be not the reality in too many of our community the previous government gutte neighbourhood police by slash over police community support officer since it should come as no surprise that case be close every day without suspect even be identify or that just of report crime result in charge it be really important that we reflect on the impact of that under investment in neighbourhood policing and specifically on the cultural feeling of insecurity and people feel that crime will not be respond to that have pervade every society hear that on the doorstep every time go out it will take long time for we to get back from that completely agree with the hon member that while crime stat be important the way people feel about crime also be hugely important for all our community the issue be feel acutely in constituency like mine in hazel grove in town and village such as marple and romiley shop worker report that they face real surge in shop theft many tell that they have no expectation that the police will respond even charity shop have be burgle these organisation just can not afford to absorb the loss another persistent concern raise by my constituent be the blight of illegal off road bike know that problem be feel in all our constituency from offerton to high lane resident feel intimidate by this antisocial and often dangerous behaviour local officer tell that although they do not lack the power to act they lack the tool resource and capacity to enforce exist law so we will scrutinise the government proposal on this especially as they relate to the new government must return to the neighbourhood policing model with bobby on the beat who be visible trust and properly resource any element of the bill that do that will receive lib dem support what else do we support in this bill part deal with the criminal exploitation of child and other and it be welcome part seek to update the law on sexual offence these part will of course need close scrutiny to make they as effective as they can be but they have lib dem support if this be lib dem bill we would not be talk quite as much about criminalise those who climb on specific war memorial and we would protect the important right to protest rather than make it hard for this right to be exercise we be surprised and more than little bit disappointed that there be no mention in the bill of bring in domestic abuse aggravate offence thank my hon friend the member for eastbourne josh babarinde for the work he have do in this area we all agree that domestic abuse devastate live and that the criminal justice system must properly recognise its severity too many abuser escape appropriate justice because domestic abuse be prosecute under general offence such as common assault or grievous bodily harm which fail to capture the full nature of the crime we urge the government to back this change and ensure that victim and survivor receive the protection that they need and deserve be sure that my hon friend will have more to say on the matter in due course want to be clear about what the hon member say moment ago be she say that climb on and desecrate our war memorial be acceptable behaviour and that she would be happy for that to carry on that seem to be what she be say be sure that be not the case but would love to hear her clarification it be always genuine pleasure to be intervene on by the hon gentleman and be grateful to he for rise to his foot what say be that if this be lib dem bill look forward to one come forward in the fullness of time we would not spend as much time talk about this as criminal act there be many priority for the government and will talk about number of measure that we be disappoint not to see include in this page bill at the expense of the issue he raise for example we have wait with bated breath for the new government to crack down on water company that pollute our river with impunity nowhere be that issue clear than in my community sewage have be dump in our river and part of the chadkirk country estate beloved green space in my constituency be turn into sewage swamp after heavy rainfall in the new year the field beside otterspool road which the council plan to transform into well keep community meadow be flood with raw sewage current law allow the water company to get away with that liberal democrats will continue to push to make sewage dump specific criminal offence so that water company executive can be hold accountable for the damage they do to our community the government failure to reference rural crime even once in the bill be unacceptable hear the home secretary response to the intervention by the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans who be no long in his place and it be indeed welcome that rural crime strategy be on the way but we lib dems will push for commitment to this issue in the bill rural crime be not an inconvenience it be grow crisis the national farmers union report that the cost of rural crime soar to over million in with organise gang target farm machinery vehicle and gps equipment yet few than of police officer be in dedicated rural crime team hear that for myself when meet dozen local farmer at far benfield farm in cowlishaw brow last week clearly hear about the impact that organise fly tipping and organise equipment theft have on farming family finally there be gap in the bill where discussion of regulate or legislate for live facial recognition should be the liberal democrats have be clear that the technology be threat to privacy be discriminatory and do not make our street safe the previous government push ahead with its use despite serious concern from human right organisation legal expert and even their own independent biometric commissioner the police should focus on evidence base crime prevention not roll out flawed and biased surveillance technology any use of it by the police must be transparent unbiased and regulate we can see police force come up with their own rule within which to operate it be long past time for the government to set the framework the system be use be not biased it have be test by the national physical laboratory and the bias problem that exist seven or eight year ago have be resolve the hon lady say that the technology be unregulate it be not supreme court case set out the parameter and they be now enshrine in authorise professional practice which be national college of policing guidance do not recall hear question from the shadow home secretary but be sure that he would welcome the matter be far clarify in the legislation he say at the dispatch box that live facial recognition be not mention in the bill agree be sure that we would both welcome scrutinise it perhaps from different starting point but end up with situation in which our police force be confident that they know exactly what the rule be and exactly how to make good use of any new technology come through the government and this bill have the potential to deliver real change but only if the government listen that mean return to proper neighbourhood policing to give rural police the resource that they desperately need and to protect civil liberty it be time for the government to show that they be serious about prevent crime and enable our police to act when crime have be commit all our community across the whole country deserve nothing less rise the time limit on speech be five minute there be many area in which the british people have have to put up with decline and decay over the past year but the breakdown of law and order might be the most profound victim have feel unprotected criminal have go unpunished and crime have simply go unchecked meanwhile the law abide majority have look on in horror and police officer have feel frustrated without the tool to act be delighted to support the bill which will start to turn the tide on year of neglect welcome the government plan to introduce extra neighbourhood police officer and put name officer in every community to introduce respect order and real punishment for the so call low level crime such as antisocial behaviour and off road bike crime that have plague our community because of the tory amnesty and to protect retail worker include by scrap the tory shoplifter charter which decriminalise theft below remember speak to shop worker in my constituency during the general election campaign they talk about yob walk into shop nick item off the shelf and walk straight out because they know that the police would take no action welcome the government plan to create new duty to report child sexual abuse and increase sentencing for the monster who organise child grooming to crack down on knife crime and the sale of weapon to to give police the power to seize and destroy bladed article and so much more all within month of the home secretary take office urge the government to go far however by strengthen neighbourhood policing which be at the heart of their mission to take back our street the increase power for police officer to tackle antisocial behaviour be among the most important measure in the bill but we must not stop there pcso and local authority enforcement officer do vital work to support the police and be friendly face in our community they too should be give power to deal with low level antisocial behaviour and the yobs on our street we can also make our street safe by introduce stand alone deportation order for foreign national offender who endanger public safety the government have deport more than criminal since take office but often after several thousand of pound have be spend in the criminal justice system also welcome clause which require register sex offender to notify the authority if they change their name that is again about help the public to feel safe and secure as they will know that someone convict of sex offence be not hide among they and victim will know that perpetrator be not repeat their crime somewhere and go undetected because of that ridiculous legal loophole when we be elect we promise our constituent that we would help they to take back control of their street the first priority of any government be to keep their citizen safe at home at the border and around the world and it have be source of national shame that we have not do that for the past year there be lot of work to do to restore public trust but through the bill we will make vital first step towards protect victim punish criminal and prevent crime let finish on this note the shadow home secretary the right hon member for croydon south chris philp say that the general election be unnecessary or regrettable but my telford constituent vote for change and urge the government to get on with it will be as brief as possible because know that other want to get in let start with general point have sit here long enough not today of course but over the year to know that every government come in with criminal justice bill then another year later and then another before the next government come in and start with criminal justice bill will not get into political knockabout on that but as member who have be here long enough will know the reality be that there be always reason why we need another criminal justice bill and so it go on to be little more rational about it if pass law do the job of end crime we would have manage it long ago this be about how we deal with the thing that get behind the crime the centre for social justice recently publish good report call the lost boys it be about the generation particularly post covid of young boy who have become dysfunctional with serious mental health problem and who often end up on the street be suck into gang the attitude and behaviour of those boy give rise to the violence and subsequent murder that take place on the street put knife into someone hand do not make they murderer put knife into the hand of someone who have already be break in the wrong attitude that be where murder and violence come from recommend that ministers read that report because it make staggering reading for we all those young boy be become man they will live in and out of prison and violence drug taking and drug abuse will be part of their life as will abuse towards woman it be boy and man who be responsible for the crime young woman and girl be tiny proportion of the criminal the problem lie with man and boy that be critical if we want to get ahead of this problem and solve knife crime we must understand that crime be commit in the head and brain of those young boy who be subsequently man and the knife be only the final act say to those who recommend the rounding of blade well perhaps but young guy will just go and grind that rounded blade into sharp point and get on with it if that be what they want to do nothing will get in the way of that simply make that observation it be right that the government be tackle assault on retail worker have struggle endlessly to get the police on to the street and to arrest people who be shoplift people be not shoplift for sandwich they be strip store of thousand of pound worth of good it be serious offence of antisocial behaviour and anything more that the police can do to crack down on that be important because it be the first crime that most of our constituent notice and indeed fear shoplifter threaten people in the shop and those serve they and it be important that we get on top of the issue table an amendment to the previous criminal justice bill on cycling and dangerous cycling have that go have also speak to the department for transport and we need to sort out bike and those dangerous fast bike and cyclist on the road who commit offence it would also help if it be make mandatory for all cyclist to have bell so that they could at least warn pedestrian of their approach take my right hon friend point into consideration the point be make be that we have have death on the street yet cyclist could not be prosecute for have kill someone because we be still use piece of legislation from the century to address offensive and wild carriage driving that be not acceptable and it hardly ever convict anybody so encourage the government to look again at dangerous cycling because people genuinely abuse the road traffic act and nothing ever seem to be do to they that be particularly true for bike which be very dangerous when use on pathway even if people be not commit criminal offence they be cause major danger antisocial behaviour be big thing which our constituent notice they feel threaten by people who ride those bike on the pavement it may seem small thing but it be not will end by congratulate the government on introduce the offence of cuckooing the home secretary will know that table an amendment to the previous criminal justice bill and be pleased that the government have pick that up and put it into this bill there be big issue regard people who feel threaten by brutal individual who take over their house and commit criminal offence from there in the end some of those threaten people get arrest themselves have have no control over that house many of they have mental health problem many be stick in backroom and abuse themselves have such an offence allow the police have say this all along to move into the house if they have suspicion that such thing be take place and deal with the issue straightaway congratulate the government on that the previous government accept my amendment hopefully we can all join force have one question for the minister respond to the debate offender often use coercion grooming and manipulation the bill refer to an absence of consent do she think that an absence of consent alone will be good enough to convict people who have carry out coercion grooming and manipulation that be the point be slightly concerned about raise it with the minister and hope she can respond at the end of the debate at the end of it all criminal justice bill be good thing this be huge bill with more than page of measure but wish to focus on the extra power it contain to police protest and particularly clause and about which civil liberty organisation such as liberty amnesty international and big brother watch as well as trade union have raise loud alarm bell also wish to take the opportunity to recognise more broadly the dangerous direction of travel of the increase criminalisation of legitimate and peaceful protest in this country which as many will recognise be be mirror around the world in recent year we have see the introduction of vast swathe of anti protest measure include new police power that have be use increasingly to clamp down on freedom of assembly and expression those power be be extend yet again in the bill the tories controversial police crime sentencing and courts act the public order act and the serious disruption regulation all bring in wide range new power those include allow the police to impose condition on any protest that be deem to be disruptive or to cause serious annoyance to the local community and sentence of up to year in prison for damage memorial such as statue those of we who fight those measure tooth and nail have now see our fear realise with clampdown on the right to protest peacefully last month the aggressive policing of the national palestine protest lead to the arrest of an estimate protester even member of this house be call in for police question as be an year old holocaust survivor who be carry flower to lay for the dead child of gaza we can not underestimate the chilling impact that that heavy handed policing of peaceful protest will have on our basic right and freedom from strike worker to the national palestine demo and farmer protest huge demonstration and protest be become more commonplace across the political spectrum as people across the country and beyond feel that they be lose their voice in their workplace and the political sphere instead of continue down that dangerous road we should be take the opportunity that the bill present to roll back some of those power defend our civil liberty and restore our proud tradition of freedom of speech expression and assembly will the hon lady give way no be not take intervention sorry in this country we have proud tradition of stand up for what we believe in but that have increasingly come under threat and measure in the bill continue on that trajectory hope that the minister and government will take those point on board and consider amendment in committee to roll back some of the draconian anti protest legislation and restore our civil liberty move on which be sure we can find common ground across the house lastly want to turn to the provision in the bill that will far criminalise roma and traveller community and the impact that certain clause will have on gypsy roma and traveller community such as those live on the tara park site in my liverpool riverside constituency in particular want to raise concern around clause in part of the bill which extend police dispersal power and as the traveller movement have state risk lead to even more heavy handed policing of gypsy roma and traveller community as with the anti protest provision in the bill we must see such measure in the broad context of the increase criminalisation of already marginalise community as such hope the government will go back to the drawing board and consider use the bill to repeal section to of the criminal justice and public order act this bill be the first under labour of its kind for generation let we use it as an opportunity to protect our most marginalised community and defend civil liberty thank you for give the opportunity to speak madam deputy speaker want to thank surrey police for all they do to keep we safe in reigate and banstead welcome much of what be in the bill and will not repeat what have already be say instead will focus my remark on what believe be require to tackle the scourge of commercial sexual exploitation in this country it be easy for people to think that sexual exploitation do not affect they and that it do not happen in their neighbourhood but it be more common than many realise it be happen behind close door on very normal everyday street sexual exploitation often of young woman be an awful crime that destroy life before they have barely have chance to begin exploit repeatedly day in day out those young people be treat as merchandise with the sole purpose of turn profit for pimp and trafficker it be incumbent upon we to break the business model start by outlaw the advertising of individual for prostitution classify ad site like vivastreet be rife with it they be the etsy of sexual exploitation fuel sex trafficking by provide convenient centralised platform for sex buyer to access what they want in their local area buy sexual service can be as easy as order pizza although prostitution be legal pimping which be the provision of prostitute to perform sex act with customer for gain be not there be often tell tale sign on the advert like the same phone number be use for multiple ad that the woman be not act freely and willingly and that they be under the control of pimp who be profit from their exploitation such site have have year to get to grip with it but still not enough be be do to weed out those advert however we must take some responsibility too hon member will no doubt be stagger to hear that such advertising of prostitution be entirely legal because legislation have not keep pace with technology advertising prostitution in phone box be illegal under section of the criminal justice and police act yet when the same advert be online it be not illegal that be utterly absurd in the home affairs committee cite evidence in its report on human trafficking that of victim of traffic for sexual exploitation be advertise online the cross party group conclude website advertising prostitution significantly facilitate trafficking for sexual exploitation strongly urge ministers to take this opportunity to close that loophole there be similar issue with the regulation of online pornography compare with offline pornography our current law have not be update quickly enough to recognise the huge shift online and the need to apply the same standard across the board survey by the children commissioner in november find that one in child have see pornography by the age of nine with half have see it before they turn the impact of that travesty can be clearly see with of young people between the age of and state that girl expect sex to involve aggression huge damage be be do to young woman and man by this damaging content which normalise and sexualise the choking and strangling of woman during sex illegal in offline pornography but not online pornography although not illegal per se degrading act like spit on woman be commonplace in online porn so be it any wonder that we be see such disdain for and poor treatment of girl in our society if we be serious about tackle the issue and halve violence against woman and girl we must crack down on online porn and ensure it be regulate to the same standard as that which be offline the independent pornography review lead by baroness bertin recommend that there be parity of regulation between online and offline pornography which very much welcome the main statutory regulator of offline pornography be the british board of film classification it be responsible for classify pornographic content before it can be publish and ensure it do not contain illegal content any such offline illegal content can not be sell or supply in the uk and the same rule should apply online that simple change could be transformational if effectively execute and properly enforce although recognise the technical and practical challenge of try to regulate the worldwide web thank the secretary of state for listen to my two ask look forward to hear from she whether she be receptive to accept amendment to ban online prostitution advert and to bring the regulation of online pornography in line with that for offline pornography when be serve as police officer the demand on police be change rapidly and they continue to do so during my time in the police service we see big increase in the reporting of domestic violence and sexual offence neighbourhood policing be decimate as the police scramble to keep up with the huge increase in the reporting of these high harm previously hide offence that be now thankfully no long tolerate in our society however at just that time the conservatives be busy slash police budget the police workforce shrink by officer across the country statistic that hon member will be very familiar with less talk about but just as important be the fact that our already ancient technology system fall far behind the criminal we seek to catch the police national computer the database that hold arrest and conviction datum for offender across this country celebrate its birthday last year the call handling system use by my old force the country big be year old last year welcome this government focus on policing which be vital in create fair country where everyone feel safe and secure in their local community the bill signal our commitment to rebuild neighbourhood policing and to modernise our police service in order to provide the tool require to keep up with change crime pattern welcome the modernisation of our criminal law in the bill the legislation finally take stalk seriously make it easy to tackle spike and provide common sense power to go after the thief use tracking datum also welcome the focus on shoplifting and antisocial behaviour in our town centre with the introduction of new respect order for persistent offender as promise in our election manifesto every frontline police officer know that huge proportion of crime be commit by tiny proportion of the population through relentless focus on those individual we can make small town like those represent in nelson colne clitheroe and barnoldswick safe and welcome for the law abide public once again hope the bill be the start of debate about what we want our police to do and where our service be well place to act we need our officer to have the backing of this place to tackle both the high harm offence such as serious violence domestic violence and sexual offence but also the common low level crime that blight our community if everything be priority then nothing be if we can be clear eyed about where the police should focus their time and effort then we can set they up to succeed and we can rebuild the public confidence that the police can keep they safe will use my time to talk about domestic abuse my mum and know all too well what domestic abuse look like but be sorry to say that the law do not go far enough to recognise that crime currently there be no specific offence of domestic abuse in the law which leave many survivor without the respect and protection that they deserve instead many domestic abuser be convict of offence such as actual bodily harm grievous bodily harm assault or battery that do not reflect the full gravity of the crime someone could be convict of abh for domestic abuse but they could also be convict of abh for brawl in pub with stranger they have not meet before the domestic abuse act go some way towards recognise domestic abuse in the law it define it formally and create number of offence such as coercive and control behaviour but it do not provide specific offence of domestic abuse lead to all sort of problem for example the government early release scheme which they have to implement in light of the state that the last government leave our prison in let out as many as people early the government make commitment to try to exclude domestic abuser from be release early but it be not possible to comprehensively do that in the word of the lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice the right hon member for birmingham ladywood shabana mahmood because people can be exclude from early release only on the basis of the offence that they commit and nothing else well there be no offence of domestic abuse in the law so many domestic abuser people who be convict of abh say be release early one survivor affect by that situation be elizabeth hudson her abuser her ex husband hold knife to her throat among many other terrible incident at home he be convict of actual bodily harm and he qualify for early release under the standard determinate sentence scheme be we to create specific offence of domestic abuse we could exclude those people from such scheme specifically if we create an offence of domestic abuse aggravate gbh abh assault battery criminal damage or whatever it may be in exactly the same way that we have racially and religiously aggravate hate crime we would be able to protect survivor another advantage of be able to recognise domestic abuse in that way which this legislation in all its word do not yet do be that we could properly cohort those individual ask the ministry of justice how many domestic abuser be in prison at the moment and what their reoffende rate be that be very simple and basic the response be it be not possible to robustly calculate the number of domestic abuser in prison or their reoffende rate this be because these crime be record under the specific offence for which they be prosecute that is there be no specific offence of domestic abuse to convict those people of in the light of those challenge the like of refuge mankind women aid and many more organisation whether it be lawyer academic or survivor themselves be back my proposal to create set of domestic abuse aggravate offence in the law also extend my thank to those member on the government benches who have privately write to to express their support for the proposal that be champion and for proposal that hope the government will accept in their crime and policing bill throughout its passage we need to ensure that we properly respect and protect survivor in eastbourne and beyond and hope that member across this house will work with to help to make that reality my door be always open our community deserve to feel safe on our street in our home and in our shop while be refer to shop it be only right to place on record the tireless campaign that usdaw have do to get specific offence for an assault on shop worker that just show the good of our movement the profile perception and presence of the police need to be restore we need police on our street they need to have the power to do their job and people need to feel safe again our police station in corby be close down in the perception be that the police be go and that their presence be disappear because all people do be drive through what use to be their police station and the profile that go with that where something be formally open all of sudden it be shut our dedicated response unit be move out at the same time and all we have leave be police hub on the upper floor of public building that be sometimes open only two day week we have people on bail be tell to take selfie and send they to number to demonstrate and prove they meet the condition of their bail that be not good enough for the people of corby and east northants many people have lose faith why because for more than decade they have be let down they call and no one show up they report crime and nothing happen they see criminal get away with it again and again here be the truth when policing be cut crime go up and everybody pay the price thousand of officer be rip off our street police station be close down pcso be cut and entire town be leave without proper policing that be not good enough for the people of corby and east northants people feel like the system have give up and do not feel safe in their community the bill toughen up police so that crime have real consequence again it give the police strong power to tackle antisocial behaviour by introduce respect order and strengthen exist power as well as remove the need for the police to issue warning before seize vehicle be use antisocially the bill be key part of deliver the government safe street mission alongside it the government will recruit extra neighbourhood police officer ensure that every community have one the final police funding settlement also provide up to billion for police in england and wales include million for northamptonshire force an increase of more than million as say this be about profile perception and presence that be why be not only urge member to back the bill but lead the campaign to bring police station and dedicated response unit back to corby the government have ensure that the money be there to use and there be consensus in the constituency on the need we have business line up to support we and massive support from people in the constituency who have sign petition for the return of their dedicated response unit and police station with this government and this bill and the funding that they have provide now be the time for we to deliver there be much that be good and necessary in the bill and welcome the fact that of its clause will apply to northern ireland have some disappointment about some of the clause from which northern ireland be exclude in particular clause which relate to the desecration of war memorial we have have spate of such incident in northern ireland therefore be disappointed that that clause do not apply to it in relation to the all important matter of child sexual abuse part of the bill apply to northern ireland with the exception of clause ask the minister to look at why that be because to apply the rest without clause be quite incongruous in clause and so on we will rightly make it illegal to have paedophile manual to describe how to make child sexual abuse image yet clause which make it an offence to possess child sexual abuse image generator do not apply to northern ireland how can that be right there be logic that be absent there clause must apply if the rest of the part be to apply trust that that be an oversight that will be rectify in clause we have hide away something of particular interest to many in northern ireland for the first time it will be an offence to put something on lamp post or to have banner that glorify proscribe organisation that be good and necessary thing welcome the fact that that be the intent the explanatory note tell we that that be exactly the purpose of the clause it would for example enable the seizure of flag or poster which arouse reasonable suspicion the individual who display it be member or supporter of proscribe organisation that be good but it focus attention on the failure of the bill to deal with the inadequacy of the offence of glorification of terrorism which be too limp and largely unused we will arrive at situation in which somebody can not legally put something on lamp post or put up banner that say to use the republican mantra up the ra which mean up the organisation that murder thousand of our citizen and that be good but under the glorification of terrorism legislation they can say it that hideous horrible republican mantra up the ra which be chorus from republican song that glorify terrorism with lyric like the brits will never leave until they blow away ooh ah up the ra sam missile in the sky be glorification of terrorism of course it be yet under our legislation it be not define as glorification of terrorism because person have to be advocate that which they would emulate and encourage other to engage in terrorism some might think that be the case if we take the offence describe in clause and make it apply to that which promote the interest of proscribe organisation we would have do the right thing but that language need to be transfer across to the glorification of terrorism legislation why should it be right for it to be illegal to have banner that say up the ra but legal to address thousand of kid and sing up the ra as happen every august in northern ireland that disparity need to be reconcile and deal with be grateful for the opportunity to speak in today debate on this incredibly important bill like many of my constituent welcome the measure the government be take to tackle serious crime and antisocial behaviour in order to make our street safe pay tribute to the police another public service that have be undervalue and underfunde for well over decade they put their life on the line to keep we safe and uphold the law many measure in the bill will directly impact they and my constituent many of whom have become know to through casework when have knock on door in my constituency resident have tell about the nuisance of off road bike that have blight our street and often our green public space our park and intimidate the public often those bike and their owner be know to the police but they lack the power to do anything other than give the owner simple warning be pleased that the bill would enable the seizure of vehicle that be be use antisocially the other issue that hear about most often on the doorstep be fly tipping the disrespectful fly tipping that be engage in by so many organised criminal few year ago gravesham borough council start fly tip enforcement team it investigate many people and take many to court three year on community protection warning have be issue we have put people in prison and fly tip fine have be issue that be incredible it be what should be happen across the country and be grateful that the bill look to strengthen antisocial behaviour power to deal with fly tipping that be incredibly welcome as new mp hold many surgery as do many members present and have be shock by the terrible experience that some of my constituent have have to face pay tribute to they for have the courage to come forward and tell their story have hear from woman deal with stalking by an ex partner who have change their life routine for fear of attack and as such welcome the bill strengthening of stalk protection order have hear from retire paramedic peter sheehan who be violently assault after simply ask people in his woodland to stop their dog tear up the forest floor it be simple ask after three year of legal issue the man who seriously assault peter be give two year suspend sentence and fin the impact on peter who already suffer post traumatic stress disorder from his work as paramedic be significant and that money still have not be receive we must let people who have experience crime see the justice they deserve their trust in the criminal justice system must be restore and they must know that if they call the police they will come there be consequence for crime and this bill be the first step towards back people not criminal there be much in this bill that welcome because of course it be announce by the last government however this government need to go far and we will push they to do so major part of the bill be its increase focus on neighbourhood policing which be commendable have always advocate in this chamber for great level of neighbourhood police on our street and more visible police in our community pay tribute to my own neighbourhood police team in aldridge brownhills who serve my local community day in day out they be truly locally base officer who care about our local community and thank they for all they do on our behalf sadly my neighbourhood police team will soon find itself without permanent dedicated home because the labour police and crime commissioner have decide to sell off the family silver right across the west midland as well as sell off the police station in aldridge in my patch he be sell our next near police station in sutton coldfield he have already sacrifice the next near one in kingstanding that building be go to become domino pizza takeaway the government want more police officer that be great but in the west midland their own police and crime commissioner do not want to house they it be unacceptable that police station across the west midland be slowly be phase out diminish the role of neighbourhood police all at time when more power be be suck towards central birmingham and the pcc headquarters at lloyd house will the right hon lady give way will not because of time that headquarters have benefit from staggering million worth of upgrade decoration as result of local community lose their local police station include the former brownhills police station in phase of the closure programme surely that be not right draw the minister attention to several write parliamentary question to which do not believe have receive full answer in particular my question concern the funding of the propose new neighbourhood police officer while those new officer be welcome as have state the government have not yet fully say how they will be fund after the first year so would be grateful for clarity on that it be imperative that there be certainty that those be fully fund new officer who will be add to base budget for future year not one off government expenditure after which the local taxpayer will pick up the tab through an increase in the precept the government face similar question regard their decision to fund national insurance increase once again they have be circumspect in their response to my question in westminster hall and to write parliamentary question it be very important that the minister come clean today and clarify that the grant give to police authority to cover the chancellor job tax be not just one off but will be add to those authority base budget as the minister be very aware if that be not the case this will be yet another stealth tax by the back door by this government punish our constituent there be so much in the bill that would like to talk about but before conclude will touch briefly on knife crime welcome the government commitment to halve knife crime which come on the back of series of measure pass by the last conservative government sadly in my constituent james brindley lose his life to knife crime in aldridge since then his parent have dedicate their life to help eradicate the scourge of knife crime they have establish the james brindley foundation to help educate young people across the borough of walsall to turn their back on carry knife back in august be really proud to be present at the unveiling of one of number of knife bin across the borough fund through that foundation with help from local business and sponsor james parent have simple ask and will be bit cheeky and press the minister on it today will she work with her colleague in the department for education to see whether knife crime prevention could be consider for inclusion in the national curriculum my constituent demand safety which be why the last conservative government fully fund new police officer we welcome the new police officer but my constituent want they to be fully fund and house in the neighbourhood the bill fail to give all the guarantee that be look for on that basis hope the minister can provide with some clarity when she sum up the debate rise order we have very oversubscribed debate so it be unlikely that everybody will get to speak be bring in four minute time limit with immediate effect just to try to get more people in much within the bill will bring significant positive change to community like mine in hemel hempstead where crime and in particular antisocial behaviour continue to be major issue under consecutive conservative governments criminal get an easy ride the conservatives leave great mess and this bill help to fix that could speak at great length on many part of the bill but will focus on two that be almost always at the top of my postbag in hemel hempstead antisocial behaviour and the current epidemic of shoplifting recently meet couple call gary and margaret not their real name whose case shock for two year gary and margaret have be harass include verbal abuse trespassing and the damaging of their property by an offender who live on their street the family feel unsafe and isolated with the harassment worsen the mental health of their eight year old son who suffer from severe anxiety and be too scared to play outside they inform that they have be in constant communication with the council and the police but have face rejection from the local council antisocial behaviour department which state that they would not intervene due to the low level nature of the antisocial behaviour it be not just antisocial behaviour affect people in hemel hempstead we also face an epidemic of violence against retail staff as other member have mention meet employee from the co op in queens square in adeyfield and have also meet people from the post office in the same square be grateful to those from the co op for the time they take to show their store include their cctv room but be shock by what see there an entire table of cd after cd each contain evidence of shoplift in the store with many people brazenly walk out of the shop not even attempt to conceal their theft what be more disturbing be what one of the store employee tell shoplifter have be catch and the store have manage to get the police and the criminal justice system to take the case to court that brave employee have be to court to testify against the shoplifter unfortunately the case be throw out and the perpetrator let off and able to walk free even more shockingly the employee have to sit on the same bus home as the person she have just give evidence against thankfully provision in the bill will make difference for that employee for gary and for other who have be the victim of crime and antisocial behaviour first clause and respect order will give the police and local authority what they need have in the past ask for hemel hempstead to be consider for respect order pilot and hope the minister will forgive for make another pitch for that today it disgust that hard work people in hemel hempstead pay for their shopping while other can simply storm out without pay it disgust that people in my constituency have to put up with antisocial behaviour on an almost daily basis while the perpetrator walk away with impunity have be out with the police for ride along the purpose of which be to see at first hand the challenge that the police be face have have meeting with police federation rep so be well aware of the extra equipment and support that they need will continue to do everything can to support those brave police officer face antisocial behaviour and be strongly in favour of this bill which believe will give the police extra power to do more to crack down on these yobs there be much more would like to say but much like our police force under george osborne and theresa may have have to subject my speech to brutal cut so will finish there there be much in the bill with which my party agree in fact many of its provision be write by my party in government so it be strange to hear the more partisan remark from the home secretary early in the debate after decade in which crime be fall that happy trend have sadly begin to reverse the home secretary note that overall crime increase by in the last year but she do not admit that it be still far low than when labour be last in office however there be obviously much to be do the sentencing guideline publish last week explicitly instruct judge that pre sentence report will normally be consider necessary if the perpetrator of crime be from an ethnic minority cultural minority faith minority community or be female transgender drug addict or victim of modern slavery traffic or exploitation the guideline be clear that minority should receive less punishment than white people especially white man the provision about slavery trafficking and exploitation be an invitation for lawyer to help illegal immigrant to escape the reach of the law that be not the first official direction to tell judge to put identity politic before the once sacred principle of equality before the law last july the judicial college equal treatment bench book say that in order to treat some person equally we must treat they differently put that principle into practice the bench book warn for example that the family impact of custodial sentence be particularly acute for black mother as far more black family be head by lone parent similar attitude exist in police the police race action plan publish by the college of policing promise to stop the over policing of black community and complain that such community be over policed but under protect the action plan note that black people be more likely than white people to be murder and to be victim of knife crime but it fail to add that black people be more likely to commit these crime too order remind the hon gentleman that we be talk about the second reading of the crime and policing bill and its content indeed find it baffle that we be debate the future of the criminal justice system and not talk about the erosion of the principle of equality before the law disparity in policing and criminal justice do exist order remind the hon gentleman again that in order to speak in this debate he need to stay in scope of the content of the bill in front of we thank you madam deputy speaker be go to turn to some specific measure in relation to police reform and the bill accord to the government impact assessment the bill will provide an additional to prison place yet the government expect to see additional crime record by the police annually result in prosecution and conviction per year those number do not add up unless the government intend to continue their policy of release prisoner early pass legislation be not substitute for genuine and sophisticated police and criminal justice reform and will make some suggestion to the government first we should abolish the national police chiefs council which represent centralised unaccountable power and transfer its function to more accountable entity the college of policing should be direct by the home secretary to ensure that force focus more clearly on crime fighting we need to reduce the size of the met in london with its national responsibility transfer to the national crime agency the government need to give police chief the ability to clear out fail officer and recruit talent from all walk of life in the met there should be few deputy assistant commissioner and few commander training need to be professionalise and well record and workforce planning need to be improve there should be well use of productivity improve technology and streamlined process from arrest to prosecution we need to reform the police grant to make sure that force focus on strategic threat new technology mean that fraud identity theft and cyber crime will present huge challenge we can no long expect police force to recruit generalist officer hop that they can all offer the perfect blend of leadership empathy strength and investigatory skill instead we need great specialisation as say it seem crazy that we be debate this bill without debate whether we remain equal before the law there be much to be welcome in the bill but hope we will see far great energy in the undeniably tough job of police reform crime in hyndburn and haslingden be currently out of control robbery have skyrocket in my constituency by in the past year which be far bad than the already shocking increase that we have see across lancashire shoplifting have soar by which again be significantly bad than the rise across the county those number be not just statistic they represent victim business owner whose livelihood be threaten family who feel unsafe and community tear apart by lawlessness indeed just last week local business in accrington see around break in almost half of my experience violent report march vol correction that be unacceptable and be speak here today because refuse to accept it any long just over the weekend an awful video have sadly be circulate on social medium of yet another terrible incident of violent crime in hyndburn this government crime and policing bill be the big crackdown on crime in decade we be take back our town centre from thug and thief and restore respect for law and order give our community and police the tool they need to fight back for too long the crime that have make accrington town centre almost lawless the so call low level offence have be ignore when shoplift antisocial behaviour and street crime go unpunished our high street suffer our economy decline and our community start to lose hope accrington be once thrive hub it have be neglect for too long but these new power for the police be key to turn that around the bill deliver real action the police will no long need warrant to search premise when steal good be track electronically and there will be no more safe haven for criminal respect order will clamp down on public drinking and drug taking ensure that our street be no long place of disorder officer will have the power to seize nuisance vehicle such as the off road bike see on friday tear up our park in rishton on the spot crucially the day of treat theft under with effective immunity be over stealing be steal and criminal will be hold to account it be also welcome that the government listen to the campaign organise by the union of shop distributive and allied workers and other shop worker for the introduction of new offence of assault shop worker in this vital bill the labour government be not just tough on crime they be invest in solution welcome the provision of new police officer to ensure that every community have its name police officer this be part of the government million investment which will deliver funding uplift in lancashire enough be enough the people of hyndburn and haslingden deserve safe street thrive town centre and the right to live without fear the bill deliver that and be proud to support it crime and police in london be at crisis point figure show that government funding for the metropolitan police have fall by more than billion in real term since and those cut mean that we do not just need more bobby back we need more beat park police no long patrol and now we see the prospect of safe school officer across london be move out of school where they would be work with young people at risk of gang or county line to back fill neighbourhood policing team community policing be in tatter officer number be insufficient and pcso number in london have fall by more than in the last year from in to just in which mean that almost three out of every four officer have be lose in that time while we liberal democrats broadly welcome many aspect of the bill we be fundamentally concerned about the likelihood that without enough officer on the ground community policing will continue to suffer over the year successive labour and conservative governments have introduce their own version of crime and police bill but london nevertheless record more than knife crime incident nearly half million theft and more than case of sexual violence last year it be simply common sense that if we want to get grip on these awful incident which undermine the very fabric of trust society we must restore community police for londoners that mean sort out recruitment in the met across the whole of london it mean end the practice of abstract police officer from outer borough to assist inner one and instead focus on recruit more officer to be visible engage and dedicate to protect the community that they serve can not see the many welcome part of this bill be implement effectively in my constituency and across london if that be not the case the bill in its current form should go far and fast in restore proper community police reform stalk law to support victim and implement meaningful public health approach to knife crime have speak about both those issue number of time in the house and have receive very positive response from the minister be encourage to see that assault against retail worker be to be treat as the grave crime that they be but these provision should go far to protect tradespeople from harm wherever they work tool theft be devastating crime that cost tradespeople million last year research from nfu mutual show that one in three tradespeople now live in constant fear of violent thief some have be brutally attack with crowbar and other weapon just for try to protect their tool from be rip out of their van at stop tool theft rally in parliament square last month organise by trades united speak to many tradespeople who have suffer theft and attack and hear that they would not now let their vehicle out of their sight for fear of become victim there have be discussion of well measure on the part of vehicle manufacturer to reduce the number of theft such as well lock and keyless system security but the description of people literally cut off the top of van to steal the tool inside demonstrate that such measure can only go so far to stop the theft however these attack on tradespeople be more than just theft they be an assault on their hard work and hard earn livelihood it be time to acknowledge the escalate danger that they face and provide strong legal safeguard to protect their livelihood and wellbeing and hope the government will take note of that in committee this labour government have make the unprecedented commitment to halve violence against woman and girl in decade know that my colleague on the front bench take it extremely seriously and agree with they that it will require transformative approach welcome the measure in the bill to tackle intimate image abuse stalk spike and the sexual exploitation of child which mark the beginning of the government work to make good their ambition by give victim the protection that they deserve and need in that spirit believe that the bill present an opportunity for the house to tackle commercial sexual exploitation key form and engine of violence against woman and girl in give victim of the sex trade the measure and protection that they need and intend to table the appropriate amendment to reflect that the majority of people exploit through the sex trade be woman and girl while the overwhelming majority of people who pay to exploit they sexually be man extensive evidence show that most woman exploit through this insidious trade be highly vulnerable before their involvement and suffer acute harm as result include disproportionate risk of violence know that my right hon friend the policing minister who chair the home affairs committee in the last parliament have do some excellent work in this area sadly the demand for sexual exploitation be not be deter and victim themselves face the threat of criminal sanction the bill give we an opportunity to change that to end impunity for punter who pay to abuse woman to take concrete action against pimp website and to remove the threat of criminal sanction from victim to offer those vulnerable woman the support that they need the bill do much for victim of crime and abuse and it be evidence of the government treat violence against woman and girl as the emergency that it be believe that by strengthen the response to commercial sexual exploitation we can make significant headway in halve that violence speak of highly vulnerable woman whose plight drive much of the work that do want to say something about abortion the law underpin abortion date back to before woman even have the right to vote under that cruel and outdated law about woman have be investigate by the police in the past five year alone and another woman be set to go on trial in april the woman catch up in this law be very vulnerable and often desperate but they be subject to the same law that apply to violent partner who use physical abuse coercion or poisoning to end pregnancy without consent the law should be tool to protect those woman not to punish they for the effect of the abuse that they have suffer westminster vote to repeal the law criminalise woman in northern ireland in but they remain in place in england and wales there should be parity in the law across the uk so that my constituent have the same right as my colleague constituent in northern ireland abortion remain free vote issue and recognise that any change in the law in this area must be lead by back benchers my right hon friend the minister be commit to this change before the election last year and member on both side of the house support her amendment to remove these woman from the criminal law hope that the bill will give we an opportunity to revisit this issue in the same collegiate way welcome many of the measure in the bill particularly those concern knife crime and the protection of shop worker who all too often bear the brunt of antisocial behaviour however one of the big deterrent for criminal be the certainty of be catch and reduction in police number nationally be as wrong as they be locally in avon and somerset the former conservative police and crime commissioner cut pcso by further last year massive reduction and close our taunton police report march vol correction welcome clause provision on public space protection order which will come on to welcome the commitment to deliver extra officer of various kind but worry for be the fact that my constituent have come to see about their relative who be serve police officer civilian have be replace by officer in uniform do the same civilian job just so that it can be claim that police number have increase hope the minister will make sure that that do not continue to occur with the new recruitment which be very welcome unless officer be see in our community and on the street they will not deter or catch the criminal we need they to catch last autumn be contact by business in castle green in taunton which be at their wit end because of the antisocial behaviour in the historic centre of our county town contact the chief constable straightaway be really grateful to avon and somerset officer for the effort they have put in as be to the chamber of commerce in taunton which have raise the general issue of town centre crime and convene the safe street forum that attend last week but it be clear that we need to deter antisocial behaviour and crime where it be take place that be prove by the fact that lib dem run taunton town council have just appoint street marshal who be on duty in our town centre spend the afternoon with nick last friday he be do an excellent job and cover huge range of work from people climb all over the rooftop to retrieve thousand of pound worth of stock by simply ask the person responsible to hand it over he must have be quite persuasive in ask the individual to do that congratulate nick our street marshal but when return to castle green with he it be clear that the antisocial behaviour problem there have become intractable therefore suggest that we need to work with somerset council to get public space protection order and hope the government will support its enforcement too many of our great community event be mar by the antisocial few and we need to tackle that we need the public space of castle green with its superb independent market our famous castle hotel the schedule ancient monument which be the castle itself and the museum of somerset where soon people will be able to see the chew valley hoard of silver coin from the norman conquest can not use those coin to pay for the enforcement of the public space protection order but hope it will have government support so that we can ensure that key public space be not subject to conquest by those who would disobey the law wreak havoc among local people damage livelihood and tarnish the generally superb reputation of our county town promise my constituent more police officer in stockton billingham and norton and we be deliver on that promise crackdown on antisocial behaviour on the high street and we be deliver on that promise name police officer in every neighbourhood and we be deliver on that this be serious government roll up their sleeve and get on with deliver on the issue that matter most to the people to teesside have visit corner shop pick up the piece after be attack by balaclava clothe thug have speak to union and retail worker about the devastating impact of shoplifting theft and assault on shop worker our high street should be thrive but too often they be overshadow by antisocial behaviour that keep family away crime erode confidence in our community leave people feel unsafe in their neighbourhood and make it hard for business to thrive and nowhere be this more obvious than in the illegal use of off road bike for too long these bike have be menace as they maraud through estate intimidate resident and be use by criminal to evade police people have have enough promise to come down hard on crime increase police number and make our high street and community safe and that be exactly what we be do with million invest in neighbourhood policing cleveland police under our labour police and crime commissioner matt storey be deliver on that promise with new officer on our street increase the visible police presence in our community they be use new tactic to stop crime in its track deploy police drone to track off road bike in real time if criminal think they can evade justice they be wrong their bike will be track seize and take off our street my hon friend be give an excellent speech about the challenge we face on teesside just today hear from james in easterside who say that in two hour there be not minute when an illegal off road bike quad or scooter do not pass do my hon friend agree that we need to seize such bike crush they and make our street safe again be sure that james in easterside will be pleased to learn that cleveland police have seize vehicle link to crime and dangerous driving since january alone which be already make big difference crime across cleveland be now at its low level in five year follow more than reduction which mean nearly few victim of crime this be what proactive police and crime commissioner labour member of parliament and labour government work together look like we be put police back at the heart of our community and ensure that they have the necessary power and the backing of justice system that actually work we be introduce respect order to tackle the bad antisocial behaviour offender and stamp out issue such as public drinking and drug use to ensure that our town centre be free from harm and nuisance new offence such as child criminal exploitation and cuckooing will crack down on drug dealing we will protect our high street by end the effective immunity for anyone catch shoplift good worth below and introduce new criminal offence to well protect retail worker from assault stockton billingham and norton deserve safe street and we be deliver it should be clear to my resident that this government and as their mp be on the side of law and order although we be see green shoot of progress there be still much more to do to reclaim our street and town centre the job be not do yet but we be make real progress together we will take back our street and ensure that our town be place of pride today legislation contain welcome provision to address some of the behaviour that plague my constituent which be allow to flourish under the previous conservative government my constituent will welcome serious and renew focus on combat shoplifting and antisocial behaviour because the conservatives decimate our police community support officer in surrey they fall by between and and erode the close relationship between the police and the community they serve ultimately the provision in this bill that be intend to make place such as esher and walton safe must be back by genuine and sustained commitment to community policing and by give officer the time and resource to build trust and understanding with those they protect in the past month arrest make by surrey police for shop theft have more than double this be not merely case of officer solve high percentage of crime in fact the number of theft detect by the police have also more than double surge level of shoplifting be utterly corrosive for high street in place such as esher and walton they impose cost on retailer and may undercut resident faith in law enforcement and the ability of politician to get thing do so hope the government will pursue this issue with urgency the same be true when antisocial behaviour be not deal with have receive far too many email and letter from constituent struggle with the conduct of neighbour in such case the action of few can impose severe strain on so many as one constituent write to there be an issue of fairness ordinary people come for quiet life have work to do and have be leave exhaust by noise disruption and even threaten behaviour come from small group recognise that this bill accordingly highlight housing provider as relevant agency with role to play in tackle antisocial behaviour however when people feel threaten there be no substitute for recognisable neighbourhood police with deep link to the community give the criminal sanction attach to breach of respect order can the minister assure the house that community police will receive funding in line with the vital role they have to play in ensure that the government new order do not become meaningless finally will address the protection of police officer the police deserve protection from abuse the public order act be enhance in to allow racially and religiously motivate abusive language or behaviour that be direct at emergency worker to be treat as an aggravating factor however there be loophole in the legislation such that if this particular form of abuse occur when both party be in the perpetrator private dwelling it be not treat as an aggravating factor that be wrong it leave the mistaken impression that there be some circumstance in which the racial abuse of emergency worker be acceptable and it fail to deter such behaviour will the minister therefore commit to re examine that issue and explore the possibility of finally remove the anomaly have share before with the house that use to be police officer and work for three force across england and wales that have give strong understanding of the challenge face by both officer and the public in tackle crime it be partly due to this experience that fully support the bill and the government commitment to make our community safe in my constituency of the forest of dean crime and antisocial behaviour have direct impact on family business and community it be crucial that our police force have the right power support and resource to tackle these issue effectively the bill empower our officer give they the tool and the confidence that they need to make swift decision and restore public trust those be thing wish have have more of when be serve the bill also address persistent antisocial behaviour with the introduction of the respect order which will help restore order and send strong message to offender it strengthen measure against theft allow police to enter property without warrant to search for steal good that have tracker on they another key aspect of the bill be its focus on domestic abuse in gloucestershire as whole third of all arrest make in january relate to domestic abuse and think we would all agree that this be unacceptable the bill include crucial provision to support victim and improve the management of such offender which be vital for both victim and law enforcement another important factor for be that the bill focus on tackle child sexual abuse by introduce the mandatory duty to report it will ensure that no case be overlook have work in the police but also in school have see at first hand how important it be to act quickly when it come to protect child from sexual exploitation another mantra of mine which hope be reflect in the bill be that prevention be always well than detection that apply to any crime but it be especially true of this hideous one of child sexual exploitation the duty to report will help ensure that child be less vulnerable finally urge all member to support the bill it will not only empower our police but support victim take strong action against those who endanger our constituent safety and that of our child and drive real change in our street it be pleasure to speak in this debate and thank all right hon and hon member for their contribution on the whole the bill be to be welcome number of the provision be already in place in northern ireland such as the offensive weapon penalty and there be other that the northern ireland executive be in the process of introduce in my intervention on the home secretary welcome the clause that require consent motion because they be the sort of provision that we want in northern ireland as well on the thing that be outstanding the home secretary kindly say that she would through the minister and the assembly take they far so that be also good news there be other measure that agree with and some that believe do not go far enough such as the provision on policing and investigation think of the absolutely heartbreaking interview with david amess daughter about the refusal to carry out public inquiry into her father murder by an isis supporter david amess be my friend as he be to many in this house and we be the poor for his passing with all due respect believe that the decision not to carry out an inquiry be the wrong decision hope this bill and perhaps the clause on investigation in part may lead to further power be available for family to seek an inquiry into why the police have cease their investigation david amess family deserve that inquiry and this house deserve that inquiry but will leave it at that welcome the shoplifting provision and very much welcome those on knife crime which have be scourge across this great nation and the government have accept the need for such legislation wish the tightening of the provision on child sexual exploitation be not necessary but it certainly be between and record crime relate to child pornography be up by which be shocking figure as father and grandfather such statistic upset but as parliamentarian such statistic galvanise to ensure that we shut down this horrific industry include by jail all those involve in share video or produce they none of those crime be victimless and we must take stride to address that consequently welcome those provision no bill can ever be perfect and there be amendment to be make but it be clear that our system currently allow too many criminal to slip through loophole and the police need great power of investigation and of drug testing as well security must however be balance with and the bill should not impinge on the exist right of british citizen the right to protest be vital mechanism for freedom of speech but it must be safe protest speak as someone who have protest for nearly all my life and we have live in nation and country where protest become the name of the game have to say that those be always peaceful protest underline that very quickly but balance must be strike look forward to the minister outline how we can protect our freedom in this bill such as the right to have religious belief and to express it in balanced way and not be persecute or discriminate against for that reason we also need protection for our service personnel include by provide support in relation to the vexatious allegation that we be see in northern ireland we will not recruit police service or armed force personnel if they know they will be abandon and hang out to dry at the first hint of an allegation the bill must strengthen that protection that be one of the thing look forward to try to do there be much in the bill that we should welcome and the home secretary and the government be definitely on the right road we will also see difference in northern ireland and the bill be good news for everyone in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland enormously welcome this bill in which there be so much that will make real positive difference for my constituent in north west cambridgeshire due to time constraint will have to skip through lot of the praise have for the bill and move straight to an area where would like to have conversation and dialogue with the minister about what we can do and that be the area of mandatory reporting enormously welcome the fact that this bill will finally introduce statutory duty to report the possible sexual abuse of child when those who have responsibility for child be make aware of it it have be long road in march the previous conservative government say the case for mandatory reporting have not currently be make and that they would not introduce the policy the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse chair by alexis jay show how misjudged that position be thank my hon friend for support in my debate last week on professor jay recommendation for the church of england do he agree with that alongside the government implement those recommendation it be critical that faith organisation implement they as well absolutely agree with my hon friend and thank he for that intervention as society we must move towards ensure that child be protect when it come to the detail be not fully sure that the bill as currently draft deliver on the government pledge to implement the iicsa recommendation that be mainly because on my reading it do not create criminal sanction for non compliance which be key part of the iicsa recommendation the only consequence spell out in the bill for failure to report be that someone could be refer to as their professional regulator where relevant or to the disclosure and barring service which to quote the bill explanatory note will consider their suitability to continue work in regulated activity with child that be all really positive but we have to go little bit far as currently draft be the bill enough to tackle the chronic under reporting of sexual abuse identify by the jay inquiry the new offence of stop someone else from report child sexual abuse be very welcome for example it should stop manager pressure people who work under they not to report such abuse but do not think that it will cover such case in religious group as an example would like to talk about the religious organisation in which be raise the jehovah witness most people know very little about they but they be very insular religious community with deep distrust in many case of secular authority much of which come from the fundamental nature of some of their belief witness have mindset in which the first port of call for any issue with another member of the faith be their local congregation body of religious elder who be man always man appoint from within their rank the organisation deny that it stop these elder from refer allegation of sexual abuse to the police but number speak louder than word almost year ago the jehovah witness be one of the case study examine by an australian royal commission on institutional response to child sexual abuse the commission find that in australia alone allegation have be document by religious elder against individual and not single one be report to the police in the uk elder sometimes say that it be victim absolute right to go to the police which be often the organisation response to such criticism but behind the scene they heavily discourage it tell victim that publicity would bring reproach on god name this secretive attitude be well exemplified by recent speech by member of the religion govern body suppose that someone be convict and put in jail or someone be find guilty by man as jesus be it do not mean that he be guilty in the sight of god should flag that he be not specifically refer to child sexual abuse but that attitude be pervasive describe this example to highlight just how critical it be that the duty to report be back up by criminal consequence for ignore it because some of these organisation will do anything to avoid compliance be the minister willing to meet to discuss this issue in more depth and how we can address it would also appreciate it if she could comment on the scope of the individual that the bill place under duty to report be not convince at the moment that many religious leader who often hold very significant power and influence as have outline will be include this go back to the iicsa report which recommend that the duty to report should fall on anyone who work in regulated activity but also on anyone in position of trust over child as define by the sexual offences act on my reading the bill do the former but not the latter as currently draft and address this by use both criterion could significantly strengthen the legislation welcome this bill which contain very powerful provision to progress measure outline in the manifesto on which labour members stand to make our street safe and tackle crime look forward to vote for it this evening rise to support this bill which will provide the necessary tool to restore public confidence in law and order as former warrant police officer council portfolio holder for enforcement and chair of medway community safety partnership have be work with and within my community to challenge many of the issue that this bill will counter thank kent police and kent county council staff for all the work they do every weekend every day and every hour to help and support our resident however this bill do not come without context for over decade the previous government chip away at our criminal justice system they cut police funding we all remember the police federation cut have consequences campaign and the previous government slash officer number before recruit more officer to low level per capita they slash pcso number and weaken council enforcement team court delay skyrocket probation be privatised then nationalise and then privatise again legal aid be gutte prison be leave full these reckless act have fuel antisocial behaviour and shatter public confidence in law enforcement do my hon friend share my shock that cumbria police do not hand out single penalty notice for disorder in that be down from issue in do he also share my enthusiasm for this bill measure to introduce respect order could not concur more police funding and police officer number have result in few fine be issue for many type of crime in fact the bill will give the police more power to challenge nuisance biking and other offence the bill be an absolutely necessary first step on saturday visit quite few retailer in wokingham there be no police presence at all in the town despite crime occur hourly in our shop someone be always shoplift thames valley police have only police officer per people which be well below the national average of do the hon gentleman agree that be not enough agree that insufficient police number in recent year result in shoplifter charter under the last government when people be allow to shoplift up to set amount thank my hon friend the member for tipton and wednesbury antonia bance for her westminster hall debate last week and thank my hon friend the member for north durham luke akehurst for his ten minute rule bill on nuisance biking the number of reckless biker and boy racer who tear through our street and churn up our park have significantly increase in previous year under the previous government the weak section of the police reform act effectively allow these biker to get away with slap on the wrist welcome the measure in this bill that will allow these vehicle to be seize which will send message that those who be catch with these vehicle will lose that asset immediately kent police call for these power when go on an operation in november and witness the cat and mouse tactic of perpetrator and the resource need to impose these extremely weak penalty knife crime have surge since and disproportionately affect young people the bill give the police new stop and search power in high crime area allow law enforcement to be much more proactive in intercept potential threat welcome this measure specifically in area of high knife crime in the urban centre of chatham and aylesford the digital age have produce new avenue for crime as many colleague have mention that include child sexual exploitation as well as exploitation and violence against woman the bill will introduce more power to challenge stalker and strengthen protection against child sexual exploitation be former teacher and have to look at safeguard case involve online activity on weekly basis without these additional power it will be increasingly difficult to catch the malign influence that be harm our young people believe that the bill will also enhance police transparency and accountability it improve police training focus on de escalation technique and mental health awareness it equip officer with the skill necessary to handle wide range of situation with sensitivity and professionalism we know police officer do this every day but we also know that the diversity of challenge they face require new training as colleague have say so eloquently domestic violence be often hidden crime that leave victim feel trap and powerless to escape the bill strengthen the legal framework for protect victim by introduce new provision for protective order include the ability to ban perpetrator from return to victim home even before their trial it also mandate well support for victim offer increase access to legal and social service this bill be not just about law it be about life safe street protect community and justice that truly serve the people it represent forward thinking balanced approach to law and order and public safety it provide our police with the power they need to combat crime support our justice system to deliver fair and effective sentence promote great community engagement and most importantly ensure that victim of crime and our community receive the care and protection they deserve be pleased to support the bill which will be welcome in urban and rural community across

embolden criminality that must be stop such activity be not just blot on company balance sheet it punish good faith customer and demoralise the worker who take pride in the work that they do that be why welcome the repeal of section of the anti social behaviour crime and policing act to finally call time on britain open invitation to criminal to steal good worth or less secondly want to touch on the grow occurrence of abuse and the threat of violence face by too many shop worker in their workplace in survey of usdaw member more than two third of retail worker reveal they have be verbally abuse almost half have be threaten and one in five have be physically assault while do their job that be clearly totally intolerable nobody in this country should go to work fear for their own physical safety believe that we in this house with our security guard and our armed police have particular duty to ensure that those who work in our shop feel just as safe as we do will the hon gentleman give way will not just because there be so little time and too many people want to speak that be why the bill introduction of the new offence of assault retail worker be so important it be

deliver where the conservatives fail this be bill that take crime seriously it be bill to rebuild public confidence make our street safe and give our police the power support and resource they need to protect our community the page of the bill make satisfying reading for this former crown prosecutor satisfy because know it be pack full of measure that will make the street safe for my constituent amber valley be brilliant place to live but sadly it be not without incident of antisocial behaviour that be an important issue to my constituent which be why will focus what little time have this evening on part of the bill have hear the concern of resident in our town and village about car and off road bike be drive in an antisocial manner have listen to the frustration of police officer who explain to how they be hamstrung unable to do anything but issue warning the labour control borough council have make good use of the public space protection order available to it include by issue fine for car cruise across amber valley and disperse troublemaker in heanor marketplace the bill will mean that troublemaker can be disperse for long and that the police will finally have the power to immediately seize and crush their car and bike give resident confidence that the police will at long last have the tool they need to crack down on such antisocial behaviour antisocial behaviour come in many form and be often legacy of tory austerity youth provision have be drastically cut back by conservative control derbyshire county council youth service be crucial pillar in amber valley link young people with the wide community and the neighbourhood police as see recently at the railway carriage in ironville this environment help to steer young people away from choose crime this labour government understand that we need to give our young people chance which be why alongside the bill we be work at pace towards our opportunity mission provide more apprenticeship and skilled job for our young people we know that antisocial behaviour be often commit by small number of repeat offender young and old alike the bill will make it possible for individual who persistently commit antisocial behaviour to be make subject to respect order without wait for they to be convict of criminal offence thus speed up the response not least because it will avoid the huge backlog in the crown court that we inherit from the tories we must not forget that people who repeatedly act in an antisocial manner often have underlying issue or trauma drive their behaviour whether with alcohol awareness class for those who persistently drink and be aggressive in our park or drug treatment order for those who steal to fund their habit these tough new order will tackle the root cause of such behaviour the additional police officer and respect order be central to our safe street mission but the order will work only if the resource be available to support offender to deal with their issue and change their behaviour and urge the government to ensure that such provision be in place antisocial behaviour be often describe as low level crime but it do not feel low level to the people who have to endure it the people of amber valley can be confident that this government have act on their concern and that the antisocial behaviour will be stop wholeheartedly support the bill speak in full support of the bill which be crucial piece of legislation that will help to deliver on the government safe street mission be incredibly proud to stand on platform of secure the safety of my constituent it be the first responsibility of any government to keep their community safe whether nationally or internationally our community deserve safety security and respect too often antisocial behaviour violent crime and lawlessness undermine the very fabric of our society have see that recently in wildwood and highfields and western downs in my constituency of stafford eccleshall and the village where confidence in public service have be erode by antisocial behaviour the bill take decisive action to restore public confidence in police and protect those most vulnerable to crime the bill strengthen police power to tackle persistent offender introduce respect order to hold perpetrator accountable and remove the bureaucratic barrier that delay much need enforcement whether it be vandalism or the reckless use of vehicle our response must be swift and effective furthermore we can not discuss crime prevention without address our duty to young people too many of our youth be draw into criminal activity whether through exploitation gang violence or knife crime blame be often put in the wrong place we need to tackle the adult who exploit those young people the bill introduce tough measure to combat child criminal exploitation ensure that those who manipulate and abuse young people face the full force of the law at the same time we must invest in preventive measure education youth service and intervention programme that divert young people away from crime and towards opportunity in my professional career work with child and young people and know how amazing they be when they be give chance the government will make sure that no child be leave behind another key pillar of the bill be community police our police officer do an extraordinary job under immense pressure yet public confidence have erode the bill equip our police with the tool they need great power to tackle serious crime retail theft and violent offender while ensure robust accountability by support our frontline officer we send clear message that law and order remain at the heart of our national priority be particularly pleased to see the name police officer guarantee as my constituent in rural village and settlement often tell that they struggle to feel connected to the police with long wait for their call and lack of oversight or regular patrol in their area that be why recently ask the home office in oral question whether rural community such as tyrley in my constituency would receive the name police officer guarantee be delighted that the policing minister confirm that they would the government be commit to deliver the safety for rural community that we so desperately need the bill protect victim punish criminal and strengthen the foundation of safe society it ensure that our high street our town and village and our home be protect from those who seek to harm or exploit urge hon member to support it in deliver justice security and respect for all speak in support of the bill not just because it be the big package of measure on crime and police for decade with new law to cut crime and make our street safe but because those new measure will tackle antisocial behaviour shop theft and street crime head on by give the police and our community new power to take back town and city centre such as newport from thug and thief those be great reason to welcome the bill but also welcome it because it contain some of my own work last year introduce my first private member bill to the house the community and suspend sentences notification of details bill which seek to amend the sentencing code to create duty on offender to notify the responsible officer of any change of name or contact detail if they be sentence to community order suspend sentence order youth rehabilitation order or referral order too often at the moment such offender be able to change their name and slip under the radar to avoid scrutiny and potentially go on to reoffend chapter of part of the bill mean that my private member bill have be note and incorporate into the legislation be pleased that the government be commit to utilise good idea from all area include the back benches do not wish to praise only the element of the bill that contribute to because it will seek to address some other serious issue particularly welcome the introduction of respect order to stamp out issue such as public drinking and drug use that will be particularly welcome in cross keys in my constituency where resident life be blight by such antisocial behaviour outside their home and along the canal natural beauty spot that be also suffer from individual drink and take drug during the day in full view of passersby another issue that affect my constituent be off road biking which be dangerous and cause great deal of damage to our beautiful countryside welcome the police new power as result of the bill to seize vehicle and to stop off road biking and the dangerous use of scooter on pavement remove the need for police to issue warning before seize off road bike and scooter be particularly welcome and great news for the people of argoed and those live near mynydd maen in my constituency must also mention the need to protect shop worker because shop staff be particularly targeted and vulnerable group in introduce the new offence of assault retail worker the government be show that they be serious about tackle issue in community to take back our shop and street by confront violence and antisocial behaviour head on as chair of the all party parliamentary group on safeguarding in faith community be also pleased to see new duty in england for adult work in relevant activity to report instance of child sexual abuse as already mention the government be work hard to implement the recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse after year of inaction by the previous government finally be also pleased to see the new offence for spiking which be predominantly an offence commit by man against woman violence against woman and girl be endemic in our society and we need to take it seriously and tackle it directly be sad to say that that have not always be the case there have be some solid campaign such as stoptopps but place the emphasis on the potential victim can not solve the issue the bill make difference and thank the front bench team for their diligence in bring it forward could go on but be mindful of time and the need to get other speaker in so close by welcome the bill and urge all those involve to get it through the necessary stage and on to the statute book as quickly as possible on friday attend an event organise by age uk mid mersey at the mansion house in windle in my constituency take question from service user and volunteer it be no surprise to that crime and policing and specifically the threat of antisocial behaviour be raise by those present old people tell that they be scared to leave their home especially after dark for their sake and for all those in our community we need to take our street back the bill be step towards do that many of the bill welcome measure be aim at tackle what for too long and by too many have be think of as low level crime antisocial behaviour whether public drinking drug use vandalism or off road bike tear up sport pitch and park be completely unacceptable it blight our community and can ruin life people in st helens north have great pride in where they live but that have be test too often by mindless minority in recent week in blackbrook have hear report of some young people target bus and shop with object even cause some bus to be divert they be minority and know most young people will be just as appal by that sort of behaviour as most people of any age but it be totally unacceptable the introduction of respect order will help to address some of that by target repeat offender and ensure that they face real consequence most of all restore neighbourhood policing will send message that we will not stand for it another crime that for too long have be see as low level and have be effectively decriminalised be shoplift my mum be shop worker work in what be then the co op on west end road in blackbrook she regularly encounter shoplifting and be sad to say much bad she be assault at work as be many other woman she work with when it come to violence against shop worker we need the police and business to take every possible step to protect worker and customer and to punish those responsible strongly welcome the proposal in the bill people in st helens north deserve and demand to feel safe the bill contain many step in the right direction to ensure that crime do not dictate the way that we live our life and that those responsible face the consequence of their irresponsible action our police must have the resource and the power to tackle antisocial behaviour and violent crime both prevention and punishment it be about protect our community and ensure that they be place to live work and raise family in peace that be all most of we want and we need to deliver it rise to support the bill much of which be fulfil labour mission to make our street safe by deal with what sometimes be call low level criminality but in reality be crime that make people feel unsafe in their own community whether shoplifting public drug and alcohol abuse online harm or antisocial behaviour law breaking must always be deal with and never ignore warmly acknowledge in particular the propose change to the law on retail crime sadly law breaking be commonplace in retail many year ago when be student work at clothing shop in the centre of glasgow my colleague and have to deal with threat intimidation and even the prospect of be stab with needle have see at first hand how that kind of intimidation can affect people in their work environment go to the co op in morpeth in my constituency recently where hear from usdaw colleague and co op staff that the situation face retail worker have only become bad with worker at time face industrial level of shoplifting and threat of physical harm that be why welcome the removal of the tories de facto floor on shoplifting prosecution as well as the new offence of assault retail worker as hon member have say no one should have to fear for their safety in order to make living however would welcome assurance from the minister about some of the process outline for the new respect order the bill define antisocial behaviour as conduct that have cause or be likely to cause harassment alarm or distress to any person run homelessness charity and can envisage possible scenario in which tenant with the potential to be troublesome be issue with respect order that would bar they from enter the tower block in which they live let we imagine that they do not have alternative accommodation so they enter the flat anyway upon do so they could be arrest charge put on trial and issue with prison term this hypothetical tenant may not be saint but it would be surreal outcome in which criminal be make out of someone who be simply try to go home would appreciate some alleviation of my concern on this matter stick with antisocial behaviour also know from my time work in homelessness that alongside law and order we need other tool to help those with multiple and complex need northumbria university research report that commission in demonstrate that of those face homelessness have experience serious trauma during their life that trauma underlie the often chaotic and unpleasant behaviour that we see in our town and city some of those who be cause misery to other be themselves deeply traumatise by the abuse violence and neglect that they have experience or continue to experience we should remember that be homeless itself be trauma we can most successfully address that behaviour by take trauma inform approach and by offer appropriate support service it be not about be soft crime be crime but if we genuinely want to stop the cycle of offend we need multiple option at our disposal include supportive option when we witness antisocial behaviour we should of course firmly say you must not do that or there will be consequence but we should also ask what happen to you that lead you to this point in your life even as we pursue much need focus on antisocial behaviour and crime would welcome clarification that traumatise people who be often stick in loop of fail system will receive the support that they need the bill will do lot of good and be sure that

ensure the safety and security of our community be one of the most fundamental duty of government when that duty be neglect the consequence be real widespread and deeply feel by everyone especially the most vulnerable in our society in recent year that neglect have reach the point where local authority such as doncaster city council have have to step in to take up the slack recognise the work it have do which have include fund additional police and expand cctv network to support the police in their work from walkaround with the police councillor and business in area such as thorne know the impact that rampant crime be have on our high street and town centre shop owner and worker feel under constant fear of attack that be wrong that be not good enough for the people of thorne not good

long way off have hear from farmer in hatfield about the attack on animal that they have suffer from recently the new power in the bill to track steal farm equipment will help both to deter criminal

debate in contrast to the opposition how seriously the government and the labour party take law and order absolutely agree with all those speech but because of time will focus on violence against woman and girl woman in milton keynes be scared of go out scar of go to the police and scared of go home which be still the most dangerous place for woman violence against woman and girl slowly become consequence free under the previous government under the conservatives only to of report rape ever make it to trial conviction for domestic abuse halve under the conservatives and femicide of which

despite the conservative police and crime commissioner want to talk about stalk and how important our measure be on that if have have time would have share my own story of how be stalk my stalking happen in person but more and more of it be happen online be interested in hear from the minister about how the bill will help to tackle that spike unfortunately continue to rise just two week ago young woman in my constituency approach after be spike at slug and lettuce on her birthday she end up in hospital we have talk lot about measure to protect woman from be spiked but what be we do to tackle the availability of the drug use in spike finally want to talk about be online hon member on the science innovation and technology committee will have hear the weak and disappointing answer from representative of the major social medium firm which be use the umbrella of freedom of speech to allow threat to woman in online space to continue they be also use that to spread pretty radical pornography want to understand how the bill will fit with the cross government plan to tackle violence against woman and girl in my last few second will highlight two law that be still on the statute book that would like the bill to repeal the abortion act which be raise by my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi and the vagrancy act both of they target the most vulnerable in our society and should be repeal crime and antisocial behaviour affect the whole community in which they take place they erode social cohesion trust and pride in place drive people away from our town centre and make they feel insecure in their own street and workplace and even in their own home be therefore pleased to speak in support of the crime and policing bill which be the large package of measure on crime and police for decade crime and antisocial behaviour increase under the previous government despite what the shadow home secretary say the reality be know by my constituent in the year end september the home office record the high ever increase in shoplifting offence usdaw find that one in five shop worker have be physically assault in year instance of theft from person increase by in my community of uxbridge and south ruislip have hear from many constituent who be worried about rise level of crime knife crime shoplifting burglary phone theft and car theft to name but few on sunday alone constituent write to to share their concern about burglary in south ruislip the news be deeply distress to my constituent many of whom feel unsafe in their own home and believe that the police do not have the resource need to protect they that simply can not go on increase in antisocial behaviour be symptom of society in distress far too often it be dismiss by the last government as low level crime they be unwilling and unable to act welcome the measure in the bill to introduce respect order on the bad offender ban persistent offender from our town centre that be welcome news for many of my constituent who have contact about such activity in uxbridge town centre and yiewsley high street critically the bill will also keep my constituent safe and protect they from armed burglary it will create new power for the police to seize retain and destroy bladed article and create new criminal offence of possess bladed article with the intent to cause harm it will also ban the possession and distribution of electronic device which be far too often use in vehicle theft and create new target power for the police to enter premise and search and seize electronically track steal good from mobile phone to steal vehicle end the terrible situation that my constituent have report where they can track their steal phone or electronic item but the police be unable to go in and get it hope too that we will look at international vehicle crime and tough measure at our port to stop the rapid removal from the country of steal vehicle as well as tough law the police must also have the resource they need to apply they and return to proactive neighbourhood policing although the uplift in police funding include to london police force in the last year be incredibly welcome significant pressure on london policing remain so hope we can continue in this parliament to increase the resource of the metropolitan police unfortunately my predecessor while mayor of london close number of police station and police counter welcome the present mayor of london commitment to keep uxbridge police station open and hope we can work together to reopen the front counter and the custody suite strongly support this bill and the new measure and increase police power along with the uplift in funding already agree by this new government these measure will help to restore trust in the police and improve the safety of my constituent and wholeheartedly support they this bill present an opportunity to confront the challenge face our community protect the most vulnerable and ensure that justice serve everyone welcome the government commitment to tackle violence against woman and girl to tackle antisocial behaviour and to halve knife crime this be positive step forward strengthen protection for the public and address some of the damaging policy of the previous government must therefore turn my attention to the impact of the police crime sentencing and courts act in its rush to extend police power this legislation have have devastating effect on gypsy and traveller community the act introduce new criminal offence relate to trespass and grant sweeping power to ban those community from area for up to month as well as power to fine arrest imprison and seize the home of gypsies and travellers under these provision sanction can be enforce base on damage disruption or distress often root in subjective perception of harm this mean that entire community could face eviction or banishment from area with little regard for the cultural context or the lack of alternative place to settle these measure be grave injustice and an affront to the right and dignity of those who follow century old way of life it be concern that in the suppose pursuit of law and order the previous government overlook fundamental human right protection must stress that the impact of these measure be not theoretical it be real and it be be live it be affect family child and entire community human right body have raise their concern the united nations committee on the elimination of racial discrimination in its formal recommendation have call for the repeal of the provision in question and importantly the high court in its ruling in find that certain provision in the act be incompatible with the european convention on human right this parliament have duty to address these human right violation and to correct the injustice do the crime and policing bill offer we the opportunity to right the wrong of the past to restore fairness and to ensure that we have law that respect the right of all people regardless of their heritage or way of life this bill could be the mean by which we address the discrimination face by gypsies and travellers we need bold action to ensure that their tradition be protect all people and all community have the right to fair treatment if we really want to stand for justice and human dignity that must apply to all so as chair of the all party parliamentary group for gypsies travellers and roma urge the government to undo the harm of the previous legislation let we stand for equality under the law and protection for all who live in the united kingdom declare an interest as member and former employee of the union of shop distributive and allied workers welcome the bill bring forward by the government want to discuss three broad area antisocial behaviour retail crime and measure to end commercial sexual exploitation antisocial behaviour have be an increase concern for my constituent in edinburgh north and leith over the past few month they have relay to their concern over group of young people who have be dub the baby gang their name might not seem threaten but their action be the action of the baby gang have alarm my constituent and make they afraid the tragedy be that many of the gang member be only in their mid teen during the general election campaign constituent tell repeatedly how they be feed up with off road bike be use in park and on pavement that be why be so pleased to see that the bill will include provision to tackle not only antisocial behaviour but the use of off road motorbike use in this manner these issue be devolve to the scottish parliament so hope that the scottish government although they be not represent here tonight will look closely at these measure on retail crime congratulate the government on the measure in the bill to tackle the unacceptable attack and assault on shop worker the provision in part of the bill replicate legislation that have already be bring forward by member of the scottish parliament my colleague daniel johnson msp when he secure the protection of workers retail and age restrict goods and services scotland act we be begin to see the positive impact of the legislation and the effect it have have in shop and supermarket across scotland which be evidence in the datum in usdaw late freedom from fear research of shop worker across the uk report abuse report be threaten and report be assault the datum from scotland be low demonstrate that within only few year the introduction of specific crime be help to create safe working environment for shop worker be proud that this bill will extend this protection because protection at work should not be limit by postcode the bill have no specific measure to reduce prostitution or sex trafficking in the home affairs committee find that legislation be need in this area as report from the inquiry on human trafficking find that the collaboration between the national crime agency and the home office on pimp website have produce no evidence of improvement believe that the bill should go far in tackle this exploitation it could afford the government the opportunity to take the action require to reduce demand and to tackle pimp website would be grateful to hear from the minister whether the government would look favourably on amendment that seek to make profiting from the prostitution of another person criminal offence this bill will go long way in reduce crime and hope that when we next consider it in this place it will contain measure that reduce the commercial exploitation of woman antisocial behaviour ruin life on friday hold an event at the field lane estate in calder valley the first in series of event across my constituency to listen to member of the community about antisocial behaviour and their story be heartbreaking family be be terrorise by problem resident child be scared to go to school and resident fear for their property and personal safety all the while people have no trust that make report to the police will bring an end to the fear their family be face sadly this lack of trust become all too common feature in community under the last government they know that no matter how many report they make or how much evidence they have the police will either not turn up or turn up late and then not take people seriously after the last government hollow out our policing service do my hon friend agree that it be vital for member from the previous government to be here to listen to the testimony of our constituent about how the last government fail they on so many facet of tackle crime absolutely agree that the last government fail people on tackle crime particularly due to its hollowing out of the police indeed in west yorkshire alone within just six year of the conservatives take office over police officer have be let go and of those be in frontline role leave their number even more deplete than the opposition benches when the number rise back again it be just not the same because the previous government fail to recognise that police be more than just number on spreadsheet they get rid of officer who know their community who add local intelligence and understanding of the local nuance and who have experience support those neighbourhood we lose the heart of neighbourhood base policing the good tool to combat antisocial behaviour and one of the good reassurance that evidence can have the lack of local knowledge be why we have see over report of antisocial behaviour in calder valley in three year ruin life the lack of trust in police be why know that so many more incident simply go unreported after year of the last conservative government allow antisocial behaviour and other crime to grow unchecked be proud that this labour government be restore respect for law and order stand with and bring community and police close together with name officer in every community back by million of funding to kickstart recruitment for the new neighbourhood police officer the government will end the impunity that criminal feel they can operate under by give officer strong power to tackle antisocial behaviour violent crime and persistent offender who make people live misery against backdrop of the lack of trust in our police service that be allow to fester over year this bill be an important step in the process of rebuild trust and confidence and why on behalf of my constituent from calder valley who have suffer because of antisocial behaviour be back the bill to take action today in ashton orrell platt bridge hindley and hindley green one issue dominate life for so many antisocial behaviour for month have be promise my constituent the measure in the bill and thank the home office team for the hard work require to bring it to the house so quickly to my mind the bill be one of the strong example of this labour government deliver for work people on the issue they care about the bill take tough action against serious crime drug knife crime and terrorism but want to talk about different more everyday type of crime these be the crime that make life demoralise and sometimes frightening for many people and that shape how people feel about their town centre community and security it be the fly tipping in bickershaw that make parent stop their kid play outside it be teenager throw mud at car in hindley and group intimidate people by the shop in winstanley some of the tough call have receive in this job have be people ring to tell that thug have

represent learn to become wigan warriors or the elderly play walk football place where people feel pride in their community have support fundraiser to help those club work with local councillor and warrior player to help st jude build fence to keep the bike out but local resident should not have to reach into their already stretch pocket our street should not feel so unsafe that people resort to self protection we be one of the world large economy and great democracy that be why welcome the measure in the bill such as new power to seize bike that wake people up at night as they do to this saturday every time one of those bike tear past in the town centre hold on to my kid that bit tighter the bill matter because it be about stand up for the good hard work people who love their town and want to feel pride in they again it be about what it mean to feel respect for those who we stand by and live near and it show that the labour government will not tolerate those who make other live misery the respect order for example be wisely name because vandalism thuggery and mindless destruction be about lack of respect for our public space and for each other the bill empower group in society police council housing association with restore that respect ask they to say enough be enough and to take control of their community want to make wide point about respect in our society often when be travel on the bus or train someone be play video loudly on their phone without headphone that be not illegal but it be off put because it force whatever that person be do on to everyone else as if they somehow own our share public space it demonstrate lack of respect for our public realm and for those around we in the end the strength of our community and our country depend on the respect and even the love we have for one other that be what resilience be in community over the last year the conservative government have allow that respect to erode too many no long trust that the law will be uphold and apply equally and fairly to everyone and that erode people trust in one another that be why antisocial behaviour be significant it be about treat one another with lack of respect as if we do not care about the thing we have in common only by rebuild and reinveste in our public realm and restore the strength and integrity of institution such as the police will we rebuild that respect and trust the bill take vital step it show that we stand with law abide hard work people it send strong message to those who fail to recognise their responsibility respect must return to our street and this bill will start to make that happen thank my right hon friend the home secretary and the whole ministerial team for bring forward the bill and make significant progress on our mission to make our street safe want to cover three area in which we promise change and we be deliver the first be antisocial behaviour we have hear much about it from across the house today but it continue to blight my town centre hear time and again from constituent in bournemouth west about how unsafe they feel and antisocial behaviour be reportedly turn potential retailer away from the town centre it be not just question of low level inconvenience it be matter of people everyday quality of life and the economic health of our town the rise in street crime and shoplifting and the persistent nuisance have make many people feel that they can not enjoy the place they live in the way they use to have speak to retail worker and boss from the co op and other retailer who have have to deal over and over again with the same people come into their store sweep stock from the shelf and put their staff at risk the conservatives should be ashamed of that record after year our community have be leave vulnerable and an epidemic of crime and antisocial behaviour have be ignore for far too long we be take action where the last government fail to by remove the shoplifting threshold introduce neighbourhood police officer and increase police funding include more for dorset police and introduce respect order which will give police and local authority new power to tackle the bad offender and prevent they from enter our town and district centre like many other also welcome the step in the bill to immediately seize those awful off road bike and dangerous scooter that cause such nuisance in particular up kinson road and leybourne avenue in my constituency student at bishop aldhelm primary school tell this morning that those nuisance bike be destroy our woodland and protect heathland secondly the bill address serious crime and violence such as knife crime we see knife crime far too often in bournemouth less than two week ago there be brutal double stabbing and it be one in long line of horrific attack include three fatality in the past two year welcome the work this government be do to prevent such attack with the creation of new offence but despite the collaborative work of the police the council and local charity also want to see violence reduction unit in my local area the bill be not just about punish offender it also provide much need support for those who want to turn their life around some amazing work be happen in my constituency particularly through changes be make which provide positive outlet for young people encourage the home secretary to look for opportunity to support activity like those and to collaborate with effective charity through the young futures programme finally it be about time that we strengthen law to protect woman and girl just last week hold an event to well understand woman perception of their own safety in the town centre and to highlight the way in which policing the council business and design can contribute to it welcome the creation of new spiking and stalk offence it be shameful that previous government fail to make those change be proud of the bill and the direction that the labour government be take we be not just talk about crime but take decisive action to reduce it although it may be unrealistic to expect conservative member to take responsibility and apologise for their failure they would have to be in the chamber to do that perhaps they could join my constituent who want to see cross party support for these long overdue change in welcome the bill begin my remark by reflect on the non attendance throughout the debate of reform mp it appear that they spend more time these day litigate against each other than they do legislate in this place when knock on door in crewe and nantwich or sit in my constituency surgery too often meet people who live in perpetual fear in their own community the thing that those people have in common be that they want to see neighbourhood policing restore and be proud that this government be commit to do that anybody with set of eye could see that neighbourhood policing be decimate under the previous government despite what the shadow home secretary say early will the hon member give way will not because be conscious that other wish to get in my constituent also tell that they want to feel as if the police be equip with the power that they need to grip the problem that leave people fearful on the street or bad in their home rise antisocial behaviour have be scourge on our street affect my constituent business their livelihood and

constituent steve tell at my constituency surgery over the weekend that his family life be be make live hell by small number of social housing tenant and the housing provider have so far fail to take any action to address that that be why fully support the introduction of respect order which will allow number of agency include housing provider to place restriction on that kind of behaviour declare an interest start my work life as shop worker first in woolworths yes be old enough and then in bet shop part of the retail sector that have unfortunately never be stranger to violence and intimidation for worker however as find out when meet james the manager of my local co operative store in crewe brazen crime and the intimidation of shop worker have become commonplace even in our local convenience store believe that the bill will make last difference to the life of my constituent business owner worker and decent law abide people just want to live in community where they feel safe these power be ambitious and we must ensure that they deliver real last change for the people who need it most be proud to speak in firm support of the bill many of my constituent feel that crime

and suburban estate such as cotmanhay the bill be about make people feel safe so that erewash resident from sawley to shipley view can live their life free from the fear of crime as our local police force be gutte by austerity under the previous government so call low level offence such as antisocial behaviour shoplifting and even burglary be increasingly ignore and functionally decriminalise by the conservative party shoplifting be functionally decriminalise under the negligence of the previous government who set guideline state that it should not be deal with if good worth less than be steal although major supermarket and survive high street chain might be able to stomach that volume our small business can not how be those business mean to grow how be investment mean to be make how be town centre mean to thrive and how be people mean to feel safe when criminal and thief be give impunity by the previous government shoplifter charter the bill repeal that thieve charter which will surely come as relief to business owner and the hard work law abide majority of constituent in erewash and across the country knife crime have more than double in derbyshire in the past decade the recent horrific stabbing and subsequent death of teenager in my constituency have rightly give rise to lot of anger in my community some of which end up be direct at as people ask bluntly what be you go to do about this that be why will be very proud to vote for the bill which create new offence of possession of bladed item with intent to cause harm it will give our police the new and strong power that they need to seize keep and destroy knife confiscate from private property finally on violence against woman and girl stalk and harassment offence be record in derbyshire in the high figure in the east midland along with more than sexual offence in that time one of my great friend and constituent report to police that she have be follow and have sexual abuse shout at she that abuse happen in broad daylight and in public on west park in long eaton the government mission be to halve violence against woman and girl in decade if we be to do that our police will need the measure in the bill if we have now enter the decade of national renewal that the government promise yes we need to get the economy grow again yes we need to get britain build again and yes we need to get the nhs back on its foot but we must also ensure that crime be punish and that the police be give the power that they need to properly enforce against offender we must take back our street and excise the rot if we restore social order and respect for our community we can fix broken britain warmly welcome the clause in this landmark bill that will give great protection to victim of stalk include guidance for police about disclose the identity of online stalker to victim and clarify what constitute stalk so that the police have no excuse not to pursue incident some of victim survey by the suzy lamplugh trust have suffer from mental health problem as result of be stalk be stalk be also an indicator of be at high risk of domestic homicide it be vital that victim feel safe to report what they be suffer which be why welcome the opening of the purpose build acer house centre for victim of rape and sexual assault in york and north yorkshire it have be design in consultation with victim to provide safe and supportive environment in which evidence can be collect and people can receive immediate health care and medical examination if need accord to women aid stalk by ex partner account for the large group of stalking victim with the vast majority of victim be woman as with domestic abuse in general rate of prosecution and conviction be shockingly low in the year to march north yorkshire police record stalk offence but only result in charge or summon in just over half the original case the victim choose not to pursue the case work by the suzy lamplugh trust help to explain why and argue that victim have be let down at every stage by the police the cps and the court the trust super complaint against the police in find that they be not even identify stalk case and even when they be they often do not properly investigate the trust recommend that stalk protection order should be apply for and put in place at as early stage as possible after year of failure under the tories this bill can not come soon enough for victim of stalk new domestic abuse protection order have be pilot which victim can apply for themselves stalk victim also feel that their life be control by someone else so give they the chance to apply for stalk protection order would hand power back to they be so pleased that the government be consider wide change to stalk protection order and invite the minister to

hartlepool shopping centre on york road know locally as the ramp have be plague by individual who seek to intimidate and disrupt the daily life of decent hard work people be feed up of hear family and

intervention design to tackle the issue head on which the bill enhance and extend one key measure be the use of public space protection order that allow we to prohibit certain behaviour in and around particular geographic area the bill reinforce that tool by increase the maximum fine for violate such an order from to ensure strong deterrent against antisocial behaviour be also push for the great use of enforcement power include dispersal order which the bill extend from hour to hour and community safety accreditation scheme which grant police enforcement power to council shopping centre and

street drinker move in under the last labour government there be six police and community support officer for every single ward in ealing southall but the conservatives cut billion from police in london so we be lucky to have couple of local officer per ward they be not dedicate to the area like they use to be they get pull to brent harrow or central london under the previous labour government the police also have strong power the conservatives actually reduce police power labour have already start the work to bring back neighbourhood policing and to recruit new officer with million of extra funding for police in london we will ensure that police officer get back out on the street instead of do admin work like they be do under the previous government this bill will give those new officer the tough power they need to tackle antisocial behaviour and crime with new law to make our street safe our new respect order will mean that the police can stop street drinker from congregate at hanwell clock tower and stop drug dealer from come into west ealing and southall if people break respect order the police will now be able to arrest they immediately and take they to court where they can face up to two year in prison the police will be able to drug test more people on arrest and respect order will require that drinker and drug user access rehab service to break the cycle of dependency the bill will also give police the power to search property without warrant where they have evidence that there be steal electronic device inside have my own phone steal while back could see on the internet that it be in east london but the police could not do anything about it this law will now mean that police can use find my phone app to go after phone thief and get steal property

borough in the country when it come to issue fix penalty notice against fly tipper but it need help to do more under the conservatives fly tipping be allow to spiral and be see as low level crime but it blight community know that this labour government be look at further step we can take to punish fly tipper and to reduce waste in the first place after year of the conservatives leave local people

government antisocial behaviour have become far too common last year of people report experience antisocial behaviour police power to tackle criminal behaviour have be consistently weaken our community have be leave expose and we have hear many powerful example of that from member across the house today that be why the measure in this bill be so badly need shoplifting casual drug taking reckless driving and neighbourhood intimidation may not seem overly significant on their own but when commit persistently these low level act of antisocial behaviour make our community that bit less safe one crime at time speak to resident on the doorstep in jennett park in great hollands recently hear how spate of car theft be make people lose sleep at night bracknell forest be an incredible place to live with comparatively low crime rate but whether it be drug take in our underpass motorised bike be drive around our footpath or shoplifting target our shop our community be feel the effect of the tories weak response to crime and antisocial behaviour last year shoplift in bracknell and wokingham go up by that be not just in the town centre but across bracknell forest include in sandhurst where one local convenience store have be repeatedly target and their staff threaten have see it myself sit in café of local supermarket with the manager and watching as shoplifter walk out of the shop they be know to the staff but there be little they could do to stop the frequent theft thank thames valley police for the work they be do to tackle this endemic shoplifting and be pleased to say that the precipitous rise be now slow down however the police need the right power in place if they be to get to grip with the problem that be why it be so welcome that the crime and policing bill will introduce tough new respect order to ban repeat offender from antisocial hotspot we be introduce new criminal offence to protect retail worker from abuse thank to the fantastic campaigning

important step in deliver labour safe street mission my hon friend be do great job in explain some of the new power that the bill will give our police police officer in my area to whom have speak find it absurd that it have take until now to do so do my hon friend agree that these measure be such common sense that no reasonable party in the house should vote against they absolutely and it would be great to see more opposition members here to support the measure the power introduce by the bill be indeed welcome but under the last government we see reduction in the use of power that already exist in thames valley police issue more than antisocial behaviour notice penalty notice for disorder but in they issue only which be decrease as have say these new power be an important step in the delivery of labour safe street mission but as well as give police the right power to crack down on antisocial behaviour as my hon friend mention we need to give they the right resource that be why it be so important that this government have increase police funding by more than billion and the budget of thames valley police have be increase by our safe street mission will see additional police officer on britain street along with name contactable officer in each community that will help people to feel safe in their community again the tories introduce chaos on our street and in our

off vandalism be not minor inconvenience it be costly and distressing and leave people feel unsafe in their own community car theft also continue to plague my constituent one resident car have be steal four time and the daughter of another have have she mop steal twice even have to recover it herself on one occasion that be not to mention the number of tradie who be subject to tool theft the bill will empower police force to take property crime more seriously make it easy to track and recover steal vehicle and more importantly ensure that victim of theft receive timely police response the scottish estate in cosham the london road in northend allaway avenue in paulsgrove and tangiers road in baffins be just four of the many place where scooter bike and car race deafeningly and dangerously in my constituency be pleased that the bill remove the need of the police to issue warning before seize vehicle be use antisocially this be the start of real crackdown on vehicle be use to intimidate pedestrian and increasingly commit crime antisocial behaviour be destroy the quality of life for so many people one of my constituent an year old woman have suffer relentless harassment from neighbour her garden have be vandalise furniture have be throw and she have be physically intimidate the bill give the police strong power to tackle antisocial behaviour and strengthen the use of exist antisocial behaviour power the shadow of knife crime hang over my constituency in the past two month alone and even today there have be two stabbing and an attempt murder involve two teenager parent be write to terrify for their child safety and demand action some have even raise concern about the advertising of chef knife on television welcome the fact that this bill provide the police with the power they need to take knife off our street enforce tough penalty for possession and intervene early to prevent young people from be draw into violent crime because knife crime kill finally father have reach out to to say he be deeply concerned about the safety of woman and girl in portsmouth his year old daughter who love run have be catcall and harass multiple time and she have not report it because she believe it would waste police time as we know low level crime against woman can be gateway to more serious crime and welcome the fact that this bill bring in new protection for woman this be not portsmouth specific issue and it be not labour issue which be why it be shocking to see the lack of opposition members in this place today all our constituent deserve to live in safe community and they deserve their mp to make change and put those change into action it be pleasure to speak in support of this vital bill which will see the labour government deliver on the promise make at the last election to return our town centre to our constituent and make our street safe this bill address press issue that have long plague our society and its provision be both timely and necessary particularly on the sexual abuse of child knife crime and economic crime first on child sexual abuse the nspcc have find that over child sexual abuse image crime be record by the police every day that be horrifying statistic and it should focus the mind of all of we in this place which be why support victim and survivor be rightly the cornerstone of this bill very much welcome the step take to ensure that our criminal justice system which be neglect for far too long under previous conservative governments be well equip to handle such case effectively secondly the bill measure on knife crime which have devastate family and community across the country will also safeguard our child be one of the mps for croydon place that continue to pay the price for the previous government inaction on knife crime and youth violence do my hon friend agree that when it come to youth violence we have to focus on prevention and do he welcome the introduction of the young futures programme so that we can prevent young people from get draw into crime in the first place absolutely agree that prevention be fundamental especially when it come to youth crime the senseless killing of seven year old emily jones in queen park bolton in be horrify knife crime incident have be on the rise in town such as bolton for number of year so we owe it to emily and her family and to all those who have be affect by knife crime to take bold action and to take it now to this end be pleased to see that the bill introduce tough sentencing for repeat offender and strengthen the police power to seize dangerous weapon before they be use to cause harm thirdly number of the crime that have detail be enable by economic crime such as money laundering and fraud indeed we hear early from the shadow home secretary about crime statistic what would say to those on the opposition benches be that we have see fraud epidemic over the last few year and case be allow to spiral out of control under previous conservative administrations frankly they be ignore by the shadow home secretary when he be minister indeed april to march see million case of fraud in this of all crime accord to the ons by remove the ability of criminal to launder their ill get gain in the clean economy we can remove the primary incentive for the behaviour that drive so much of the criminal activity that we have be debate tonight indeed have spend almost year tackle economic crime particularly welcome the new provision in the bill to cap court cost for enforcement agency which the conservative party never address too often our law enforcement body face intolerable financial risk when pursue the recovery of ill get gain from deep pocket crook with expensive lawyer one minor mistake by the national crime agency or the serious fraud office can wipe out whole year budget that have have chilling effect on the risk appetite of agency to tackle those suspect of serious and organised crime which drive so much of the criminality that we be debate tonight by introduce cost protection in clause the government be rightly level the play field for enforcement agency and those who be charge this will send powerful message about the rule of law in this country which be that no matter how rich or well connected someone be if they be engage in criminal behaviour justice will be do we be in very challenging place when it come to the public finance and the tax burden bequeath by the conservative party to my constituent be already far too high which bring to specific proposal that would urge the minister to consider as the bill progress through this place economic crime cost we around billion every year yet less than of police resource be dedicate to tackle it so why not make the criminal pay cross governmental economic crime fighting fund would use the reinvested proceed of regulatory and criminal fine asset recovery and defer prosecution agreement to provide sustainable funding and increase firepower for our enforcement agency capability hope the minister will respond to this ask for sustainable and innovative solution in her wind up the bill provide much need shake up for crime and police in this country it will return our street and town centre to our constituent and deliver justice where too often it be deny be very happy to be able to speak and to add my support to this bill and appreciate the depth and ambition of the measure that have be bring forward when meet my local police officer in bristol and south gloucestershire see committed group of man and woman completely dedicated to public service but also see that morale be low police number in avon and somerset have fall with the number of pcso drop from in to today after year of cut officer question if they be appreciate for our police hope that this bill be see as demonstration of the confidence that we have in they and the respect we have for the difficult job they do welcome the step take to let police get on with their job include search premise where phone be geolocate confiscate illegal road bike and introduce respect order as well as lift the cap on when officer will investigate shoplifting there be also the new protection for shop worker such as the woman have meet work in boots in kingswood and the pdsa people dispensary for sick animals charity shop in kingswood which be just two of the shop blight day in and day out by shoplifter on different aspect of the bill we have see the struggle and confusion in relation to police public order at protest protest be cornerstone of our democracy but we have see example of protest that have become hateful have incite violence and have become violent fine for climb on war memorial and ban face covering will help maintain public order and hope the police know that they have our support to act when they see wrongdoing as the bill progress would ask ministers to consider how robust the exemption be for face covering as they may be open to misuse for example the health exemption could have very broad interpretation on knife crime officer in my patch certainly welcome the change but they be concerned about how unscrupulous knife manufacturer could adapt to sell knife that while technically legal still glamorise violence in the past year have get to know woman call hayley ryall the mother of mikey roynon from kingswood who be tragically kill at birthday party when he be stab by three young man in june mikey be beautiful young man and he be just when he be kill with the ongoing trial of serious violence reduction order in thames valley the west midlands merseyside and sussex come to their conclusion this year hayley have ask when decision will be make on the wide roll out of serious violence reduction order and when that will take place all these measure will only have the full effect if we have the officer on our street to police they avon and somerset recently receive million uplift in funding and look forward to see this money use for more recruitment and to support our exist officer there be much to fix we all know that and these measure go good way to put the balance of power back towards law and order

chipping norton charlbury and the village of north and west oxfordshire in my constituency shoplifting offence increase by between march and march this be deeply concern trend not only for shopkeeper

be not just business but essential service that form part of the fabric of the community this bill send clear and powerful message that rise rate of shoplifting will not be tolerate under this

own home the lack of accountability for those responsible have leave they feel hopeless and abandon the bill take the essential step need to address antisocial behaviour such as that experience by my constituent the new respect order can be impose on individual who have engage in or threaten to engage in antisocial behaviour importantly breach respect order now constitute criminal offence for my constituent in halesowen that will provide much need reassurance that their concern be be take seriously and that those who disrupt the peace will face real consequence deputy chief constable andy prophet who lead on antisocial behaviour for the national police chiefs council say respect order will give the police and council the ability to crack down on those who persistently make our street and public space feel unsafe although those measure be promise it be important that they go hand in hand with another critical demand from my constituent the visible presence of police officer people want to see their local officer regularly patrol their street just as my mum use to do that be why be pleased to see alongside the bill the introduction of the neighbourhood policing guarantee which will ensure the deployment of an additional police officer pcso and special constable into neighbourhood policing role by reinforce community police we will not only deter and prevent crime but strengthen the response to emergency and enhance trust between the police and the public in halesowen we be fortunate to have dedicated and exemplary police officer such as sergeant nichola chester and pcso such as nathan fung as member of our excellent but stretch neighbourhood team it be vital that their effort be bolster with the resource and manpower that they need to maintain safety and security the bill be critical step towards achieve that goal the people of halesowen deserve to live without fear to walk our street with confidence and to know that their government be steadfast in their commitment to their safety the bill with its focus on tackle antisocial behaviour and reinvigorate neighbourhood policing represent decisive step in the right direction and be pleased to support it rise to support the government crime and policing bill the last time address the house on police share the fact that the borough of redbridge which lead once have five police station but after decade of conservative cut only one remain stand that be not just fact but direct reflection of how the conservative party deprioritise police and fail to protect our resident friend and neighbour when we deprioritise policing we do more than weaken law enforcement we allow crime to spiral out of control we expose our community to harm and we erode the very fabric of our society the bill be crucial step in reverse year of neglect and ensure tough consequence for criminal behaviour it tackle wide range of issue from knife crime to terrorism but want to focus on matter that affect our daily life antisocial behaviour for too long it have be treat as low level or even trivial crime but in ilford south and across the uk it be anything but trivial it erode community trust and often pave the way for more serious criminal activity we see antisocial behaviour on the ground in the nitrous oxide canister litter our street we see it in our local shop where retail worker face shoplifter daily we see it on our street where young girl often in school uniform endure harassment from man much old than they antisocial behaviour be not just an inconvenience but warning sign last year two teenager stab staff member at goodmayes station they be also charge with prior robbery incident at nearby tesco that be what happen when we turn blind eye to so call low level crime it escalate pose an even big threat to our community that be why welcome the bill it make clear statement that antisocial behaviour will no long be tolerate be particularly pleased to see the scrapping of the effective immunity for shoplifting of good under and strong protection for retail worker against assault when worker in our shop supermarket and local business can not feel safe and we can not feel safe do our weekly shopping the system have fail by end the decriminalisation of so call low level theft we be ensure that our local town centre be protect to thrive safety be about not just theft of property but the right to go about our daily life and walk our street without fear or intimidation when be leader of redbridge council we take decisive action to make our street safe for woman and girl we be the first council to use public space protection order to punish those catcall and harass woman and girl be pleased to see the strengthening of those protection order in the bill and the introduction of respect order which will ensure that community across the country have the power to tackle nuisance harassment and intimidation on our street we all deserve to feel safe in our home on our street in our shop and in our school the bill begin to turn our promise into reality in common with hon member from across the house this debate be of paramount importance to the people in my constituency the labour government have inherit shameful legacy from the conservative party which have year to address criminality and antisocial behaviour but instead leave our community feel unsafe the situation in scotland have frightening similarity with the snp government fail community across scotland since the snp introduce its bus pass initiative many of my constituent have tell that they be now afraid to visit kilmarnock bus station or even use local bus service this be not about demonise young people far from it as they be more likely to be victim of crime and antisocial behaviour than the perpetrator of it but it be wrong to ignore the significant minority who make life misery for other scotland badly need labour respect order to effectively tackle the minority behaviour that have be intimidate our community for far too long labour respect order will deliver strong power for our police in scotland help they to keep our community safe but yet again scotland be be let down by the snp and its inaction similarly the bus pass scheme which should be something to be celebrate have create situation where people of all age be now think twice about use their local bus service as my friend the scottish labour leader anas sarwar say that be find to have repeatedly act violently on bus should have their free bus pass take off they that should be obvious right should come with responsibility and it be shameful that there be currently no mechanism to withdraw free bus pass from someone who have be abuse one that need to change it be totally unacceptable to see chronic antisocial behaviour continue with no effective action from the snp the crime and policing bill demonstrate that labour be on the side of law abide people and will be proud to vote for the bill at the conclusion of the debate that bring we to the front bench contribution take this opportunity to thank our brave hard work police officer pcso police staff and volunteer for the huge sacrifice they make to keep our street safe thank all hon member across the house for their consider and concise contribution the bill cover wide array of offence and we all welcome that tackle criminality mean equip the police and enforcement agency with the power that they need to lock up dangerous perpetrator to make our street safe the bill contain meaningful and impactful provision particularly in relation to knife crime car theft retail crime the sharing of intimate image child sexual abuse drug testing and cuckoo among many other it be generous of the government to hold the previous conservative government work in such high esteem in fact about two third of the measure in the bill be copy straight from the previous government as be say think on several occasion it be copy and paste job that even the chancellor would blush over thank my right hon friend the members for braintree mr cleverly and for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith alongside many other past and current member of the house for their significant work in ensure that those offence be include in the scope of the bill that work will ultimately have positive impact on the life of all our constituent time do not allow to talk through all the measure in the bill hon member oh know that hon member be disappoint but will focus on few important provision first let turn to retail crime as hon member across this house may know have serve as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on the future of retail and as former woolies worker no one ever question whether be old enough have be very involved in the campaign to protect our retail worker have join the like of the hon member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris paul gerrard from the co op helen dickinson and the team at the british retail consortium the association of convenience stores usdaw numerous retailer and other who have work to deliver more protection for our retail worker back in during my slightly rebellious phase table an amendment that help we to make an assault on person provide service to the public statutory aggravating offence more recently in april alongside suite of measure design to tackle retail crime we see the last government agree to the creation of stand alone offence of assault retail worker be glad that that will be take up by the incumbent government and hope that it will have real impact and improve the life of these important key worker in high street and store across the country have two concern however about the bill regard retail crime first the previous government plan have propose to make it mandatory for the court to impose at least curfew requirement an exclusion requirement or an electronic monitoring requirement on repeat offender convict of shoplifting or the new offence of assault retail worker and sentence to community order or suspend sentence that have be welcome by retailer but the bill do not include any provision to this effect urge the government to look again at this to ensure that we be do all we can to protect retail worker and avoid what appear to be the watering down of potential protection secondly on the plan to remove the threshold for shoplifting while the rhetoric sound positive it be untrue to say that theft under be ever decriminalise in fact the government own impact assessment tell we that of charge for shoplifting relate to property worth less than there be fear that measure will lead to further delay to justice be do while not lead to tough or long sentence victim of retail crime deserve swift justice not year long delay while perpetrator continue to offend turn now to further legislative step that hope members across the house will find difficult to oppose one hugely important measure be the introduction of statutory aggravating factor require sentence court to treat groom behaviour as an aggravating factor when consider the seriousness of child sexual offence the opposition believe that the government should go far and establish national statutory inquiry but it be right that they have bring forward this measure from the criminal justice bill it recognise the severity of the offence and ensure that third party involve in the heinous practice of these rape gang face justice and punishment we must take every step possible to protect the most vulnerable and ensure that strong law be in place so that the terrible crime of the past can not be repeat another key measure in the bill contain in clause to expand the ability to conduct drug test upon arrest the expansion of the drug testing on arrival programme introduce by the previous conservative government have already demonstrate the sheer number of individual find to be under the influence of substance when arrest between march and september police force report total of test to the home office of these or be positive for cocaine opiate or both it be therefore right that we expand the drug testing programme to cover as wide range of class and drug as possible allow the police to access the information they need to manage offender appropriately within the criminal justice system also welcome the effort to tackle off road bike have see their impact on my constituent hope that during the passage of the bill we might consider go even far maybe even consider suggestion make by government back benchers we must use this opportunity to ensure that the police have the power they need and to examine where further power be require to ensure that the law truly serve the victim of crime and provide level of openness and transparency for our police force so that people can have confidence in our justice system additionally we should all want to see the police do what they do good on the beat prevent and investigate crime their time should not be waste on matter that the public do not consider priority time and again we see report of police officer be send to respond to incident that be not criminal in nature while serious offence on our street go unchallenged the measure in this bill to tackle antisocial behaviour signal an understanding that remove crime from our street must be priority however we must consider whether more can be do legislatively to ensure that police time be use effectively must stress that all the well mean measure contain in the bill be meaningless without well fund police force force force some lead by labour police and crime commissioner be raise legitimate concern about the level of funding they will receive from the government any reduction in police number undermine every element of this bill weaken the police ability to tackle crime across the country the head of the metropolitan police have raise his concern about potential job loss in our capital city city where of england and wales knife crime occur should note at this point that it be very welcome to see the government reintroduce many of the measure on tackle knife crime put forward in the criminal justice bill by the previous conservative government include power to retain and destroy bladed article on private property and to increase the maximum penalty for the sale of dangerous weapon to give that the financial pressure face by police force amount to an estimate million shortfall there be real concern that the government action will contribute to decline in police number the government police funding increase mask the chancellor national insurance hike on our police force and their failure to build police pay award into the baseline move forward we will have ample opportunity as house to scrutinise the legislation and consider potential improvement read the impact assessment and economic note accompany the bill reveal uncertainty about the effect of its various measure notably there be lack of clarity regard the number of individual expect to be imprison for certain offence with significant variation in the estimate provide the government must back our police over the criminal and demonstrate the political will to do so they must provide police with the resource and robust power they need to keep officer on the beat deliver swift justice for victim and in turn make our street safe this bill be step forward across the house we all need to support our police officer to tackle the heinous crime will the shadow minister give way go for it hooray thank you on swift justice will the opposition front bench bring forward amendment regard the shadow home secretary position on citizen arrest how many amendment can we expect to see about how the police should respond to citizen arrest what the shadow home secretary be do in office be put more police on the country street than ever police officer we hope the government will maintain that as we move forward but there be lot of question mark around that we all need to support our police officer to tackle the heinous crime that we have hear about in the debate hope the government remain open to consider measure propose by opposition and government members who be committed to robustly tackle the very behaviour that this legislation seek to prevent it be an honour and privilege to wind up the debate on what be as the home secretary set out in her opening speech critically important bill it be critically important for all sort of reason many of which have be highlight during the debate it have be wide range discussion which be unsurprise give the bill scope and breadth there have be many excellent and powerful contribution particularly from the government benches with over back bench speaker there be thread that bind all the bill measure together this government unwavere commitment to the security of our country and the safety of our community and people we all

government plan for change we be determined to rebuild neighbourhood policing restore confidence in the criminal justice system and reduce the harm cause by crime we have already take action to strengthen the response to threat include knife crime antisocial behaviour and violence against woman and girl but to deliver the change that the british people want and deserve we must go far and this bill will allow we to do that it be evident from the debate that there be broad cross party support for many of the bill measure it have be helpful to have the insight and experience of hon

detail in the limited time available to will focus on few of the point raise throughout the debate but there will clearly be opportunity during line by line scrutiny in committee to debate all the matter raise this evening fully and properly will start with the shadow home secretary the right hon member for croydon south chris philp who ask number of question some of which be not surprise give his focus on technology in particular in his speech he seem to be suffer from amnesia about what have happen to police and crime over the past year it be worth gently remind he that in the period from april to june last year when his government be still in post and in fact he be policing minister police number be go down just think that would gently remind he of that because he obviously need bit of help to recall what be happen on his watch of course neighbourhood policing be decimate under the previous government let get to some of the specific question that the shadow home secretary want to answer we all agree that rough sleeping and nuisance begging be complex issue we be work closely with the deputy prime minister and her department to ensure that such individual who be often vulnerable be appropriately support that be set against our commitment to stand by the police and effectively tackle crime and antisocial behaviour as it stand the vagrancy act remain in force and we know that police force in many area also use the asb power to tackle the antisocial behaviour associate with beg and rough sleeping the shadow home secretary also ask about the provision to compel offender to attend sentencing hearing as announce in the king speech in those measure will be introduce in the forthcoming victim court and public protection bill will the minister give way would really like to get on actually the shadow home secretary have quite lot of time at the beginning of the debate and would like to respond to the back benchers who have spend many hour in the chamber in order to make their point however in response to question that he ask about knife scan technology the home office be still work with industry partner to develop system that be specifically design to detect at distance knife conceal on person that work be part of the innovation competition that be launch last year and phase one be expect to be deliver by the end of may result in the first prototype system facial recognition be mention by the shadow home secretary and number of hon member and such technology be an important tool to help the police to identify offender more quickly and accurately it be show significant potential to increase police productivity and effectiveness and it could substantially contribute to our safe street mission we need to support the police by ensure that they have clarity especially where there be balance to strike between ensure public safety and safeguard the right of individual will be consider the option for that alongside broad police reform that will be in the white paper later in the spring public order particularly the issue of protest be raise by number of hon member include my hon friend the members for liverpool riverside kim johnson and for bristol north east damien egan and the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart the right to peaceful protest be fundamental part of our democracy and we

issue more fully in committee we will also be carry out expedite post legislative scrutiny of the public order act begin in may that process will look at how the legislation have operate since come into force and we will consider carefully the output of that review my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi ask to confirm that any amendment to the bill on the subject of abortion will be subject to free vote all woman have access to safe legal abortion on the nhs up to week include take early medical abortion pill at home where eligible we recognise that this be an extremely sensitive

for north west cambridgeshire sam carling speak knowledgably about the issue of mandatory reporting he refer particularly to religious group and speak about the jehovah witness and he ask for meeting to discuss the matter far the purpose of mandatory reporting be obviously to improve the protection of child and our aim be to create culture of support knowledge and openness when deal with child sexual abuse that be why we consider it more appropriate for those who fail to discharge their duty to face referral to the disclosure and barring service and professional regulator where applicable those body can prevent individual from work with child potentially lose their livelihood which be serious consequence the strong possible sanction will apply to individual where deliberate action have be take to obstruct report be make under the duty anyone who seek to prevent reporter from carry out their duty to report will face the prospect of up to seven year imprisonment my hon friend the

range of behaviour and be already consider by the court as factor that increase the seriousness of offending which may lead to an increase in the length of sentence be sure that the minister for

have call this debate about owens in hastings the short live family fun factory whose board up front be familiar and depressing sight to anyone who have walk through our town centre we be certainly not the only town to have experience board up shopfront which have become all too common on high street around the country the reason be here speak about this at pm be that owens have come to symbolise for our community much more than mere eyesore under the conservative government levelling up plan owens receive of taxpayer money at the grand opening of owens it be reveal that the owner behind it be lubov chernukhin millionaire who have donate more than million to the conservative party do ms chernukhin millionaire owner really need top up from the taxpayer to fund such venture be that truly the good use of the money give to hastings to improve our town none of that make any sense to my constituent it get bad owens close shortly after opening and the desert board up building now dominate our town centre in hastings the staff be lay off with no notice and many people who supply the business and help with the building work have say that they have not be pay for their work the closure of owens which be now cover in wooden boarding leave stain on our community owens have now be close for month what have ms chernukhin be do in that time the answer be donate vast sum of money to the conservative party it be shame that no conservative members be here to hear this because they might like to hear that the right hon member for witham priti patel who sit on the conservative front bench recently accept donation from ms chernukhin who be clearly not struggle for money these day in just the time since owens have be close she have donate more than to the conservative party ms chernukhin should donate the money she receive from the taxpayer back to the people of hastings use well it could go very long way to fix our break pave stone and bus shelter lubov chernukhin we want our money back until that money be repay in full to our community the conservative party should not take penny in donation from she again it be shame that no conservative members be here but will be write to the leader of the opposition the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch urge she not to take any more donation until that be do when she become the conservative leader she say very clearly that her party would apologise for the mistake that it have make perhaps apologise to the people of my constituency be good place to start commend the hon lady for bring forward this debate one of the thing see which she perhaps see as well it be the thrust of where she be go be that the town deal fund the government offer give great opportunity to council know that they do the same in my council area where we develop an evening dining culture and coffee culture but it take the council be the body ensure that the money be spend where it should be spend do the hon lady see the good thing that can come out of the town deal funding do she agree that we should all look at and focus on the good thing thank the hon gentleman for his passion about his area and about improve it it be so true that where money be spend properly in conjunction and collaboration with the priority of local people we see people really feel difference in their community that be why when speak to my constituent it be so frustrating for they we all know that we could have spend so much well which be where that frustration come from we be leave with board up huge building in the centre of town that we have to walk past and we be remind of that failure every time the guardian have also report that lubov chernukhin involvement in owens be at least part fund by million loan from british virgin islands company sunny gulch village that company be previously own by her husband vladimir chernukhin former deputy finance minister in putin russia and former chairman of russian bank in court case lubov herself confirm that mr chernukhin have maintain excellent relationship with prominent member of the russian establishment be that really the company that the conservative party want to keep and be that really suitable donor there be also serious question to answer about what due diligence be do under the last government before taxpayer money be hand out in this way the money be part of the town deal fund under the last government the plan for spend that money be mean to have be scrutinise by board that be representative of the local community but when have speak to local businessman and woman who sit on that board they have tell that they be give very little information about the project and pressure into sign they off one ask repeatedly to see the full business case but be tell that they could not because of commercial sensitivity why do the previous government design such process for spend taxpayer money with so little transparency for we the taxpayer local business also can not understand why the decision be take to subsidise commercial venture when they themselves have have to work so hard to get their business off the ground with no help from the taxpayer genecon consultancy be pay by the town deal board to examine the business case for each project but no research analysis or figure have ever be share do genecon ever do that due diligence all project be sign off by the then level up department what check and due diligence be do by official and ministers on those project to ensure that our taxpayer money be be spend wisely it seem that in the case of so many levelling up project proper process be not follow anyone who speak to any charity apply today for public money will be tell about all the paperwork those charity rightly have to go through why be the bar set so low for venture such as owens move forward it be vital that the same mistake be not make under this labour government we have brilliant opportunity to breathe life back into our high street sort out our empty unit and get our local economy move be really grateful to the minister for the labour government confirmation that hastings will be one of the town award million in funding toward those aim over the next decade the government have rightly say that that money should be spend on the priority of our community whether that be break pavement broken bus shelter or open up important community venue such as st mary in the castle will be publicly ask my constituent how they think that money should be spend and put on pressure for we to spend it properly the labour government be also give our community important new power such as high street rental auction these will give local leader the power to take action on property that have be leave vacant for over year grant local business and community group the right to rent empty commercial lot at market price lastly put on record my thank to the journalist involve in expose this scandal it be only because of the work of journalist at local publication such as the hastings independent press as well as at the guardian that we know what have go on never again should taxpayer money be waste in this way for that reason be also refer the case of owens to the national audit office and ask it to investigate the lesson from owens must be learn congratulate my hon friend the member for hastings and rye helena dollimore on secure this evening important debate and thank she for speak so powerfully on behalf of her constituent she be passionate champion for hastings and be lead the charge to ensure that not single penny of government investment in that town be waste we have number of thing in common we be both labour and co operative members of this house but we be also both in hastings and rye on september when the late queen pass away apart from the profound sense of how important and significant that day be what be very clear from speak to those who be now my hon friend constituent be the high regard she be hold in be glad that that be reflect in the result of the election before turn to the main subject of the debate will speak about the funding that the government be put into my hon friend constituency last week my department announce up to million of funding and support for hastings through our new plan for neighbourhood it will help build thriving hastings strengthen the local community and allow resident to take their own decision on thing that affect they we be also give hastings million for our community regeneration partnership which will help provide more affordable housing in the town and fund improvement at the hollington youth hub those investment come on top of the million town deal for hastings our town deal be base on local partnership and local decision making and they be lead by local town board know my hon friend be member of hers and know that she champion her area extremely well be pleased to see that the town deal in hastings be well into delivery and be begin to deliver result on the ground although hear her concern about owens entertainment centre which will turn to in more detail when my hon friend raise this issue in the house last
