vibrant town and picturesque village many part of my new constituency have be inhabit for several millennia with area such as topsham be settle by the celt turn into port by the romans and expand by the saxons possibly our most famous resident have be sir walter raleigh who be an elizabethan statesman soldier writer and explorer although he achieve much in his life will do my good not to meet the same fate which be to be try for treason before meet his end outside this chamber in old palace yard we have some fantastic organisation across exmouth and exeter east such as the royal national lifeboat institution which work tirelessly to keep local and tourist safe in the water around the constituency we have global expert work to advance the frontier of knowledge on weather and climate at

have some of the good farming produce anywhere in the country for those look to visit highly recommend stop in for pasty at darts farm or greendale farm shop however the organisation that have the most special place in my heart be commando training centre royal marines for decade the training camp in lympstone and the area of woodbury common have be the proving ground for all wannabe royal marines and for those from across our armed force who aspire to become commando have endure royal marine commando train over year ago be happy to announce that have learn once again to enjoy spend time on woodbury common without fear of be cold wet hungry and cover in gorse thistle the royal marines be proud organisation in its year in service to our country sadly it have become increasingly rare for former royal marine to enter this house as member however royal marines must share the same tendency that bus be afflict by none turn up for eon then four turn up at the same time although the other three former royal marines the hon and gallant members for plymouth moor view fred thomas for halesowen alex ballinger and for birmingham selly oak al carns opt to join the party now in government know that the kinship that bind royal marines together through share adversity will benefit this house and hope provide combative but constructive debate while exmouth and exeter east have much to be celebrate it also have its fair share of issue from an aged and degraded sewerage network to antisocial behaviour there be many issue that my constituent have place trust in to help improve for too long we have build new house in the area without deliver appropriate and corresponding infrastructure fear the new government top down housing target will far compound that issue and will do all can to ensure that the right mix of house be build in the right place with the right infrastructure and public consultation be also deeply concerned that large part of exmouth and exeter east will be tarmacke over within one generation of course we need new home for the next generation so that they can live near their friend family and work but we must have temper approach and ensure that we do not overdevelop and destroy our countryside and the culture of our historic town and village there be also area that will work hard to improve across exmouth and exeter east such as social care provision education scheme job opportunity transport link and support for farmer and those in rural affair it be worth voice that this new parliament bring the wind of political change to devon and the wide south west of england as new mp be open and willing to work with fellow south west mp regardless of political affinity to ensure we drive as much investment and opportunity as possible to our

the precipice of new industrial revolution frontier technology such as artificial intelligence supercomputing and nanobiotechnology will radically change our world and the relationship we have with it it be imperative that the new government understand these issue and work across the public and private sector to ensure that our united kingdom remain technological global leader there be no get away from the fact that the international system be become more volatile it be deeply sad that conversation about international conflict be no long hypothetical war have break out across multiple global region and we must act without delay to increase defence spending to meet the threat that be clearly present anthropogenic climate change have long cease to be purely an academic debate it be visible and happen now we must continue to work closely with international partner to reduce our overall global carbon emission it be beyond faux pas to speak in communist tone from the conservative benches could risk make the same treasonous mistake as sir walter raleigh however there be modern resonance in lenin purport quote there be decade where nothing happen and there be week where decade happen in isolation any of the point have raise have the ability to cause mass societal and environmental change when decade happen in week become the new normal we must keep pace to ensure the united kingdom remain strong ally and ahead of the pack in an ever change world my final message be to the people of exmouth and exeter east who send to this house promise that will always fight for we and that will represent we to the good of my ability while have the privilege of serve as their member of parliament congratulate the hon member for exmouth and exeter east david reed on his maiden speech it be joy

service after more than year represent first the constituency of mid staffordshire and then lichfield in this house thirty two year in total sir michael serve and think that would be number to which we would all aspire should be fortunate enough to still be in this place in year time madame deputy speaker can only hope to have such head of hair it be however to longevity that wish to turn now although have receive advice from some colleague not to mention the domesday book can neatly sidestep that as the record history of my constituency date back some year before william the conqueror to the roman invasion and the establishment of letocetum roman fort and later settlement near the crossroad of watling street and rykneld street in my constituency the crossing of those two road remain an important place throughout the roman and saxon period and in the century chad of mercia establish cathedral and diocese in lichfield which still exist today in just over week time will be proud to be in attendance at the installation of think the dean of lichfield cathedral the right reverend jan macfarlane will be the first woman to hold that post and will not only smash glass ceiling but be an excellent advocate for the cathedral and the church in the local community and beyond the century be also noteworthy for the burying of the staffordshire hoard which be uncover in hammerwich in my constituency in near that same crossroad of watling street and rykneld street the large collection of anglo saxon gold ever find the hoard be already have and will continue to have significant impact on our understanding of the people of these isle before there be an england scotland wales or northern ireland let move on from the century over the come year the city would continue to flourish and establish itself as religious and ecumenical centre although much of the surround area maintain its rural and agrarian aspect for many century to come in this time the area do produce innumerable great life and while they be far too numerous to mention all of they here should note gregory king the world first economic statistician elias ashmole whose collection found the ashmolean museum the first of its type in the uk david garrick the noted theatre innovator and manager the physician erasmus darwin found member of the lunar society who have rather famous grandson the poet anna seward

samuel barber be freed slave who would go on to run school in burntwood decade before tom jenkins would begin teach in teviothead in scotland and who would also serve as dozener in local government in lichfield and almost certainly become the first black man to serve in local government in the uk before move on from some famous people from around the area should mention local success story in sophie capewell lichfield golden girl bring home not just gold medal from paris this year but world record as part of team gbs fantastic effort in do so she end my reign as the most successful former pupil of my old school nether stowe in lichfield and although have hop to hold that title little long than day be happy to be disappoint on that point return to my historical tour of lichfield and its surround area we reach the early and century and the town of burntwood conurbation of mining village which grow up some four mile from lichfield and have similarly proud history its most notable resident be the fundraiser and campaigner stephen sutton who raise million for the teenage cancer trust despite his diagnosis we lose he far too soon at the age of just he be make an mbe for his fundraising so it be more than fitting that burntwood town council remember he through student award name in his honour not to be outshone by the cathedral down the road burntwood also take its place in ecclesiastical history when in st anne church in chasetown become the first in the country to have electric lighting today the people of burntwood still maintain close knit community typical of former mining area that be show by the great example of the spark café and burntwood be friend which have do so much to step in to replace service cut during long year of conservative government if we be discuss burntwood we can not forget the giant kill exploit of chasetown fc in the fa cup of at some point will forgive the members for cardiff burntwood be not the only part of my constituency that have mining history the village of handsacre also more than play its part in power the industry of the and century it be also the village where my old man teach his first lesson as probationary teacher in the the suggestion that his geordie accident be in part responsible for his hiring in school build to teach the child of new arrival from the north east remain suspect if unconfirmed mining be not the only industry that find its way to my part of staffordshire many of we will recognise the name armitage shanks but few will know its link to the village of armitage just short trip up rugeley road from handsacre as the new government focus their legislative agenda on growth remind colleague that while many of we may have already spend penny with armitage shanks they be all welcome to visit and spend many more in the come year all this industry mean that the canal come to my constituency the coventry canal and the trent and mersey canal be still navigable today and the work of the lichfield and hatherton canal restoration trust should be commend as it aim to restore that link as green and blue way over the come year have touch again on transport will complete the circle and return to the crossroad that make letocetum watle street or the as it be now know and rykneld street the be major transport artery that link my constituency together and link it easily to the rest of the country the in particular have help to establish logistic centre in the village of fradley on the site of the former raf lichfield fan of the bbc bargain hunt will know fradley well give the regular appearance of richard winterton and his auctioneer on that show hope that can get as much airtime as they do slightly far up the be the national memorial arboretum near alrewas wonderful venue as the site of national remembrance advise every single person to make visit there to remember not just in november but on any day be sure that in the come month the secretary of state for transport will grow tired of my lobbying about the need for railway station to serve that amazing location on dissimilar note the first travelodge in the uk be open slightly up the road some year ago near the village of barton under needwood although that village should be much well remember as the home of the holland tug of war team found in the team have represent england at numerous international

they be fortunate enough to represent constituency as beautiful as altrincham and sale west in many case get nagging sense from they that my mere presence in this house represent where do be

sittingbourne twin on the isle of sheppey sheerness on sea have busy dock dock that hopefully will become only busy as the opportunity for growth construction and new green industry be realise by this government sittingbourne and sheppey be perfectly locate to take advantage of all that development my job be not only to argue for our place in the rebuilding of britain but to ensure that my constituent see real social economic health and wellbeing benefit from the opportunity the factor that lead to the foundation of our town be lay century ago fit the way that technological industrial and transport strategy be all point now sittingbourne straddle the main road from dover to london and be connect directly by water road and rail to sheerness dock on sheppey this be what make the saxon king of kent grab the land and claim it as their terra regis this be something that the resident of milton regis be very proud to remind of that it be royal town in the middle of sittingbourne

the heart of green revolution but there be more to place than land and water place be make by people what will ensure that the people of my constituency get the benefit that they be cry out for as result of growth and rebuilding be the strength of our local community and the collective action that come from grassroots organisation as we move more service out of hospital to the community and try

will go from strength to strength there be swale food bank and underpin so many of the voluntary organisation in my constituency be swale community and voluntary services which foster lot of organisation help they to get start get organise and help their community part of the reason for that depth of community co operation be that my constituency face the challenge of have some of the most deprived part of kent and the south east unfortunately big driver for that be the very geography that otherwise bring in so many benefit and opportunity as sheppey be an island with only one point in the west that connect to the rest of england there be pocket of isolation and when the two bridge go down as sadly they have all too often of late people can not get off sheppey to go to work

cargo ship sink just off sheerness which be pack with something like tonne of high explosive most expert feel that as long as the ship be not disturb the seawater will gradually inactivate those explosive so if they be ever disturb enough to trigger any firework would be minor however there be minority view that if something trigger all the explosive to go off at once the result explosion would not just inundate the whole of sittingbourne and sheppey but send metre tsunami back up the thames all the way to central london swamp the palace of westminster give we all very wet foot and
