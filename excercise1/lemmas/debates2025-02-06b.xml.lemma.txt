state the public finance be leave in at the end of his government this government have have to take very difficult decision to balance the finance so we can get growth that will benefit the entire economy include the farming sector which be on its knee after year of conservative rule solicitor general the solicitor general be ask cps prosecutors what step she be take to ensure adequate number of crown prosecution service prosecutor would like to start by congratulate us attorney general pam bondi on her confirmation yesterday the attorney general and look forward to work closely with she on our long list of share priority cps prosecutor perform vital work to serve the public and deliver justice for victim we have take step to strengthen the cps workforce include by boost staff number

point this government be work very hard to do that the settlement for the cps that refer to be an extra million and it be spend some of that on increase the number of prosecutor who be able to do the important work to which he refer violence against women and girl prosecution rate what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for case involve violence against woman and girl what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for case involve violence against woman and girl the scale of violence against woman and girl in this country be intolerable and the government be treat it as the national emergency that it be the cps have begin secure conviction of offender who breach domestic abuse protection order scheme that the government introduce in november in order well to protect victim of domestic abuse although there be much more to be do that be just one example of the clear action that the government be take to meet our mission to halve violence against woman and girl in

what do the solicitor general regard as the unique challenge in rural area and what step be she take to tackle they specifically my hon friend raise an important issue she be right to highlight the unique risk face by woman in rural area include her constituency increase isolation can bring with it more risk to tackle violence against woman we need to address the overall number of prosecution which unfortunately be still far too low that be why work with the cps and the police we have bring in the domestic abuse joint justice plan which be pleased to say be already lead to modest increase in referral of domestic abuse case to improve the investigation prosecution and handling of domestic abuse case in june of rape investigation be close because the victim drop out on top of that have

commit via the attorney general to review they the example that the hon member refer to be indeed heinous the conduct of those who have be involve in such crime have rightly shock and appalled people right across the country he refer to referral to the attorney general office and it be therefore not appropriate for to comment on that specific case far have have many victim of domestic abuse write to follow lengthy period of inaction from the police the crown prosecution service and other organisation which have leave victim at risk and feel horribly anxious how will the minister ensure that prosecution rate improve and victim have confidence in the criminal justice system the hon member make an important point be sorry to hear of the example that she raise this government have historic

tackle fraud in scotland my hon friend be right that fraud do not acknowledge border particularly when it come to the increase harm associate with online fraud that be why it be so important that the sfo work closely with the scottish law enforcement authority in that respect and in other this government be fully commit to strengthen the union thank the solicitor general for that reply we in northern ireland understand that economic crime be use by paramilitary to fund their organisation and criminal group in america al capone be put in jail not for the crime he commit but for tax evasion and financial issue will the attorney general target paramilitary group for their effort to raise money illegally the hon member make an important point this government take economic crime incredibly seriously include when it link to the serious type of activity to which he refer attorney general office transparency and conflicts of interest what step she be take to increase transparency in the attorney general office what step she be take to manage conflict of interest in the attorney general office what step she be take to manage conflict of interest in the attorney general office the attorney general office have rigorous process for identify and deal with conflict and potential conflict that arise from law officer former practice as part of that process the ago adopt cautious and beyond reproach threshold to any conflict or potential conflict these arrangement be long stand and part of standard practice that have apply across successive administration three former law officer have criticise the attorney general for not declare his earning label it as irregular and break from normal practice who be in the wrong the three former law officer or the attorney general the hon member will know that the attorney general cease all private practice follow his appointment the hon member refer to fee agreement and he will know that there be different arrangement and requirement for declaration for member of the house of lords and for member of the house of commons it do not matter which type of fee agreement be in place between lawyer and their client because the entirety of those agreement whether conditional fee agreement damages base agreement on fully pay basis or when act pro bono will always be catch by the conflict process the requirement for the purpose of the house of lords be the same for all peer and they apply just as much to the shadow attorney general as to the attorney general do the solicitor general agree with the recent policy exchange research paper conflict of interest and the law officers convention author by dr conor casey senior lecturer at surrey law school and support by three former ministers who be all kc that invoke the law officer convention on question about the potential conflict of interest relate to the work of the attorney general would be an error as such question do not fall within the scope of the convention as have say the attorney general office have rigorous process for identify and deal with conflict and potential conflict that arise from the law officer former practice the law officer convention to which the right hon member refer exist for very good reason which be to enable the government of this country to receive full and frank advice in any event the attorney general have be clear that he do not agree with that report in particular he do not agree that law officer would indicate whether they have recuse themselves from particular matter because that in itself would breach the law officer convention my constituent in central suffolk and north ipswich be decent tolerant and thoughtful people but they be leave wonder how the prime minister have appoint an attorney general who be friend and labour party donor as well as someone who have represent gerry adams shamima begum and hamas and clearly have question to answer regard outside earning do the solicitor general think that the ag be an appropriate appointment again unfortunately the opposition be fall into the trap of believe that barrister be their client that be deliberate conflation of representation and endorsement as the hon member will be fully aware barrister be not their client in the same way that surgeon be not their patient that be foundational principle of the british legal and judicial system and opposition members ought not to undermine that do the solicitor general agree that the uk legal system be the envy of the world and key engine for growth in our economy and that the conservative party risk undermine fundamental principle of our legal system that everyone have the right to representation and that lawyer can represent their client without fear or favour wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend the conservative party would do well to talk up our excellent british legal and judicial system rather than consistently seek to undermine the foundational principle to which he refer call the shadow solicitor general the attorney general have admit to recuse himself from certain matter he have also maintain absolute silence about which matter those may be in these circumstance we must ask ourselves be that the level of transparency that our democracy demand what safeguard exist when the attorney general past client and present duty overlap who independent of the attorney general himself scrutinise those critical decision on recusal or do we face the concern spectacle of the government chief legal adviser mark his own homework as have outline the attorney general office have rigorous and long stand process in place upon appointment the ago compile list of matter in which the law officer have previously be involve by search case cross referencing with information obtain by the law officer chamber or firm and work through the list with the law officer themselves the office work with the government legal department the foreign commonwealth and development office the crown prosecution service and the serious fraud office to obtain additional information and compile the final list of conflict and action associate with each case as the shadow solicitor general know the attorney general can not publish list of his former client due to client confidentiality interruption opposition members groan but client confidentiality be fundamental principle absolutely ridiculous the shadow solicitor general mention recusal the attorney general have already indicate in the other place that he have recuse himself from matter the law officer convention prohibit from list those matter no other law officer have ever publish list of the case that they be recuse from the solicitor general her predecessor and every conservative law officer from the previous administration rightly and properly understand their duty to declare previous earning why do the attorney general refuse to declare money receive from his practice as barrister why do he not acknowledge whether he continue to receive such payment when his predecessor routinely declare both why do this attorney general think that there be one rule for he and another rule for everyone else the attorney general be in the house of lords so the rule that apply be different from those that apply in the house of commons that be the difference between the attorney general and the previous solicitor general and those requirement be the same for all peer include the attorney general and they apply just as much to the shadow attorney general the lords commissioners for standards say that they consider the complaint make by the shadow justice secretary about the peers code of conduct and dismiss they order it be past am and we need to get through some more question devolve administration whether she have have meeting with her counterpart in the devolved administration since take office this government be commit to strengthen relation with devolved government and foster great collaboration build on mutual respect and trust as the hon member would expect the law officer very regularly meet our counterpart to discuss our share priority the scottish national party deposit return scheme be complete shamble which the last conservative government stop prevent it from hurt scottish business with more regulation and high cost the snp government be now face legal action over the scheme with business seek hundred of million of pound in compensation appreciate that the solicitor general can not comment on live case but will she confirm that the snp government will be solely responsible for any cost that may be incur in handle the case the hon member be right that can not comment on the specific matter that he raise but be happy to look at it and to write to he criminal justice system use of technology what assessment she have make of the potential merit of the use of technology to improve efficiency in the criminal justice system new technology have the potential to bring transformative benefit to the criminal justice system as it do to public service more broadly with regard to artificial intelligence both the cps and the sfo be keen to explore the efficiency opportunity that this new technology can bring while be mindful of ethical consideration we have see sickening rise in predator use ai technology to generate child sexual abuse image be glad that the government recently announce measure to close the loophole in this area but will the solicitor general assure we that the whole criminal justice system be use every new technology and ai as well as tough sentence to crack down on it and protect child and victim of this horrific abuse my hon friend be right to raise this extremely important point that be exactly why welcome the home secretary announcement that this government will be the first in the world to make it illegal to possess create or distribute ai tool design to generate child sexual abuse material punishable by up to five year in prison rural crime prosecution rates what step she be take to help ensure increase prosecution rate for rural crime the government be commit to keep everyone in this country safe whether they live in town city or rural area that be why we be put more police officer and police community support officer on the beat and it be why we have bolster the crown prosecution service workforce with specific regard to rural crime we be commit to implement the equipment theft prevention act and to the continue funding of the national rural crime unit as be sure the solicitor general know fly tipping be the most commonly report rural crime in the last year for which there be full datum there be well over significant multi load incident use the phrase specifically as it be an internal description those incident cost more than million to clear up yet just custodial sentence be hand out in that time what assurance can she give and my constituent that the most egregious example of fly tipping like those we see in lichfield two week ago will result in jail time for the perpetrator fly tipping blight community and be grateful to my hon friend for raise the issue know that he have also raise it with the minister for food security and rural affairs but be happy to arrange meeting with his local chief crown prosecutor to discuss the matter far call the liberal democrat spokesperson the tragic hit and run case of ryan saltern in my rural north cornwall constituency as well as many other case across the country highlight concern problem in our legal system the driver fail to stop render aid

be through similarly tragic circumstance will discuss the case that the hon member raise with my colleague in the ministry of justice and ensure that he receive full response hate crime prosecution what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of people who commit hate crime whether online or in person stir up hatred or incite violence will not be tolerate the government be determined to take swift and robust action to stamp out hate crime and perpetrator will face the full force of the law february mark lgbt history month and last night many people come together in speaker house to hear about the progress that have be make in tackle hate crime against the lgbt community will the solicitor general outline what step have be take to ensure that trans people in particular feel safe and that perpetrator of hate crime towards tran people be bring to justice the cps prosecute all case that be refer to it provide that they meet the full code test for crown prosecutor think we would all admit that there be more to do regard the incident to which the hon member refer the cps and police national hate crime lead be commit to joint working to increase the number of police referral to the cps for hate crime offence call the chair of the justice committee the criminal legal aid advisory board have ask the government to raise fee in rape and serious sexual offence case to address the shortage of advocate prosecutor often earn to less than defence barrister in the same case do the solicitor general think that she should have look at fee to ensure that there be not shortage of advocate particularly in these serious case my hon friend be right to identify this as problem know from discussion with rasso charity in my constituency that the shortage of counsel be direct contributor to case be adjourn or delay it contribute to the unfortunate slow pace of justice and to victim attrition minister in the ministry of justice have commit to work with the bar leadership via the criminal legal aid advisory board and to look at long term reform of legal aid israel and the occupied palestinian territories urgent question to ask the foreign secretary to make statement on the situation in israel and the occupied palestinian territories be grateful to my hon friend for raise this important matter and for the urgent question be grant the whole house will be well aware that for the people of gaza so many of whom have lose life home or love one the last month of conflict have be living nightmare the uk be clear that we must see negotiate two state solution with sovereign palestinian state which include the west bank and gaza alongside safe and secure israel with jerusalem as the share capital that have be the framework for peace for decade our priority remain ensure the fragile ceasefire continue that all the hostage be release that much need aid get into gaza and that we can rebuild that pathway to sustainable peace palestinians must determine the future of gaza with support from regional state and the wide international community we would oppose any effort to move palestinians in gaza to neighbour arab state against their will there must be no forced displacement of palestinians nor any reduction in the territory of the gaza strip palestinian civilian should be able to return to and rebuild their home and their life that be right guarantee under international law gaza be home to million palestinians and remain an integral part of what must become future palestinian state with palestinians live next to israelis in peace and security the us have play critical role in negotiate the ceasefire agreement between israel and hamas alongside qatar and egypt as hon member may know the prime minister reiterate that in his call with president trump we must now work together to ensure the ceasefire be implement in full and become permanent the uk be invest in the ceasefire by do all it can to support the surge in aid that be need alongside our exist support on january announce furth million in funding to ensure healthcare food and shelter reach ten of thousand of civilian and to support vital infrastructure across the occupied palestinian territories and neighbouring country we be also concerned at the expansion of the government of israel war aim and operation in the west bank stability be essential at this crucial time we recognise israel right to defend itself and the continue threat pose by armed group but it must show restraint and ensure the scale and conduct of its operation be commensurate to the threat pose civilian must be protect and the destruction of civilian infrastructure minimise the uk remain opposed to illegal settlement their expansion and settler violence in conclusion our attention must now turn to how we secure permanently well future for the israeli and palestinian people ground to reiterate the point final time in two state solution thank my right hon friend for her statement the context in which we approach this question be follow month of bloodshed and the death of almost palestinians and welcome temporary ceasefire so the remark of the us president in conference with the israeli prime minister that the us will take over the gaza strip to create riviera of the middle east and that million palestinians live in gaza should live in other country be reckless and dangerous that have embolden the israeli defence minister katz overnight to far propose the displacement of palestinians from gaza the remark be generate fear and tension in the palestinian population and across the middle east as evidence by the statement of egypt jordan saudi arabia and other and will cause concern and more determined demonstration in the uk the us president have also restore arm shipment end funding to the united nations relief and works agency and withdraw from the un human rights council netanyahu say that israel will redraw the map and the israeli defence forces have detonate whole street in the jenin refugee camp in the west bank in such dangerous circumstance we should be careful calculated and accurate in our use of language force displacement of the type advocate which have already occur within the gaza strip be breach of international humanitarian right and war crime advocate the expulsion of people be also justly describe as ethnic cleansing and can only be achieve through yet far appalling violence acknowledge that the government will wish to maintain their diplomatic relationship with the us as long stand friend but it be the role of friend to be honest with each other and the uk must use its influence the prime minister remark yesterday that the palestinians must be allow home be most welcome but the government must go far will the minister say that the uk reject the president remark and those of the israeli prime minister and defence minister will she confirm that recognition of the palestinian state be an urgent necessity in resolve the conflict will she confirm that the border of that state be the border set out in un security council resolution finally when will the uk government respond to the international court of justice advisory opinion on the israeli occupation of the occupied palestinian territories be grateful to my hon friend for his many point of course he be right to underline the appalling suffering that so many gazans have experience over recent month we also recognise the suffering of the hostage and their family this have be truly horrendous time for gazans palestinians and israelis the ceasefire must be hold to not just in phase but in phase and and ultimately we must see two state solution my hon friend talk about the role of egypt jordan and saudi arabia reassure he that the uk continue to work with all partner in the region towards peace which be so important he mention unrwa be sure he be aware of the uk government position we believe that unrwa must continue to operate not just in gaza but on the west bank and in relation to palestinian refugee in the region more broadly he also mention the situation in jenin we have be very clear there must be de escalation we be deeply concerned about the potential for further instability because of recent development in my hon friend primary question around displacement he refer to the prime minister statement yesterday the prime minister could not have be clear in what he say like so many of we be move by the image of thousand of palestinians literally walk through the rubble to try to find their home and their community in gaza they must be allow home they must be allow to rebuild and we should be with they in that rebuild on the way to two state solution official report february vol the uk position have be crystal clear do not believe that there be any confusion around it and appreciate that my hon friend be not suggest that there be my hon friend ask about the uk position on recognition he will be aware that we have state that position number of time in the house include at length in the statement by the foreign secretary on the ceasefire deal when that be agree we be very clear the palestinians have the right just as the israelis do to their own sovereign state where they can live in security we be determined to ensure that recognition at the time when that be most conducive to achieve two state solution which be the right of both those people finally on the subject of the icj my hon friend will be aware that the court determination be very detailed judgment which it take many month to come to as behove such judgment it be important that the government consider it in detail that be exactly what we be do and we will update colleague as soon as we have come to determination on that call the shadow minister the ceasefire remain fragile there continue to be long road ahead we want the agreement to hold and that mean that each and every hostage must be release in accordance with the term of phase of the agreement and the subsequent phase the video we have all watch of the release hostage be reunite with their family be immensely move we can not even begin to imagine the pain that they have suffer since october we also hold firmly in our thought the hostage who remain in cruel captivity at the hand of hamas and the family who continue to anxiously await news of their love one the awful news that eight hostage will not make it home alive must be unbearable for the family we reiterate our call for the government to do everything in their power with partner to push for humanitarian access to those who be still be hold hostage the uk should offer whatever practical support it can to facilitate the smooth release of hostage the testimony of emily damari about the location of her captivity be also very serious and thorough and independent investigation be urgently need would be grateful for clarity from the minister on how the uk government be formally respond beyond call for an investigation on the subject of aid to gaza can the minister give we an update on three point first what be the turnaround time for british aid the time between it reach warehouse in the region and its enter gaza secondly what metric if any be the government use to monitor the distribution of that aid when it have enter gaza finally since the ceasefire have additional type and category of aid be deliver be grateful to the right hon lady for all her question but also for the concern that she express about the situation of the remain hostage and their family when be in tel aviv have the privilege of meet the brother of emily damari as well as other hostage family and obviously their suffering have be extreme as the right hon lady say it have be particularly harrowing for the family of the eight hostage who have die know that the whole house will recognise the pain and suffering that have be undergo by the very large number of gazans who have lose their life great many people be of course unaccounted for for many of we the situation be unimaginable as we try to put ourselves in the shoe of those return to their former home in some case try to find out whether their family member be under the rubble what horrific experience they must be go through the right hon lady ask three question with which will deal in moment but she also rightly press on the issue of emily damari captivity and the allegation that she have be hold in unrwa facility commissioner lazzarini the head of unrwa have say that claim that hostage be hold in unrwa premise be disturbing and agree with he welcome unrwa call for independent investigation of any misuse of its facility and indeed there have be investigation previously the colonna review investigate other allegation and the uk have work with unrwa to ensure that those investigation be thorough and that the appropriate change be make let turn to the right hon lady question she ask about the turnaround time for uk aid get into gaza certainly we have see far speedy throughput but be sure that she would agree that we need to see commercial shipment of good get into gaza that be necessary if there be to be delivery of food and other supply on the scale that be require we continue to push the government of israel to enable that to happen as quickly as possible as for the metric be use when it come to the distribution of that aid we be work closely with trust partner and as the right hon lady would expect we continuously monitor the distribution of uk supply much of our activity have be undertake jointly with other country as well as with un agency and we work closely with they to ensure that aid be deliver where it be need lastly the right hon lady ask whether there have be change in type of aid we need access for tent in particular as well as other form of shelter and medical supply when be in jordan see medical supply that it have not be possible to deliver to gaza and we need access for those we have see improvement in some area but give the scale of the challenge we need to see further improvement especially in relation to water and sanitation where there have be great deal of destruction urgent action be need to improve the position rise to those member who be seven minute late please do not embarrass each other by stand we have see really worry escalation of violence on the west bank just at the time when this fragile peace have be find in gaza large part of jenin refugee camp have be completely destroy by israeli security force and thousand have be forcibly displace unrwa service have be interrupt what measure be the minister take to ensure that palestinians can live safely and securely in their home on the west bank be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue she have considerable expertise in the area of humanitarian support as do many other member in the chamber as say in my previous response the uk be very concerned about the situation in jenin which we continue to monitor very carefully we be clear that peace and stability on the west bank be in everyone interest it be in the state of israel interest and in the interest of palestinians on december in statement at the un security council meeting on the occupied palestinian territories the uk call on israel to stop illegal settlement expansion on palestinian land and we be consider all option for take further action call the liberal democrat spokesperson president trump proposal for the forced displacement of gaza million inhabitant would constitute grave violation of international law and threaten the fragile ceasefire and the return of the hostage will the minister condemn they the palestinian people have right to self determination and to state of their own as have be british policy for decade so will the government finally commit to an immediate recognition of palestinian state along the border the welcome ceasefire have give we the opportunity to flood gaza with aid but the freeze to us aid funding be reportedly impact the humanitarian response non governmental organisation be be force to lay off aid worker what have the impact be on the humanitarian response in gaza include on british fund programme and what conversation be the government have with our american partner to persuade they that abolish us aid would be dire mistake be grateful to the hon lady for the important point she raise the uk position on the right to return could not be clear quote the prime minister remark which be most definitely that palestinians must be allow to go back to their home and community in gaza and must be allow to rebuild that be in line with international law there be no doubt whatsoever about the uk position on this the hon lady ask about the position on recognition respond to that when answer my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald the uk have be clear that we believe it be important that both palestinians and israelis have the sovereignty that be require for they and the security that be necessary in order to live in peace we will ensure that the uk decision on recognition be contribution to the process towards two state solution which we desperately need to see finally the hon lady ask about us aid be grateful to she and other members for come to our briefing yesterday with the minister for the middle east my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer in which we cover this matter the uk note the us decision to pause foreign aid funding for three month pende review there have be lot of commentary about that it be fast move situation and we be monitor it very closely indeed as the hon lady would expect of course this be matter for the united states the uk be very clear that we must continue to do what we can to support people in gaza must provide life sustain support and must work with whole range of partner on this and we will continue to do so vast swathe of infrastructure in gaza have be destroy what work be the government undertaking on support the palestinian people to rebuild their home and community as be their right under international law this be critical issue of course we need the ceasefire to be hold to as say we have to move through phase to phase and but we also need to ensure that there be day after next phase planning in gaza so that we can see the building up of gaza governance and security institution and of course infrastructure as my hon friend rightly state we be clear that gaza recovery and reconstruction must be palestinian lead we have support the palestinian authority in particular on this be very proud that uk expertise have be support that work so that this important reconstruction can continue at the require pace and scale but we need to see the ceasefire hold to enable that what practical support be the government give to egypt now that the rafah crossing have reopen for medical emergency when that happen previously it put enormous pressure on the egyptian health service and cause some civil unrest in egypt as the right hon lady know egypt be also under pressure on its southern border due to the conflict in sudan do she agree that support for egypt at this critical time be very important be grateful to the right hon gentleman for underline egypt role in this incredibly difficult humanitarian situation and particularly in relation to medical evacuee from gaza he be also right to underline that egypt be now house many refugee from sudan too reassure the right hon gentleman that the uk be seek to work with egypt we have support the egyptian ministry of health and population with million deliver through who egypt to support medically evacuate palestinians from gaza we be explore further support for the egyptian system which be gear up to receive large number of medical evacuee the world be watch so let we be clear in this house that the uk reaction to this brazen attempt to far rip up international law will echo for generation with palestinians kill the ceasefire hang by thread and now blueprint to ravage gaza ethnically cleanse palestinians and resettle the land where exactly have diplomacy and refuse to sanction israel lead we palestinians be now face mass expulsion reoccupation and resettlement all while the international rule base order have be rip to shred believe it have be incredibly important for the uk to engage diplomatically in relation to this conflict it be absolutely right that we have seek to work with partner on these issue that we have support statement within the un security council that we have work with partner in the region that we have seek to achieve change and that we seek to ensure the ceasefire be agree we need to see more hostage release we need surge of aid into gaza and ultimately we need to work with other country towards the two state solution that be so necessary believe our work have be important and believe that member would not have forgive the uk government if we have not engage determinedly with those action my hon friend ask about the uk position particularly on the right to return we have state very clearly include at the high level with the prime minister statement yesterday that those who be walk through the rubble to get back to their home and community in gaza must be allow home of course in say that the prime minister be restate international law do the minister accept that we get here after month of weakness and vacillation by both this government and the previous government as we contemplate the hundred of thousand of people who be return to their home to dig out their relative from under the rubble the welcome return of the hostage and the odd orphan and even more amputee do she recognise that the hot air we have hear from both government frankly get we to situation in which the israelis be demolish building in jenin with people still inside and in which the president of the united states be openly contemplate the forcible transfer of palestinians if the right hon lady accept that vacillation will she confirm couple of thing for the avoidance of doubt first be arabs and palestinians in particular entitle to the same protection under international law as everybody else secondly do we still affirm our support for un security council resolution which guarantee the palestinians safety security and sovereignty in their own land if so when will she stop just talk about it and actually take action to enforce these matter in law as the right hon member be aware and as we have discuss previously this uk government have take different approach from the previous government on matter of accountability we be very clear that the uk arm export regime have to be hold to and operate in line with international humanitarian law that underwrite the decision we take in the autumn we say we would examine that regime and deliver on it and we examine that regime and suspend number of licence he be also aware about the new uk government different position on the legitimacy of the international criminal court the international court of justice and unrwa and he be aware that we resume fund for unrwa do not want to labour the point because so many hon member want to ask question but it be important that the uk have engage in diplomacy and seek to work with our partner believe hon member would expect the uk government to do that and to engage with the un on these matter rather than to walk away would underline that international law be universal it must be that be its found principle it operate regardless of circumstance or which population and individual we be talk about on the right hon member last point we have be very clear about the right to return the television footage of many thousand of palestinian man woman and child walk back to northern gaza be powerful reminder not just of the forceable displacement they have already suffer but of the extraordinary resilience of that people that be why there be real anger among palestinians today that yet again the very existence of their homeland be be subject to the whim of another colonial power be pleased that the minister have confirm that the uk have an unshakable policy on the right of return of those palestinians to rebuild their home and their life but would she agree with the un secretary general who say today that stay true to international law be essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing be grateful to my hon friend for again raise the image that so many of we have see on our television screen of palestinians return to their home in gaza as the prime minister explain in many case they have no choice but to walk back to their home because of the destruction of road and other infrastructure but many of those home have be destroy my hon friend be right that the experience of displacement have be feel by very significant number of gazans up to of gazans have be displace at least once and some up to nine time to underline yet another time the uk commitment to international law be very clear the prime minister and the foreign secretary have restate that and restate it again today be grateful to the minister for her response to my hon friend the member for esher and walton monica harding on usaid and grateful to know that the impact assessment of the us government decision about usaid be ongoing particularly in relation to the humanitarian situation in gaza as part of that assessment should the government consider return to of gross national income for overseas development assistance if the us be no long reliable global partner then surely the uk should be on return to of gni be spend on overseas development the hon lady will be aware that my party position the position of the government be that we be determined to return to that level of spending as fiscal circumstance allow we be clear that we must play part in humanitarian question and more broadly on development we must seek to work in partnership with other country we be do that and have ensure that have feed into our decision for next year one year spending review and that will be the case for the long term spending review as well the prime minister be quite clear when he say at that dispatch box that the right of gazans to return and remain on their land be absolute as they return there be many hundred of thousand of psychologically and physically damaged child which be unprecedented in recent memory what can we the british state do to help they know that my hon friend will be concern about this issue give his considerable medical expertise the uk have be act to ensure that we be do our part to support child in gaza and we will continue to do so we be have urgent discussion with our partner on this and those discussion extend to the concern issue around psychosocial trauma that have be experience by child and ensure that those vulnerable child receive the support that they need in the future it be welcome news that some hostage have be release but the shocking scene that we have see of brave young woman surround by terrorist demonstrate that hamas be still in charge in gaza the question now turn to how we ensure that the palestinian people can return to safe and secure home that the terror tunnel be destroy and that hamas play no part in the governance of gaza give that hamas be in charge and that president trump have make an announcement about how all this could be do what will the british government do to come up with counter proposal that be both reasonable and achievable share the hon member concern about those scene and be sure that other member in the house do so as well the uk government have be very clear hamas must not play part in those future governance arrangement we have be seek to work in practical manner with the palestinian authority especially make sure that they have the expertise that they need for their reform programme and work towards the reconstruction and recovery that be so important in gaza the minister be right to say that the past month in gaza have be living nightmare and that we need safe and secure palestine alongside safe and secure israel agree absolutely that there must be no forced displacement of gazans will the minister say more about how we be focus on the key issue here which be how the uk be support ceasefire and the rebuilding of gaza be grateful to my hon friend for her important question the uk have seek to invest in the ceasefire that be the reason why just last week we announce additional humanitarian support and support in relation to much need service in gaza so that we could ensure that that surge in aid which be so necessary be not just there now but sustain that be important so that we can progress from phase of the ceasefire to phase then phase and ultimately towards two state solution no amount of row back by the us state department can change the fact that what the united states president intimate early this week amount to ethnic cleansing be the uk government of the same view that if prosecute his plan would amount to ethnic cleansing if not what do the uk government understand ethnic cleansing to be have hear an awful lot of warm word from the government and ambition about what we believe in what we stand for and what we have deliver around the immediate humanitarian crisis but let we not forget that the horror that have happen over the past month be due to the vacuum create by international inaction over the plight of the palestinians for the last year what will this government do to change that drastic situation few moment ago list the decision that the uk government have take that be different from those of the previous government we have be determine to ensure that we be very clear about the jurisdiction of the international criminal court and the international court of justice we have also remove that ban on unwra funding and support move at the un through the security council that have be specifically focus on try to push forward the two state solution that be so important refer the hon gentleman to my previous remark about the prime minister himself underline the importance of that right to return yesterday we welcome the prime minister comment about how the palestinians must be allow home and must be allow to rebuild we should be with they in that rebuild and on the way to two state solution yet settler violence against palestinians continue to increase will the minister confirm that this government have no intention of lift the sanction that the uk have impose on israeli settler and settler group and will the government even consider expand they my hon friend will be aware that the uk have impose believe it be in the autumn sanction against those who have engage in and promote violence as settler we condemn that activity and believe that it reduce the prospect of two state solution of course for to talk about future sanction designation from the dispatch box would reduce their efficacy and therefore will not do that here thank the minister for the clarity of her answer today we be all aware that iran play major role through its antisemitic regime in fund hamas and hezbollah with the stated aim of destroy the state of israel if there be to be faith in the reconstruction of gaza people who want to do that will have to have faith that there be secure situation the attitude of this white house towards iran be different from the previous one what action be the government take and how be they involve in ensure that iran be not able to re establish itself to fund and arm the group that specifically want to destroy the state of israel be grateful to the right hon member for his comment the uk government be clear that iran have long destabilise the middle east that have obviously be do through military mean but it have also give financial and political support to its proxy and partner include iranian align militia group in iraq and syria hezbollah in lebanon which he mention and the houthis in yemen we will continue to work with international partner to encourage de escalation long term peace and security in the middle east can not be achieve without address iran destabilising activity the uk government be clear on that trump have lift the lid on israel real plan the ethnic cleansing the forced displacement of palestinians nobody can claim any long that they do not know or do not know what be go on genocide all the warm word in the world about two state solution will not stop it only sanction will as the world top court demand that mean ban on israeli settlement good enter this country it mean sanction on trade and an arm embargo without do that people in this house will never be able to say that we do everything we could to stop these crime that will echo down the generation will the minister confirm that the government will finally treat israel as they have rightly treat russia and impose widespread sanction on my hon friend question about force displacement be very clear early about the fact that the uk government be absolutely determined to ensure that there be not force displacement that would be contrary to international law gazan must be allow home and in the word of the prime minister himself must be allow to report february vol my hon friend ask about the situation in relation to arm export he will be aware that on september we suspend number of export licence to israel for use in military operation in gaza and refer he to my previous response on sanction designation president trump comment early this week be grossly irresponsible and dangerous do the minister recognise that forcible displacement of population under occupation constitute ethnic cleansing and be war crime will she clearly and unequivocally condemn the remark of president trump will she recognise the state of palestine as an essential step to the long term sustainable peace that she have articulate support for as mention just few second ago we have be clear that any attempt to prevent gazans from return home to their community and to suggest that they must remain and be house in other arab state would be contrary to international law be sure that the hon lady understand that not only have she hear say it but she hear the prime minister say it yesterday and the foreign secretary have say it many time the hon lady ask about our approach to recognition agree with she that the lever of recognition be important and will be crucial for the two state solution which will be so important to peace in the region that be why the uk be so carefully consider how we go about that we know that ultimately both israelis and palestinians have the right to live in sovereign state in security and we will ensure that our action be as strong as possible to get we to that outcome very much welcome the minister unequivocal commitment to two state solution the government be right to reject anything that risk undermine the ceasefire and the release of the remain hostage however no top down political solution will be sustainable unless we build trust between israeli and palestinian community and support the peacebuilder of the future the prime minister have commit the uk to take lead on an international fund for peace between israelis and palestinians will the minister provide an update on the progress that have be make on that fund be grateful to my hon friend for what he say about the clarity of the uk position know that he and many other in the chamber be passionate about peacebuilde that be an area in which the uk have certain amount of expertise derive from those who have be peacebuilde in northern ireland and other contexts and it be important that we seek to contribute to it of course the most urgent thing be to ensure that the ceasefire be hold to and that we move from phase to phase to phrase of course in future it will be important to do what we can to contribute to peacebuilding he be right about the prime minister announcement we be right now consider how we can ensure that that be deliver many constituent include maggie gardiner have kindly contact about their deep concern for the wellbeing of dr hussam abu safiya who have be detain by the idf have write to the foreign secretary about that and know that the government have raise the issue with the israeli authority what explanation have be receive in those meeting and what further work be the foreign secretary undertaking to obtain more detail on that important case be grateful to the hon gentleman constituent for raise that important issue which many member and the general public be concern about as he say as he rightly state the uk government have raise that issue with israeli counterpart we be concerned about the situation we believe that there need to be clarity on why any individual include medical staff be be hold it be also crucial that the red cross be able to visit those who have be detain we have make that point very forcefully since the ceasefire in gaza there have be open warfare against civilian in the west bank dehumanising of the whole palestinian population and the threat of ethnic cleansing through second nakba surely we can expect proportionate response from the uk government start with the advisory opinion recognition and the banning of trade with settlement be grateful to my hon friend for raise the situation in the west bank we be deeply concerned by the intensity of idf military operation in the west bank as well as by attack from palestinian militant we recognise israel need to defend itself against security threat but we be deeply worried about the method that israel have employ and about report of civilian casualty and the destruction of civilian infrastructure we be clear that it be in no one interest to see further conflict and instability welcome the commitment that the minister have give the house and the determination to show our opposition to trump disgraceful approach but be disappointed that she do not see this as the ideal moment to commit to recognise the state of palestine what be be do across government to reassure the community in this country who have suffer outrageous abuse since october want to underline to the hon lady that as we have make very clear palestinian statehood be the right of the palestinian people it be not in the gift of any neighbour and be essential to the long term security of israel as well the uk be work with partner to support path to long term peace and stability with two state solution the hon lady rightly raise the issue of abuse and the uk government of course condemn any form of abuse we have see disturbing rise in antisemitism and also in islamophobia all form of hatred must be condemn and act against and we be work hard against that hatred particularly through the ministry of housing communities and local government how do the government address amnesty international concern that economic activity with illegal israeli settlement contribute to both their sustainability and their growth thus undermine palestinians right and that business enterprise involve with israel illegal settlement may be involve and complicit in international crime we be very clear that israeli effort to undermine two state solution through settlement building settler violence and punitive economic measure be unacceptable we be aware that settlement expansion reach record level in the past year which be very disturbing and of course it have be accompany by an increase in settler violence our position on this issue have be clear but will reiterate it briefly we know that settlement be illegal under international law they present an obstacle to peace and threaten the physical viability of two state solution the current ceasefire be clearly welcome but it be fragile give that israel seem determined to pursue policy of expansionism we have see the bombing in jenin and the expansion into southern lebanon as well as into the buffer zone of the golan height and israel will only be embolden by the irresponsible rambling of the new us president do the minister agree that we be witness ethnic cleansing and can urge the uk government to lead at the united nations with new resolution for marshall plan to ensure the rebuilding of gaza on the term of the palestinian people be grateful to my hon friend for raise the issue of the role that the uk can play in the recovery and rebuilding of gaza as mention we have be work with range of partner on that issue seek to support the palestinian authority and contribute expert to their endeavour the world bank have conduct an update damage assessment we be look very closely at that and seek to work with the world bank and other partner on this issue call ben lake diolch mr speaker any proposal that would oversee the forcible transfer of the entire population of gaza would clearly constitute an egregious breach of international humanitarian law but it would also amount to ethnic cleansing the government have previously emphasise the importance of rule base international order underpin by adherence to international humanitarian law but how do they hope to defend and strengthen that order when yet another permanent member of the united nations security council seem intent on dismantle it be grateful to the hon gentleman for his word and for make it clear that the uk government do indeed support rule base international order that be critical to international law include international humanitarian law as we have be discuss we have repeatedly make that position clear and we will continue to hold to it include within the un and with all of our partner we know that the ceasefire be incredibly fragile and that there have be breach with impunity in particular we think about the people of jenin at this time do the minister recognise that the lack of recognition of palestine now be deny people across palestine the protection that they need that protection be critical at every stage the uk government have be absolutely clear that we have see far too much death and destruction in gaza we be now see truly heart rend scene of people try to return to community that have be destroy and we have see over people be kill that population require our support and do not believe that be contingent on political circumstance would like to thank the minister for her update yesterday which be greatly appreciated do she agree with that we be stand on the precipice of new and dangerous world order leave behind one that base global peace on global justice that we have recognise close to palestinian man woman and child have be kill while hundred of thousand be return to the rubble that be once their home and as we speak mother be look for their child in the rubble at the same time the most powerful man in the most powerful country in the world be behave like gangster he be talk about displace these people from their land replace their home with beachfront property and create casino and riviera be this not the time to categorically use the same word we use for other conflict and call this out for what it be the ethnic cleansing of the palestinian people we must immediately recognise palestinian state and can we stand up to president trump and tell he that gaza be not for sale as state in response to the question from the hon member for ceredigion preseli ben lake the uk have be and will continue to be an advocate for the international rule base order which be incredibly important we need to see those rule uphold by all and of course we will continue to advocate for that at the un in relation to all country we have be very clear about our position which be that it must be possible for people to return and agree with the hon member about the horrendous situation so many gazans be face which we have already talk about during this urgent question would just underline again what the prime minister say very clearly yesterday when it come to gazans return to their home and community they must be allow home the comment make by the president of the united states about riviera of the middle east undermine the hard work towards two state solution that as the minister have say be the only way to have last peace in the region can she confirm that it will be for the palestinian people to determine the destiny of their country be grateful to my hon friend for ask to confirm that it will be for the palestinian people to determine the future of gaza and absolutely we have be crystal clear on that indeed as state previously we have be work with the palestinian authority on this thank the minister for her answer during this urgent question let make it clear in the first instance that not have see the full detail of trump plan for gaza believe need to see more detail and think we should all look at that more astutely however very much want future for gaza that see barren wasteland of death and destruction become something of value with job an economy and safety israel need secure border that safeguard israeli citizen so that hamas terrorist murderer rapist and child killer can not murder israeli people we should remember that china and iran have stand alongside hamas will the minister consent to keep an open mind on dialogue with fresh approach to help those in israel and the gaza strip be sure that member across the house want to ensure that there be an economically viable situation in gaza in the future that be one of the many reason why commercial operation have to be allow to resume and it be really important that the government of israel enable that we of course need situation of security and sovereignty for gazans and all palestinians as say before as well as for israelis the hon member talk about economic empowerment and this issue have be crucial for the uk government as see for myself when visit palestinians in the west bank see some of the support that the uk have be engage in there and we will continue that work thank my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald for secure this important urgent question over the last month or so we have see palestinian people displace from their home and community on many occasion not just once but perhaps twice or three time so for the president of the united states to suggest far force displacement seem to to be not just illegal but incredibly cruel in diplomacy we believe that timing be everything so in order to give the palestinian people some protection from outside actor who seem to wish to dictate what should happen to they be it not now time for the international community and our government to recognise palestine as state and give it all the international support and strength that that would provide my hon friend be right to refer to the level of displacement as say previously of the population of gaza have be displace some two or three time and some up to nine time when we consider the impact on whole family of have to move so many time be sure we be all disturb by that she be right to say that timing be important of course it be which be why the uk government be consider this so carefully we must use the mechanism available to we to ensure above all that we get to two state solution and the peace that be the right of palestinians and israelis the devastation in gaza need strong international coalition focus on reconstruction humanitarian aid and pathway to negotiate two state solution with viable palestinian state not speculation about handing over territory and force displacement on humanitarian aid two piece of legislation have now come into effect that will ban unrwa operation in area under israeli occupation what action be the government take to prevent the large humanitarian aid operation in gaza from collapse with the devastating consequence that would have on palestinians my hon friend be right gaza recovery need will be vast and they be extremely serious the uk be engage with partner on assess those need and work together so that we can ensure that the unprecedented scale of destruction in gaza be remediate that will require innovative financing mechanism for example above all it must be process that be drive by palestinians my hon friend talk about unrwa and discuss that situation with the emergency relief co ordinator few day ago we continue to work with partner on this and the uk government position on unwra have be articulate number of time from this dispatch box we believe that it must be able to continue to operate let we be clear palestinian land belong to the palestinians and any implication that they should be force from it should be unequivocally condemn individual palestinians be routinely force from their land by illegal settlement building in the west bank will the minister join in unequivocally condemn illegal settlement building in the west bank yes and have see that activity for myself with the impact it have have on palestinians and their family the violence that have often accompany it and the economic damage it have do be well convinced of that as indeed the uk government have be they have state that many time business of the house will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business the business for the week commence february be as follow monday february second reading of the border security asylum and immigration bill tuesday february consideration of lords message to the water special measures bill lords follow by consideration in committee and remain stage of the arbitration bill lords follow by debate on motion to approve the draft neonatal care leave and miscellaneous amendments regulations and the draft statutory neonatal care pay general regulations wednesday february second reading of the data use and access bill lords thursday february general debate on history month the house will rise for the february recess at the conclusion of business on thursday february and return on monday february the provisional business for the week commence february will include monday february remain stage of the crown estate bill lords colleague may also wish to be aware that the business on wednesday march be expect to be an estimate day allot day this week we have see government who talk about growth but have prove themselves unwilling to support transformational investment at the astrazeneca plant in liverpool at the same time they appear keen to expand the sum be pay in relation to the chagos island to number some time large than that be consider for astrazeneca can see the degree of shame and embarrassment about that on the government benches and their concern that important city in this country be be deprive of local investment as result in business question on november raise the issue of the assist die bill and highlight host of procedural defect in the way it be be rush through the house by the government the bill be publish barely two week before the vote on second reading as the house will recall no impact assessment or legal issue analysis have be publish the promoter of the bill have circulate document purport to answer question but which actually leave host of important question entirely untouched those question include the bill impact on the medical profession and the relationship between medical staff and patient and the impact on the provision and regulation of the different drug and drug cocktail require the question include the involvement of the judiciary in the process and the balance of probability test for coercion that the bill propose it be not surprising that the bill be and be be oppose by the secretary of state for health and social care and the secretary of state for justice with the former saying do not think that palliative care end of life care in this country be in condition yet where we be give people the freedom to choose without be coerce by the lack of support available be sorry to say that the leader of the house respond to my remark in very patronising way suggest that it be somehow inappropriate and political for to raise these matter at all of course that be nonsense be not take and do not take position on the underlying issue the whole purpose of business question be to highlight and debate the passage of legislation through this house but the leader of the house defensiveness be itself reveal it show the extent to which the government be quietly and wrongly stand behind this private member bill if we fast forward two month what do we find supreme court justice have tell the bill committee that it be not clear what the judge role be suppose to be in this legislation they call the judicial protection largely illusory and echo many other legal expert in highlight the lack of capacity in the high court the government own chief medical officer specifically warn the bill committee that the nhs should not be rush into become what would amount to death service and say that most doctor would not wish to take part in the final stage of an assist dying process and emphasise the medical vagueness of the idea of qualify people as terminally ill we have hear about the serious potential for misdiagnosis through the horrendous case of peter sefton williams who be incorrectly diagnose with motor neurone disease and give as little as six month to live those be not my word they be testimony on the bill by lead expert from range of field all this have be make much bad by the rushed and secretive way in which the bill committee have be handle the membership be disproportionately weight towards supporter of the bill the schedule have be highly congested with back to back sitting that do not allow mps to prepare some of the session have be hold in private attempt have be make to prevent key institution such as the royal college of psychiatrists from appear in front of the committee at all the effect of all these measure be to impede and inhibit external and internal scrutiny and we now hear that the impact assessment will now not be publish before report stage all these thing be shocking attempt to undermine and short circuit the proper scrutiny of the legislation the leader of the house have say in term that the government be not support the legislation she should therefore have an undiluted interest in ensure that such an important and controversial bill be properly handle after all she more than any other be suppose to be the custodian of proper parliamentary scrutiny of legislation will she therefore now act to address these obvious failure or will she stick to her position that everything be fine and there be nothing to see here may start with couple of business question update after my hon friend the member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith ask to join she in congratulate bake off star dylan bachelet they both join this week to taste some delicious cake in my leader of the house office bake off dylan be not only an inspiration to young people from aylesbury can report that he have extremely good taste because he choose my lemon drizzle as the winner thank my hon friend the member for wolverhampton west warinder juss for come to see this week with copy of stone roses record after we have exchange nice word about revolver records in his constituency hope that hon member across the house can see that be open to nice invitation celebrate constituency and community this week mark history month which be chance for we to reflect and remember the contribution of the lgbt community and the discrimination that they still too often face the labour party be proud to be the party of equality have abolish section and introduce civil partnership the gender recognition act and the equality act among other thing turn to the remark of the shadow leader of the house first let take head on some of his misleading allegation about the process for the assist die bill as he be well aware the house agree by clear majority that the bill should proceed from second reading to committee that be the will of the house that committee be now convene and in an unprecedented procedure for private member bill it have be take write and oral evidence to begin with it will begin many week of line by line scrutiny of the bill which be again unprecedented it will be lengthy committee stage the make up of the committee as set out in the standing orders reflect the vote on second reading and the party make up of the house many would argue that its make up have be overly conscious of that as have say at the dispatch box on number of occasion while the government have neutral position on the principle of the bill we have responsibility to ensure that any bill pass by the house be workable and operable that be the role that we will play through the ministers represent the government on that committee it be extremely regrettable and ill advise of the shadow leader of the house to use his privileged position at the dispatch box to give such political one sided and misleading account of what be difficult technical important issue of conscience to the country and to the house on the day of the bill second reading and since think every colleague across the house perhaps apart from he have recognise that we and our procedure show themselves at their very good in debate that important matter the right hon gentleman could have use his moment at the dispatch box to mark another important anniversary it may have escape people notice but next monday will mark day since the leader of the opposition take office wonder how the right hon gentleman think that be go be not sure why he do not celebrate all her brilliant achievement perhaps it be because like the rest of her leadership they have go completely unnoticed oh no sorry we have learn few thing about the leader of the opposition we now know what she be against she be against maternity leave the triple lock abolish hereditary peer our child wellbeing and schools bill which will protect young people from abuser right and security for worker investment in the nhs and for lunch she have get couple of thing right she admit that her party make mistake in government indeed it do and accept that it have no plan for growth this morning despite say that there would be no new policy until she have finally come up with one gently advise the shadow leader of the house that until the conservatives accept that they get it badly wrong on immigration and that all their rhetoric and target in the last parliament be just hot air do not think that anyone will take the leader of the opposition idea seriously one hundred day be normally moment for reflection and consideration so he might want to reflect on that and agree that his party pick bit of dud as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on baby pregnancy to age have have the privilege over the past few month to meet leader from across society who have incredible passion and energy for government policy that relate to baby from pregnancy to age two will the leader

spokesperson draw the attention of the house to the register of my interest yesterday the secretary of state for housing communities and local government make statement to this house in which she say that she have agree to delay the local election in some area for one year must confess that be bit confused because my local council essex county council be one of those area the briefing paper for the extraordinary full council meeting of essex county council that take place on january state the leader be minded to support the proposal to postpone the election in order to maximise capacity for the transition process whilst note that this would lead to two or three year postponement that be rather long than the one year that the secretary of state announce yesterday essex county councillor be usually elect for four year term and postponement really cancellation of election for three year would extend their term of office by will the leader of the house grant debate in government time on the principle of democracy in the united kingdom first of all thank the hon lady for raise the issue of police community support officer in essex last week be sure that she and many colleague across

money available for neighbourhood police the hon lady raise the election that be now not go to happen in essex we set very high bar for the postponement of any election this year this be one year postponement in the case of essex it be so that the great essex mayoral authority can be establish the intention be for election for that mayoral authority to take place in may know that these change take time and can cause difficulty in local area but the devolution revolution that be come her way through those change will bring extra job growth well service well transport and more power to her community in essex hope she will welcome that welcome the prime minister recent comment about support and enable the expansion of nuclear power station in the uk through small modular reactor the science and technology be well prove but other aspect must be develop alongside include the provision of appropriate grade nuclear fuel and permanent solution for nuclear waste in recent day have meet

member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west meet group of hindus from bangladesh because of the atrocity in bangladesh raise the matter in business question and mr speaker allow an urgent question on the subject the follow week think it would be courteous of the minister to give statement to the house on what subsequent action she be take equally gently ask the leader of the house to ensure that when we ask question and she diligently write to departments we actually get answer to our question because both the quality and the length of time that it take to get question answer seem very poor at the moment thank the chair of the backbench business committee for as ever advertise his forthcoming business and for explain how estimate day work that be especially important for new colleague for whom the forthcoming debate will be the first such occasion hear his lobbying about the allocation of day which will take very seriously as always do especially in relation to

be sure you be aware madam deputy speaker and hope the leader of the house be that we be currently undergo digital refresh of computer equipment and laptop here in the house of commons be rather disturbed to learn that the equipment that be hand in be crush and send to landfill digital poverty be multifaceted issue that impact all aspect of life for young child educational platform can not be access job opportunity be hard to access because of job be only advertise online and for old people healthcare service and support information be all severely restrict without digital access therefore may we have debate on what we can do not just as government but this house too to increase access to the internet and the digital service that be essential to lift people out of poverty my hon friend raise the really important issue of the digital divide digital inclusion be vital more and more service be move to digital platform as we be in the digital age if they be not accessible to everybody then they be not able to serve everybody and we should absolutely address that be not aware of the particular issue he raise the digital hardware of the house not be wipe and reuse and instead go to landfill but will look at it immediately after business question and get back to he on what more can be do be hugely concerned my constituent be hugely concerned and the cheshire police force be hugely concerned about the rise number of serious sexual attack by those here illegally in this country and those who have be house in immigration centre in cheshire may we have debate on the rise risk in cheshire review of legislation to remove foreign offender and the risk assessment undertake on the threat pose by individual place in accommodation centre in cheshire thank the right hon lady for raise this issue be aware of some of the incident that have happen in cheshire and how alarming they must be for the local community and the local police force they be absolutely totally abhorrent and unacceptable in all those case she be right to say that there be range of issue that can be take far we have bring forward the border security asylum and immigration bill which will make return those who be here illegally and those who commit crime when they be here much easy we be make great stride on that we be take real action on violence against woman and girl ensure criminal sanction be appropriate and we be put more police on the street there be also particular issue with asylum hotel and the company that run they which will take up for she like much of the rest of the country we have housing emergency in rochdale with people on the waiting list and many many child live in temporary accommodation that be unfit for family life and cost the taxpayer fortune do the leader of the house agree that while the million of new funding in the budget for affordable and social housing be very welcome and long overdue we need debate in government time on the need for the come spending review to ensure more stable secure home like the council house that grow up in my hon friend be absolutely right hear the secretary of state for housing communities and local government my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner talk about this issue regularly she rightly make the point that council housing use to be see as the poor relation but these day it be actually luxury to get council house that be why as part of our target to build million new home huge boost in social and new council housing be absolutely at the heart of meet that target as he say have secure affordable home be the bedrock to successful life as the leader of the house will be aware the community infrastructure levy be requirement to make contribution towards essential infrastructure however in west berkshire waverley horsham and bracknell forest there be evidence that exemption that should have be give be not result in resident be charge incorrectly and then chase by debt collector for recovery of those fine will the leader of the house allow debate in government time to discuss that important issue will she also congratulate councillor jeff brooks the leader of west berkshire council who have so far refund to resident who be incorrectly charge be sorry to hear of the hon gentleman constituent who have be incorrectly charge and then chase down for those debt but be pleased to hear that some of that be now be put right know that there be debate in westminster hall on the regulation of the bailiff sector where he may want to raise some of those issue however will happily raise what he have mention with ministers and ensure that he get full reply like most mp one of my favourite thing be to visit school in my constituency recently be at sir graham balfour school in stafford where one of the student speak to passionately about how school sport and physical education benefit not only physical but mental health inspire by his campaigning will the leader of the house agree to debate on improve access to pe and sport in school thank my hon friend for mention the issue raise with she on her recent school visit pe not only play vital role in ensure our young people have access to broad curriculum that can help they well succeed in education but be critical to mental and physical health and to our preventive work and the government be commit to that be sure that the subject would make good debate be she to apply for one the deputy prime minister announcement yesterday be widely believe to herald not just the widespread cancellation of democratic election but the introduction of far more power for government to centralise decision making and impose it on local authority as well as massive reduction in the number of councillor represent local people in local authority and the abolition of whole tier of local authority for which the government have no electoral mandate and that be on the basis of putative saving for which there be no proof so the chaos of that reorganisation will have to be pay for by cut in public service when will the government provide full day debate on the proposal for devolution and local government reorganisation across the country on scale that we have not see for some year certainly that merit full day debate and vote at the end of it be sorry the hon gentleman do not welcome our real commitment to devolution ensure that local community have more power over the thing that affect they such as their local service transport economic development and join that up in way that provide strategic benefit to those area respect the hon gentleman but gently say that under the government that he support local government be absolutely hollow out after year and year of austerity with local council after local council go bankrupt month after month we have give record long term settlement to local government and alongside that we be unashamedly push power out to community we have have several statement

position on the pan euro mediterranean convention pem minister tell the today programme on january that the government be not seek to join pem later that day the right hon gentleman say that the government do not currently have any plan to join report january vol on january the chancellor of the exchequer say that the government be consider join pem but then on february the right hon gentleman say in answer to write question from the hon member for east londonderry mr campbell that the government do not currently have any plan would be grateful if he could tell we what the government position be and if he can not perhaps he would be good enough just to make up another one the opposition believe there should be no backsliding on free movement or compulsory asylum transfer we believe that no new money should be pay to the eu we believe that no reduction in our current fishing right should be give away we believe in no rule taking dynamic alignment or european court jurisdiction we believe in no compromise on the primacy of nato as the cornerstone of european security that be what the opposition believe it be time for the government to tell we what they believe future government will not be bind by bad labour deal thank the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for his contribution of course nato remain the cornerstone of our security that have be cross party position for decade he ask about plan and red line refer he to our manifesto which be put to the people last year that contain those clear red line of no return to freedom of movement the single market or the custom union he can see in that example of what the government be seek to negotiate the hon gentleman talk about negotiate international agreement there be many people from whom would take advice about international agreement but hope the house will forgive if the conservatives the party that manage to send hundred of million of pound to rwanda and all they get in return be send some volunteer and most of their home secretaries there be not at the front of the queue for give advice on how to negotiate international agreement give some credit to the leader of the opposition who strike markedly different tone on this issue from that strike by the hon gentleman today she admit freely that the last government leave without plan for growth and that frankly they end up make it up as they go along be surprised that the hon gentleman do not begin his remark by repeat that apology perhaps he have different view than the one take by his leader the hon gentleman talk about the jurisdiction of the european court of justice but he be part of government who negotiate role for the european court of justice in the windsor framework he talk about standard this government be commit to the high standard whether that be on product safety employment right or consumer right we believe in race to the top on standard not the race to the bottom that would be the dream of the conservatives as the government move forward our test be the national interest it be about make britain safe more secure and more prosperous there be another test for the leader of the opposition however see that she have put out social media video about test which be worth couple of minute for mild entertainment if nothing else the test for she be whether she will face down the ideologue in her party be she go to show some political courage and back the national interest or be she just go to back down in the face of the ideologue in her party on the basis of the hon gentleman contribution be not optimistic call the chair of the business and trade committee very much welcome the statement from my right hon friend but the reality be that he have inherit deal with the european union that have knock about to off our economic output each year certainly the business and trade committee hear in brussels last week clear message from the business community that we need to be as specific and as ambitious as we can be ahead of the reset summit with the president of the european commission what plan do the paymaster general have to bring together the british business community and indeed the trade union community so that the prime minister can go into his summit with president von der leyen clear minded about just how ambitious our wealth creator want he to be the chair of the select committee be entirely right about the involvement of civil society trade union and business be sure that he will have see the comment of the manage director of food at marks spencer only today who say we wholeheartedly support the government plan to negotiate veterinary agreement the benefit would be significant there be no discernible downside and we will offer whatever help we can to aid the negotiation there be time when the conservative party be on the side of business clearly no more call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of his statement welcome much of the statement content that the government be serious in their commitment to reset our broken relationship with the european union but what the liberal democrats want be action the european union be our close neighbour and large trading partner sense that the minister know that we have to get on with repair the trading relationship which be so badly damage under the former conservative government so please let we get on and do it the botched brexit deal have be complete disaster for our country especially for small business which have be hold back by ream of red tape and new barrier to trade cost our economy billion in lose export the minister talk of pragmatic negotiation surely what be pragmatic be to drop the government red line and agree new uk eu custom union it would be the single big step that the government could take to unlock growth and can not think of anything more pragmatic liberal democrats will continue to call on the government to do the right thing we be also disappoint by the home secretary comment at the weekend on rule out youth mobility scheme do that represent the government stance youth mobility deal would be good for our economy especially our tourism and hospitality sector while provide young british people with the opportunity to work and study abroad it would be win win not only that it be what the british public want new polling show that two third of the uk population be in favour of such scheme do the minister not agree that introduce youth mobility scheme be exactly the kind of pragmatic negotiation that the government should be prioritise be grateful as always for the contribution of the hon lady we have fine debate in westminster hall last week all would say to she about speed though be that this government be act on the red line in our manifesto around the single market custom union and freedom of movement on which we be elect and which deliver this majority last july look at the liberal democrats manifesto and its plan for the relationship with the european union and it contain four step if we be choose to do this in four different phase we would be move lot more slowly than we be at the moment so hope the hon lady will welcome the progress we be make know there be lot of speculation on the issue of youth mobility of course we consider sensible proposal in accordance with our red line but our position remain the same there be no plan for youth mobility scheme and we have be clear that there will be no return to freedom of movement guess should not be surprised to hear the conservatives try to defend an impossibly bad deal for british business which be why be so relieved that the grown up be go to europe and work out what be in the national interest may press the minister on something that it be very clearly in the national interest to resolve with our european partner national grid estimate that it will cost the uk exchequer billion to billion over this parliament to have differential emission trading scheme between we and europe pollution do not respect border and we all want to tackle the climate crisis can he confirm that resolve the issue around the carbon border adjustment mechanism will be on the agenda for the summit in may be grateful to my hon friend who know have campaign on this issue energy be very much priority for the discussion specifically the emission trading scheme and linkage the exist trade and co operation agreement commit the uk and the eu to consider that the minister rightly speak about the importance of nato which be key to our defence strategy however have real concern about the negotiation take place on the defence strategy and on work with the european union we on the nato parliamentary assembly have often speak about the role of pesco the permanent structured co operation and the procurement strategy different country procure different element can run into some constitutional problem which can be problem over generation of procurement and it be important that protocol be make now for how those two thing interact ask the minister not to sign up to european programme without ensure that we build in protocol so that pesco can not undermine article decision as it stand the ideology of pesco stand in the way of article decision if the minister would like to speak about this far would be happy to meet he would be more than happy to speak to the right hon gentleman acknowledge his expertise in these matter he refer to interoperability which be hugely important he will have see that the prime minister meet the secretary general of nato on monday that send out signal that nato remain absolutely fundamental it be the foundation stone of post war security and of our approach go forward what we seek to do will be complementary to nato to build on our collective strength in these dangerous time british business be clear that they want the government to cut paperwork tackle the trade barrier that they face and lower the cost of sell good and service to our trading partner in the eu the leader of the opposition say last week that the conservative government leave the eu without plan do the minister agree that that be typical of the chaotic economic management of the conservatives and that once again it be up to the labour government to clean up their mess my hon friend be absolutely right at least the leader of the opposition be candid about the chaotic decision make under the previous government together with our friend and neighbour in the eu we have over billion worth of trade it be clearly in our national interest to lower trade barrier pragmatically in that space be pleased that this government be move away from the ideological fantasy of the conservative government and take pragmatic approach to eu uk relation passive divergence do nothing when regulation move forward in the eu be increasingly concern for british business it lead to huge trade barrier in emission trading for example which be badly hurt the uk economy what do the paymaster general propose to do about passive divergence we be not do nothing there be area where this government will be in world lead space let we look for example at what we be do on employment right and product safety as indicate early to the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart the government believe in race to the top on standard not race to the bottom welcome the increase number of british officer now work with europol will the minister tell more about how we will work with our european partner to tackle transactional crime such as people smuggling and drug trafficking my hon friend raise an important point be pleased that we have already increase our national crime agency presence at europol the speed with which we can share datum be hugely important when crime be commit those early hour and day be so important for catch those responsible we want to work with the eu and international partner so that criminal have no place to hide on our continent those in the fishing industry will have note not only that the minister do not mention fish in his statement but that he do not respond to the question from the shadow minister my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart about fishing will he give an assurance to those in the industry that there will be no sell out whether on fishing ground quota day at sea and so on and that he will do absolutely nothing to worsen the industry the hon gentleman be right to mention fishing can tell he first and foremost that will engage with the fishing industry and its representative about the issue that they face particularly in sell into european market we will of course advocate for the interest of our fisher and ensure that we fulfil our legal obligation on the marine environment as result of the previous government bad deal company in my constituency tell about the impact that the barrier to trade with the eu be have on their business hit profit and affect job do the minister agree that it would be foolhardy for this government not to tackle those barrier and back british business my hon friend be absolutely right we speak to business and they want few barrier to trade it be astonishing that the modern conservative party do not seem to share that view welcome the minister statement on close co operation with the eu on defence and security but on the day the bank of england cut its growth forecast from to do the minister agree that the single big thing we could do to turbocharge our economy in the medium and long term be to form custom union with the eu we be elect on manifesto that set out clear red line but of course there be significant economic advantage not just to the united kingdom but to citizen all across europe in the reset that we be now look to take forward whether in make our citizen more prosperous or in make they safe and more secure that work will deliver for britain warmly welcome the minister statement be it nice to finally have government who want to work with rather than alienate our european partner in that spirit do he agree that there be chasm between the thin last minute deal that the previous government negotiate which the leader of the opposition now deride as deal without the red line that he and his government have set out that be the landing zone that hope the government will get to as soon as possible my hon friend be absolutely right the chaos of the previous government do extraordinary damage to this country on the international stage and frankly it sully our international reputation be pleased that the leader of the opposition at least understand the chaos that the conservatives cause our economy my hon friend be absolutely right this government take completely different approach we be elect on manifesto that we will now seek to deliver thank the minister for his answer to all our question he always reply in positive fashion as for my question he probably know what be come but will ask it anyway the thorn in the side of any restoration of good faith with the eu lie in the abhorrent northern ireland protocol and the eu grip on northern ireland that may well exclude northern ireland from any trade deal with the united states of america with which we already have multimillion pound supply deal in place will the minister confirm that allow northern ireland to have her place in the united kingdom and an end to the game that be hurt the people of northern ireland both financially and constitutionally be at the top of the agenda for good relation would like to reassure the hon gentleman that northern ireland be always at the forefront of my mind since come into office have visit belfast twice chair the inter ministerial group which obviously include the minister and deputy first minister of northern ireland and the windsor framework taskforce sit within the cabinet office so can assure the hon gentleman that the interest of the people of northern ireland be fundamental to this government would also suggest to he that successful negotiation of sanitary and phytosanitary agreement would be of significant benefit to the people of northern ireland welcome the paymaster general statement today notice that he say that there be currently no plan for youth mobility scheme with the european union as former erasmus student myself may urge he to look at the scheme that be already in place with country range from south korea to uruguay australia and new zealand and the immense cultural economic and societal benefit that come from those scheme which do not rub up against the government red line on single market access custom union membership or freedom of movement my hon friend make powerful point and if we look back over recent decade there have be many people in this house who have have the benefit of study abroad as my hon friend have also point to though the red line upon which this government be elect be fundamental thank the paymaster general for that statement backbench business coalfield communities order this be very well subscribe debate so there

for the leadership that they have show want to acknowledge professor steve fothergill and chris whitwood for the excellent work that they do support the labour group of coalfield mps group on which lead for the west midland some million people live in britain coalfield one in people in england and scotland and one in four people in wales but almost half of coalfield community be among the most deprived community in the united kingdom yesterday have very helpful discussion with tash and roshni from the local trust we talk through the figure in my community in cross heath knutton and silverdale where the challenge of tackle injustice and inequality be most serious for we locally just as it be serious in place across the country would be grateful if the minister touch on the community wealth fund and how we can ensure that money from it be direct at support disadvantaged neighbourhood where will the money go and how will it be allocate education have such an important role to play be at st thomas boughey school in halmer end last week and hear about the challenge that it face when it come to funding staff recruitment and retention and ensure that the smart young people who go to the school can work and live in and contribute to the community in which they be raise look forward to welcome some of those young people to parliament later this month my community have university keele university how do we build bridge between the funding that university can attract and young people who want to study in the community that they live in as my hon friend the member for neath and swansea east say we need justice for the british coal staff superannuation scheme member and have tell the prime minister this directly the bcsss have more than member who formerly work in the mining industry include number of my constituent in newcastle under lyme and have promise that will fight their corner urge minister to speed up effort to transfer the billion investment reserve in the bcsss to the member who earn it deserve it and need it as more and more former miner die each year that be important because significant number of bcsss member be require to transfer to the bcsss as we have hear if they have not be force to move they would have have access to their own money when this new labour government make the right call on the mps they deserve it and this government although they have be in power for only few short month must now get on with it will do whatever can to help as my hon friend the member for chesterfield say we want real action not empty word we want proper commitment not hollow promise and we want our community properly invest in not forget new government with majority of this size present we with an opportunity to finally get the settlement we need the focus my constituent deserve and the future my constituent have earn my hon friend be make an excellent opening speech on topic that be so important for all our community be sure that he be as shocked as be to learn of the severe health inequality in coalfield community the average life expectancy be around year less than the national average and around three year less than that in the south east for the north east it be even bad do he agree that for these community these health inequality be the long term legacy and that be why we need to ensure that coalfield community be properly support even in this day could not agree more with my hon friend who be correct be look forward to work with she to make sure that we get the progress that we all want to see up and down the country madam deputy speaker be mindful of your instruction but want to touch briefly on four issue that know many colleague will expand on and want to leave time believe it or not for everyone else to have their say first on worklessness common assumption be that unemployment however define be no long problem so far as the former coalfield be concern this simply be not true but the nature of the unemployment problem face community such as ours have change in the and in the wake of pit closure there be large number of people out of work on relate benefit these day as the department for work and pensions datum present in the state of the coalfields report show an exceptionally large number of people out of work be on other benefit across former coalfield community such as mine of all adult of working age be out of work on benefit the big number be those who be out of work on incapacity benefit there be just over people in that situation in former coalfield across the country and people in that group account for around one in nine of all adult of work age that go to the point make by my hon friend the member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson it reflect poor health mention health inequality in the house this week but also hide unemployment because in part of the country where good job be more readily available many of those with health problem or disability be able to secure such job estimate from sheffield hallam university point to real level of unemployment in the former coalfield that be double the rate in south east england which say everything that we need to know consequence of the shortfall in local job opportunity be reliance on commute to neighbouring area and far afield net out commuting from the former coalfield the balance between flow in each direction account for about people the job available in former coalfield also tend to be less well pay with of employ resident work in manual job compare with gb average of and just here in the capital it be important to note that the average hourly earning of coalfield resident be around low than the national average as we have hear we have serious work to do my challenge to those on the front bench be this we need strong policy focus on grow the local economy in former coalfield include by tackle high level of economic inactivity thank my hon friend for secure this really important debate would he agree that the example of nissan in the neighbouring constituency of my hon friend the member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson show that when high quality manufacturing job be put into former coalfield area people from those area be among the most widely respect workforce in the world global investor think that they be among the good workforce they can get the tragedy be that there be not more company like nissan in former coalmining area my hon friend be right those workforce be not just respect they be brilliant skilled smart and hard work they deserve the opportunity that he and my hon friend the member for chesterfield have note and that know all colleague in this house want to see my point about policy to tackle high level of economic inactivity lead to the next important issue when it come to improve government support for coalfield community which be local growth funding we all want to see our economy grow and the prime minister and the chancellor have my support in push that agenda but growth must be drive and share across all part of our united kingdom as the government prepare for the spending review urge those on the front bench to ensure that at the very least present spending be maintain the primary focus of local growth funding need to be economic development and regeneration drive by mix of investment in people as we hear from my hon friend the member for north durham luke akehurst in place in infrastructure and in business support the investment in our community should be fairly allocate on the basis of need not competitive bidding and there should be full and timely consultation on the allocation formula funding need to be allocate over long term than be the case under previous government the commitment in the budget to set five year capital budget to be extend every two year at regular spending review be welcome step the government intention to rationalise the number of local growth fund be also welcome because it make sense to allocate funding at the sub regional level at which most local economy operate some will be surprised to hear say this but in some way we need less government we need light touch in manage this vital funding the expertise knowledge and experience of local people and local leader include elect mayor the minister will enjoy my saying that for once should be respect and they should be give great discretion within broad framework set by the government will my hon friend give way will but be get the look already my hon friend have mention commuting and infrastructure follow on from the point make by my hon friend the member for north durham luke akehurst those thing be important in connect people from durham to job in washington at nissan and at other great company there such as rolls royce and bae systems do he agree that there have be under investment for year in the infrastructure that he be talk about and especially in transport infrastructure which make project such as the leamside line which our mayor of the north east support so important for create the connectivity that we need my hon friend be correct we be talk about less government as the minister know have some concern about local government reorganisation and look forward to speak to he about that in great detail that say call on all local leader in staffordshire to engage with the subject seriously respectfully and wisely as we have hear from intervention we need to focus on the livelihood of the many not the job and power play of the elect few turn to the coal industry social welfare organisation national body that should not be confuse with local miner welfare institute which be independent charity concern about ciswo have be air on several occasion by number of colleague have meet member of its board and its chief executive and it would be wrong for those concern not to be note in the debate urge the ciswo leadership to consider how they might well support local welfare scheme when they run into difficulty include look at recycle fund locally when land and property be sell off and at how ciswo might engage well with local authority to support regeneration initiative in former mining community the coalfields regeneration trust get to work in in response to recommendation make by the coalfield taskforce which be establish by the late lord prescott as we know lord prescott be lay to rest last week and acknowledge his service to our country the trust focus over the last year have be to support community live with the consequence of the rapid mine closure programme that take place from the onwards under the government of mrs thatcher it have invest hundred of million of pound reach over million people with community project and activity aim at improve health skill and employment opportunity it also support thousand of vital community asset and organisation between and the crt receive funding from the uk scottish and welsh governments for its work it continue to receive funding from the scottish and welsh governments although that have reduce in recent year but it no long get funding from the uk government that have have huge impact on its ability to deliver across england and result in significant reduction in its programme of support where the previous conservative government fail urge this new labour government to deliver urge ministers to look at sustainable long term and comprehensive package of funding for the coalfields regeneration trust will the minister arrange for my hon friend the member for easington and the coalfields regeneration trust to meet relevant minister at the early opportunity today want to honour the proud and rich history of mining in newcastle under lyme and north staffordshire region where generation of hard work man and woman carve out legacy of resilience determination and community want we to remember the huge potential and the brilliant people who deserve the high quality public service they deserve the investment and focus that our big city get and they deserve government who will never walk by on the other side this debate give we chance to reflect on the past and to invest in the future as we remember the miner who risk their life every day we acknowledge the role that they play in shape the industrial strength of my region and the nation as whole their sacrifice remind we of the value of hard work perseverance and the unyielding spirit of north staffordshire and our united kingdom we have responsibility to lead where they leave off and we have no time to waste refer member to my declaration in the register of members financial interests be miner from the age of until come to this place period of over year and also have connection with the national union of mineworkers it will be crystal clear from this debate that there be an absolute need to continue with support for the coalfield community whether that be the orgreave truth and justice campaign the pardoning of the sack miner ciswo fantastic charity that need complete and utter overhaul the mps or whether it be look again at the bcsss scheme the general social deprivation and poverty in the community or the coalfields regeneration trust those issue will be cover in much more detail by my hon friend but want to take the time have to paint picture and take people back to the proud past because we in the coalfield community be very proud of our past the community be build from the wage packet of the miner what we have lose be something we have to describe today as well as what we want back to fulfil that pride in our community and the people we proudly represent we be the people who fuel the industrial revolution and the community be savagely destroy by government drive by political ideology there be little that the colliery do not touch and when leave school there be pretty much full employment when the school open their gate the pit open theirs follow in the footstep of our forebear we feel like we be contribute to the wealth of the nation we really be contribute to the wealth of this nation and many pay the ultimate sacrifice in do so people be give the fine apprenticeship you could ever imagine qualification in work underground that could be transfer across the globe and training in skill that no piece of paper could ever quantify learn from the very good my education from the age of be from miner with huge intellect most be without single write qualification and write off as uneducated by people who should know well but these be absolute working class genius believe it do not stop at political debate the man who we look up to impart to we many life skill they teach we the value of work be talk about miner underground who teach the young generation come through about the value of work the value of contribute to our local community and the peril of step out of line the coalfield largely police themselves and if you get into trouble on night out you be in trouble when you go back to work employment at the pit give miner and their family the security of colliery house good quality terrace housing that

industrial northern town be promise nothing but empty slogan successive conservative governments ignore they neglect they and insult they but they refuse to be forget although kellingley be not in my constituency many mine like it be close in similar circumstance and with similar result right across ossett and denby dale can not help but imagine that the scene be similar on each occasion caphouse colliery in my constituency close in in that refusal to be forget the mine be convert into museum conceive create and now staff by ex miner it be run by lynn dunning who embody the often forget role of woman during the strike we must remember those who help heat our nation for generation with good old yorkshire miner take people down the shaft at the mining museum there be not well place to

anger at the arrogance and ignorance of previous government who decimate our community without thought for what would come next and determination to change this great injustice and to give our community not just what it need but what it have earn we do not need to just preserve the legacy of coalfield community we must also fight for the dignity of retire miner who make that proud legacy

green industry of the future to ensure that what happen to the mineworker never happen again we be committed to grow the economy in town right across our country and not just london as people in my area know all too well strong community must be nurture generation after generation but people in post industrial northern town such as mine often feel ignore and forget by the powerful it be my job in the house to ensure that those thought and feeling be hear be committed to never treat they with the same injustice they experience at the hand of uncaring short termist conservative governments be pleased that we have the opportunity to debate such important matter thank my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for secure the time and commend he on an excellent speech in the village and town that make up the wonderful constituency of airdrie and shotts common theme consistently arise when knock on door the memory of coalmining the community spirit and cohesion that exist and the suffering and devastation feel as consequence of the cruel tory policy of rapid deindustrialisation airdrie and shotts like other constituency we have hear mention sit at the centre of an industrial heartland in this case central scotland in such community young man and woman enter skilled employment in their own home town we be ask the government to support far the regeneration of coalfield community use modern educational and employment technique in the hope that that will become reality once again the work people of airdrie and shotts have be treat as an afterthought for too long they have be let down by conservative and snp governments who act in self interest rather than the interest of the nation be delighted that we now have government who will ensure that the people of airdrie and shotts can mark the legacy of its coalmine past but strengthen modernise and deliver more prosperous future in my family we remember my late grandfather jimmy stevenson who work down the pit for over year my late father in law drew mccracken who work in mine across central scotland for year scramble and dig in inch seam and who carry his brother up the mine after he be kill and my brother in law derek mccracken who work for year in the mine around plains and caldercruix we owe it to they and the other miner to create new future it often go unnoticed that the inequality face in former coalfield be staggering while there be many mean of measure the scale of challenge face former coalfield find particular interest in figure provide in the state of the coalfield it highlight that ayrshire and lanarkshire which be analyse together for the purpose of the report be the joint low area for job for people of work age with employee job for every working age people indeed ayrshire and lanarkshire witness an above average out of work benefit claimant rate and be identify in the report as area where extensive deprivation exist that be direct consequence of year of tory government they deepen the inequality that have scar constituency such as mine for decade however scotland as whole be country where health inequality be feel on an unimaginable scale where the inequality be deep and divisive in equal measure and where there be no bad time to be poor and in need of healthcare with one in people in airdrie and shotts alone in bad or very bad health the former coalfield that represent be hold back by ill health because of scottish government who have allow nhs waiting list to soar almost one in six scot be wait wait and wait there be no doubt that the challenge face my constituent be significant there be social and economic barrier because government have not undertake anywhere near enough work to break they down but firmly believe in the potential of airdrie and shotts and its people it be constituency with skilled worker talented young people full of potential and an old generation who remember its industrial and coalmine past while want the good for its future thank the coalfields regeneration trust for the work it do to raise awareness of the struggle face in constituency such as airdrie and shotts must also thank the uk labour government for deliver budget that see scotland receive its large funding since devolution and pay rise for work people across my constituency look forward to work with the minister and other to regenerate former coalfield and constituency such as mine encourage the government to work closely with the coalfields regeneration trust which do excellent work in our community as we embark on plan for change away from the year of social economic and health barrier block the progress of our former coalfield community first pay tribute to my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for secure this important and timely debate echo his comment about our hon friend the member for easington grahame morris for his work champion our coalfield community which until this government be elect have be forget speak as the proud daughter of former coalminer on behalf of the coalfield community in amber valley and thousand of former coal industry worker across the country my dad and the constituent of amber valley have common link rich mining heritage whether it be constituent like john edwards from heanor colin smith from langley mill or ian walker from ripley all part of amber valley share this common bond our community be build on the hard work and dedication of our mineworker engineer technician and support staff who power our nation through challenging time often at great personal risk in october we see long overdue justice serve for the member of the mineworker pension scheme when the government agree to return its billion investment reserve that decision result in well deserve increase in pension and an average increase of week for each member that be already improve the life of many of the former mineworker in amber valley it have directly benefit my family too and know that it mean lot to my dad to get that recognition however the same can not be say about the member of the british coal staff superannuation scheme the hard work of those engineer technician and support staff ensure that man like my dad who go down the pit every day return safely to the surface indeed some member of the bcsss also work underground we have do right by the mps man who go down the pit but have we truly support the woman who be often pay less than their male counterpart and be an equal part of the coalfield community as my hon friend the member for neath and swansea east carolyn harris point out woman in the coal industry the majority of whom be bcsss member deserve pension justice too the parallel between the mps and the bcsss be obvious both scheme be establish during the privatisation of british coal in with the government act as guarantor yet while the mps member have see their investment reserve rightly return bcsss member such as my constituent john colin and ian continue to wait the trustee of the bcsss have formally request the return of the billion investment reserve that request be not only reasonable but consistent with the precedent set by the mps decision this be matter not just of financial contribution but of justice fairness and honour the contribution of all those who help build our nation energy infrastructure urge the government to act swiftly and decisively let we commit to full review of the bcsss surplus share agreement and transfer the investment reserve to its rightful owner the scheme member that action would provide significant boost to the pension of more than former coal industry staff enhance their financial security and quality of life in retirement urge the government to consider quick action as many in receipt of those pension be in their or old it be heartbreake that thousand of miner include colleague of my dad do not live long enough to receive the benefit of the mps surplus know my father would not want his colleague who keep he safe and support he to be forget urge the government to consider right this historic inequality so that all member of our coalfield community get the justice that they deserve it be an honour to speak in this debate as the member of parliament for cannock chase an area deeply proud of its mining heritage colliery be our dominant industry from the century right up until the early congratulate my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee on secure this debate and enable we to speak on behalf of our coalfield community as fellow staffordshire mp know that he be dedicated advocate for the town and village that he represent he refer to the diglake mining disaster in cannock chase on october we will mark the anniversary of the grove colliery disaster in the north lanes area of norton canes which claim the life of man my constituent be rightly proud of where they live often generation remain in the area for their whole life which show the real sense of community and local identity however my constituent often tell that we desperately need investment in the bread and butter infrastructure that support thrive community such as capacity at gps dentist and primary school good quality road and regeneration of our town centre regeneration be vital because in all too many coalfield community there be still feeling that decade on we have not all recover from the rapid destruction of the coalmine industry in the and at the general election many of my constituent be tempt by the siren song of level up from the then prime minister my constituent have be cry out for the promise of big bang regeneration across community such as mine for very long time our main town of cannock be successful in secure million from the levelling up fund in but the reality of the fund have be far more complex than even my local council envisage four year ago first of all its rigidity in award funding to one town pit community against one another and do not reflect the more balanced approach to regeneration that council such as mine would take if give the freedom secondly the focus on large complex and therefore risky project with fix budget couple with high inflation have force council with luf project to repeatedly re evaluate what they can deliver on several occasion members will have hear raise the plight of the prince of wales theatre in cannock and the museum of cannock chase in hednesford which be threaten with closure the museum base in the building of the former valley colliery be loved hub for our proud mining heritage our theatre be play its part in keep our heritage alive too such as in the new play the tunnellers which tell the story of the heroic man of the tunnel company in the first world war many of whom work on the cannock chase coalfield redevelopment of our theatre be to be at the heart of our luf project but the effect of inflation to have force the council to scale back the project and the theatre be now set to close fortunately fantastic group of resident have form community interest company with view to take on the prince of wales pay tribute to they and as state at public meeting that organise last friday will continue to work shoulder to shoulder with they to secure bright sustainable future for the theatre and our museum too very much hope that our council will use the levelling up fund to help secure the long term future of the theatre the difficulty face by cannock luf project underline the flaw of the funding model be encourage to see this government commitment to replace the dog eat dog bidding war with system base on need and what our community want alongside my colleague hope to see coalfield community benefit from local growth funding maintain at the current level at least long term funding that do not lead to rapid dash to spend by arbitrary deadline and the genuine empowerment of local council which will always know their community well than whitehall finally the coalfields regeneration trust which have do fantastic work in our community for year be force by the previous government to become self finance charity despite the inevitable scaling back of its capacity to invest its brilliant model of generate income from build new industrial unit for small and medium sized business in coalfield community be enable it to carry on its fantastic work the crt objective and investment perfectly align with this government ambition for economic growth that be spread right across the country while bear down on the barrier that all too often affect coalfield community more than most our community which once power the nation be burst with potential and passionate hard work people with diverse range of skill and

election be delighted that swift action be take to return the investment reserve to its rightful owner like my hon friend the member for neath and swansea east carolyn harris believe that the bcsss be worth review it share many of the same characteristic as the mineworker pension scheme and have equally deserving member particularly want to highlight the nearly woman in the mining industry the majority of whom be in the bcsss they be often among the low pay in the mining industry but their contribution should not be overlook they deserve the same financial security and recognition in later life as their male colleague the minister have state that the government will review the bcsss after the arrangement with mps trustee have be agree be so appreciative that the government be open to explore the scheme be contact daily by constituent desperately ask for clarity on the process hope that discussion will take place soon but more directly be call for transparency on timescale so that

to persuade they to open the coalmine the hon member intervention be perfectly time because be about to say that it be in these community that the easy soundbite of populist can take hold will answer his question in time our response must be economic revival in coalfield community that can generate renew sense of purpose and pride the cynical promise of the last government to my constituent be that they would reopen coalmine that they know would likely never come they tell my community that the good it could hope for be job in die industry job that would be tie to export volatile commodity that lack domestic market my job and the government job be to put other option on the table have produce an industrial plan for west cumbria and since the election have commission and update more

when man and boy work in durham mine be long and slow that decline take place over long period and so do the economic damage that come with the closure of the mine one of the most tragic policy to exacerbate the suffering of the community in county durham be the concept of category village be deliberate decision not to invest in they and to run they down quite few village in my constituency be condemn in public policy term in that way and local people fight for the survival of their community my fundamental concern be that even now so long after the closure of the last mine in sacriston in my constituency in the there have be very little systematic repurposing economically in those area level of poverty and deprivation be still far too high some of the economic activity that be intend to replace coalmining have in turn be shut down such as the ever ready factory at tanfield lea pay tribute to the crt for the excellent work it do in community like mine support job and local economic growth it support grassroot voluntary community and social enterprise organisation in north durham it have submit proposal to the government for more capital funding to help it expand its vital work

group in collaboration with the industrial communities alliance present an ambition statement which outline key proposal for the upcoming spending review among the proposal be call for funding allocation formula that more accurately reflect the true need of our community and call for great devolution of power to local leader after all we have already make significant stride with our greater manchester mayor andy burnham and the long await bus reform the proposal be relevant not just to former coalfield area like mine they speak to all disadvantaged part of our nation funding must be allocate fairly and base on need not through competitive bidding process that disproportionately benefit already affluent area local growth funding must have one clear and overarch focus economic

high than the national average there be brain drain from coalfield community many young people move away to study and never return the situation be particularly dire in area of my constituency the number sadly speak for themselves in the coalfield community of ayr carrick and cumnock there be only job per resident of work age and one in four people claim out work benefit one in claim the personal independence payment or disability living allowance and one in three have no qualification one in people be in bad or very bad health however every week see at first hand the positive impact that the coalfields regeneration trust have in my community for example it be deliver and develop after school and breakfast club in drongan to address child poverty and support family it be also look to replicate that in small coalfield village call dalrymple much more need to be do with the support of the uk government will work with colleague to make the case to the ministry of housing communities and local government for increase funding for project that focus on our community wealth building model unlike previous government we need to leave lasting and positive legacy for our coalfield community we need to end the left behind legacy once and for all mining have long be deeply weave into the practical and cultural fabric of people live in chesterfield as it have in all mining community need only look out of the window of the labour club where base my constituency office to be confront with the former derbyshire miners association office and the statue of chesterfield first two miner mp indeed until the election of tony benn in every member of parliament for chesterfield in the century have be former collier my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery speak about the educational role of the national union of mineworkers that be one of the many legacy that have be lose as coalmining have disappear the union have real commitment to make sure that its member be educate to the high standard evidence of mining in chesterfield and derbyshire range from tragic memorial to miner lose in our various tragedy to the dwindle number of miner welfare club and former office on saltergate they serve as reminder of the past window into time when the region be dominate by the pit and the opportunity that they provide it be important however that this debate also focus on the future for coalmining area and on investment such as the investment in junction secure by my former colleague dennis skinner it mean that more people be now employ on the old markham pit site than ever work underground there this timely debate remind we that the former coalfield area cruelly put out of use by the industrial vandalism of the thatcher government have never be satisfactorily repurpose in any strategic way by subsequent government the coalfields regeneration trust recently reflect on the impact on health not just for those with an industrial legacy but for the one in five people in my constituency who be out of work due to long term sickness the same proportion have no formal qualification those statistic paint picture of what can happen when industry retreat from an area and no plan be make for what happen next have hear former conservative mps talk about benefit culture but who create that it be of course the thatcher government put all those miner out of work and expect they to go on to incapacity benefit the coalfield be fight back however pay tribute to john burrows the former derbyshire num president and leader of chesterfield borough council for six year and his successor tricia gilby they be successful in attract million in town deal fund from the previous government and the dedication and success of the staveley town deal board of which have be proud member for the last five year have bring about welcome investment that will support staveley to support itself through the regeneration that we need however agree with colleague that what we need be not occasional little pot of money but long term strategic plan for re energise coalfield community they be very different from city which government tend to find it easy to get investment into we desperately need the new government industrial strategy to speak to the need of constituent like mine and to set out thought through plan for coalfield community see real opportunity for coalfield to be at the vanguard of the green revolution the government clean power by mission alone will unlock billion of investment year and create thousand of skilled job the coalfield have keep the light on in this country over the last century and there be so much opportunity for they to be at the forefront of do that again the people of chesterfield have proud history of work hard to keep the light on and they can keep that noble tradition go thank my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for arrange this debate we share an office so know how important this issue be to he and how frequently he speak about the need for regeneration in coalfield community that is when he be not argue with my staff about how old he look laughter newdigate keresley baddesley birch coppice and daw mill colliery provide job for many in my community until they close be proud to have grow up and live in coalfield community that retain many reminder of its mining history for many year play tennis at the grove in atherstone which be former miner welfare club have also walk through the miners welfare park in bedworth and take part in the weekly parkrun my grandfather be miner and like many other mineworker in the constituency he live in dordon which start off as just row of house until birch coppice pit open coal mine bring opportunity to countless people and many of my constituent work hard underground in dangerous condition throughout their life it be therefore crucial they get the pension they be entitle to deal with the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme mean that former mineworker in my constituency now have the pension they deserve we must do the same for those member of the bcsss such as the year old former miner who call my office today like many other coalfield community my constituency be still suffer from deprivation that be intensify by the mine closing the state of the coalfields report reveal that there be substantially few job in former coalfield than in most other part of the country unfortunately that be true in my constituency too with only job per resident of work age the problem that cause can not be overstate one in people be in bad or very bad health one in five be economically inactive due to long term sickness and one in four have no qualification by work with local business and school be determined to break that cycle and to ensure that people in my area have local employment opportunity and leave school with qualification that allow they to take up those opportunity otherwise my constituency will continue to follow the same pattern that many other coalfield community face where people must leave the constituency for work and our town and high street suffer as result be therefore here today to urge the government to take further action to tackle the disadvantage and worklessness face by coalfield community and to ensure that we hold ourselves to our promise to deliver the opportunity that our young people desperately need thank my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for secure this debate and my many hon friend for their outstanding contribution this afternoon clackmannanshire have proud mining heritage and like so many other place around the uk the pit be at the very heart of many local community it be somewhere that be more than workplace it be generational employer where comradeship and trust be the thing that brave worker who go underground and put themselves in danger to keep the country warm and move rely on be proud that the government announce that the entirety of the mineworker pension scheme would be hand over to ex coalminer and their family hundred of my constituent will benefit and the positive noise come from ministers about the bcsss be welcome clackmannanshire be like other heartland that have be deindustrialise the economic and social consequence of industry close odd year ago be still be feel today our young people face the challenge of find local employment of the kind that will pay wage that will allow they to contribute to the economy to participate in society and one day perhaps to buy house and raise family in comfort naturally that be the case there have be an exodus of young people mean that talent and potential leave local community my inbox tell the tale of the social devastation that be commonplace in deindustrialise area addiction issue health problem inadequate transport link high suicide rate and people rely on emergency food parcel just to survive all point to government failure to tackle deindustrialisation and the inequality that it produce if the and be the decade in which industry and manufacturing leave community like mine the be the period when austerity rule austerity be an assault on the poor the most disadvantaged and the most vulnerable in our society now we see reduction in opportunity negative social mobility low wage employment the gig economy community across the country ravage as leisure centre close and an unrelenting attack on the public service that be the very fabric of our community then of course we have pandemic whose true death toll can never be accurately calculate inequality have become even bad because of covid and inequality be very real killer yesterday my constituency be yet again the victim of industry leave when the worker at the grangemouth refinery be serve their redundancy notice on site more than highly skilled worker will lose their job and when we factor in the wide supply chain there will be nearly job loss like the coal industry vital energy creator will be lose forever different decade different government nevertheless strikingly similar social consequence will be the result let finish on more positive note with capital investment of million over five year the government have the chance to give the coalfields regeneration trust an opportunity to help to partly reindustrialise coalfield community that would create thousand of job our community need to be invest in not forget and consign to history as somewhere that use to have industry our community deserve an awful lot more than that last weekend when be out door knock in eckington one gentleman tell of his frustration with politic and his disbelief that it would ever achieve anything for he have to admit that be sometimes frustrate by this attitude because do not believe that the answer be never to try but be none the less mull over exactly why he have give up so much also last weekend go to an exhibition and talk organise by woman to show what they have do to support the miner like many member of my generation who grow up after the strike be aware of they but as with so much work class history we be never teach about they at school it be therefore huge privilege to hear janet and kate give such fascinating talk about the huge role that they have play and about the sheer strength of the mining community who have fight so hard to support each other during this period how little they have but how much they share it be clear that the root of my constituent apathy do not lie just in the past year of conservative impose national decline but go all the way back to the miner strike when the british government say we will take your job away and there be nothing you can do about it get on your bike we be not interested you be on your own if the government in westminster do that to you why would you ever look at they again the fact be that the closure of the mine do not just remove employment but show huge contempt for area such as north east derbyshire and rip the heart out of the social cohesion of community we in labour know when we come in that we have to deliver for those community one of their big champion be the late john prescott and applaud his work in establish the coalfield task force and then the coalfields regeneration trust which have be do excellent work ever since however despite the general rise in living standard that we deliver along with an improvement in the nhs and huge push for aspiration we could not close the gap between our coalfield community and other place and what work we do achieve be rapidly slash by the coalition government and many tory government after that let just say as an aside how disappointing it be when see so many of my labour colleague in the chamber to note how few representative of the conservative party be present and how few representative of small party such as reform who profess to care my message to my constituent in eckington and to everyone else be that be not go to give up fighting for they and for the step change in opportunity that be so desperately need in north east derbyshire and know that have hundred of colleague in the labour party with in that fight in community like mine we do not need charity we just need the tool to build our own future and then we will just get on and do it we need infrastructure so that we can access job customer market and education that be why be campaign for the staveley bypass to well connect staveley barrow hill and mastin moor that be why be campaign for more bus and well bus so that so people in killamarsh can get to work on time when work start at am remarkably the first bus be too late for that that be why be campaign to make well use of our exist rail link so that dronfield town of do not just have one train an hour to sheffield it be minute train ride and we have one train an hour it be ridiculous that be why be campaign to explore bring light rail back to community across north east derbyshire to connect we from clay cross and killamarsh to place such as chesterfield and sheffield it be about the social infrastructure that we have lose as well we need youth facility to show early on that our government care about young people we need support for our high street so that they can be the heart of our community we need to crack down on petty crime and antisocial behaviour so that we can feel safe we need our rural road to be safe so that we do not see family devastate by loss underlie this be the vital work that the government have already start on fix our nhs improve our school and grow our economy for my constituent in north east derbyshire be fight for our government to give they the tool they need and we will put in the hard work together to build well future we have do it before and know we will do it again be very pleased to support the application from my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee to secure today debate and congratulate he on do so my constituency be home to the proud former coalfield community of astley and mosley common which share with my neighbour my hon friend the member for leigh and atherton jo platt with other many part of my constituency also historically link to the mining industry for generation the astley green and mosley common colliery be cornerstone of the local area provide thousand of job economic stability and focal point for the community the local mineworker be quite rightly respect for the tough dangerous and essential work they do day after day down the pit pay tribute to the great work carry out by the volunteer who run the lancashire mining museum in my constituency which have have the pleasure of visit on number of occasion occupy the old astley green colliery site the museum illustrate just how central the mining legacy be to the area identity we must ensure that the sacrifice make by mineworker and their community to power this country be never forget the colliery in my constituency be close more than year ago however the impact on the local area linger today former coalfield community still suffer from shortage of good quality job high level of deprivation and bad health outcome the state of the coalfields report show that on average hourly earning in the former coalfield be still to below the gb average and it find that the overall out of work claimant rate be percentage point above that of south east england it be clear that the coalfield face share set of structural issue and challenge after year of undelivered promise on regional inequality from the party opposite although there be not many of they opposite we at the moment our coalfield community will now finally benefit from government who genuinely want to level they up legislation such as the employment rights bill will positively impact our former coalfield make work pay by deliver the big upgrade to worker right in generation welcome the government decision in the autumn budget regard the mineworker pension scheme long overdue decision that will see retired miner finally get the money they deserve however more can and should be do the reinstatement of government fund to the coalfields regeneration trust in support of their community wealth building model would provide much need stimulus to promote local growth feed into this labour government mission to secure growth and deliver rise living standard for work people to support our coalfield community in the future we must ensure we do not forget their share past there be many lesson to be learn from their experience particularly as we build the green industry of the future never again should community be neglect and abandon by the government as they be in the adapt industry to the future can take many form my constituency be home to the iconic eccles protector lamp despite no long have mine protector lamp be still produce in my constituency and repurpose for more than year they have carry the olympic flame traditional skill repurpose and put to continue work the scar leave by pit closure have never fully be address their damaging legacy continue to reverberate to this day the need for new and continued support from our government be clear that be the least our proud coalfield town deserve declare my interest as voluntary director of nursery that be run from venue support by the coalfields regeneration trust it be good example of the wide impact of investment in our coalfield thank my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for secure this important debate and for all his hard work to drive this issue forward nuneaton first shaft be sink in the and the last pit daw mill close in after year of service of man go into the darkness to keep the light of the nation on and the army of people work around they to support they and the industry know that they be delighted by this new government rapid progress on resolve the dispute over the mineworker pension scheme and very much look forward to similar progress and update from the minister on the british coal staff superannuation scheme be proud to live in coal village it be strong and vibrant community and my constituent understanding of the sacrifice make by so many be embed in our town collective history and consciousness the pit closure leave vacuum and legacy of social economic and health challenge which to this day have an incredible indelible impact on my constituency the people of nuneaton earn around week less than our neighbour and the national average people in nuneaton die young and live less healthy life and child in nuneaton leave school less qualified datum from the office for national statistics show similar trend to those mention by other colleague our young people choose to leave nuneaton and the devastating impact of poverty be still feel by far too many family and child these challenge be compound by complex historical infrastructure decline it have take year of fighting to ensure that daw mill restoration order will be deliver issue such as share sewer and drain land contamination and unadopted road mar our beautiful village and estate erode pride and leave we feel forget and unloved pat from new arley have be almost housebound for year she have to be carry on to the pavement because the unadopted service road the arley back by her door be in such poor state that it be dangerous for she to use her wheelchair and scooter she have difficulty attend hospital appointment or see friend these issue have be present for year and stick plaster investment and quick win will not solve they rectify the widespread disrepair be no quick fix these abandon service road invite antisocial behaviour drug and theft they be relic of forget time when we have weekly coal delivery and they cause many issue and lengthy delay for our utility fix water leak overhead cable and supply take much long than it should because of complexity it can take day just to identify who be responsible for the land and to gain access more support be need to rebuild complex capital programme and to work with highway authority to adopt and maintain these area to prevent they from become forget wasteland yet new estate with similar issue and unadopted road continue to be build we appreciate the investment we have see from the coalfields regeneration trust in nuneaton which have support project like the one to tackle long term health issue by instal community cardiac facility in camp hill the power of our community and the ability to thrive in our coalfield community be dependent on support nationally call the liberal democrat spokesperson be proud to represent several former coalmine community abercraf cwmtwrch gwaun cae gurwen ystradgynlais pontardawe and rhos be just few of the proud former mining community that represent therefore thank the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for secure this debate across wales nearly people about third of the population live in former coalmining town and village and be very proud to come from welsh mining family will never forget my grandfather take to see his father grave in maesteg cemetery his father die aged after work up to his waist in ice cold water for several hour the man and woman of our coalfield community make huge sacrifice to power this country so it be right that we be discuss the future of their community today to cut long story short welsh mining community have be leave behind by successive government margaret thatcher policy the closure of our major industry in wales and the failure to replace it with anything else have leave last scar it be not hard to see why people in south wales wonder whether their government be listen to they this parliament be an open goal for the government to repair the damage do by thatcherism the conservative party squander many of its year in power carry on with london centric banker friendly form of growth that mean young generation have to leave for the city as my mum do year ago this government must not repeat the mistake across the former south wales coalfield the economic reality be dire wage be low than the national average job growth be sluggish and unemployment remain high in fact in the south wales coalfield there be just job for every working age people nearly people third of the entire population of wales live in those area which be why they be so important to the welsh economy wales be head poor than england and fix our former coalmine community be key to fix the welsh economy coalfield community deserve to be at the forefront of economic renewal people in coalfield community want the government to show they that they matter they be desperate for change with splintering geopolitical order we need strong manufacturing base to keep ourselves safe and there be many excellent manufacture company in my constituency recently those from one such company that make vintage motorcycle part come to see they be currently have big problem export those part to europe which be directly affect the business and employment in my constituency that be why it be so important that the government do everything they can to repair our trading relationship with the european union be concerned that after year of fail promise from the conservative government to level up the very idea of level up seem absent from labour plan just last week the chancellor announce infrastructure project in the south east of england while the swansea valley which represent have be leave off the map for the south wales metro project it will be almost the only valley in south wales not to have trainline the people of the swansea valley deserve to have railway line again too it be time we invest properly in these community and give they the opportunity to thrive once again know from first hand experience that community in the coalfield be resilient and industrious there be unique opportunity open up to bring back job to our area let we take the global centre for rail excellence in onllwyn which straddle my constituency that technology testing facility locate on the site of former coalmine could bring new job and manufacturing back to the swansea valley but it need the government energy and money behind it public service especially healthcare also need urgent attention the health impact of mining have leave last legacy we must ensure that these community receive the care they need as we work toward more sustainable future while the economic issue face these community be vast many local resident also live with distinct fear in wales and across the uk the aberfan tragedy of be sear into the collective memory of our nation yet for many community across south wales the risk remain coal tip across the uk be still in need of remediation the reality be that the risk of tip collapse be increase due to climate change and more frequent intense rainfall in my own constituency primary school near pontardawe be force to close in due to fear of landslide the child be still be teach in temporary cabin in car park which be completely unacceptable many community in my constituency feel similarly abandon in gwaun cae gurwen resident of twynrefail place have be fight for year for neath port talbot council to adopt their road but that have not happen the road be in such bad condition that the resident be concerned that they will barely reach their own front door although be glad that labour allocate million in funding during the autumn budget to help remediate coal tip in wales it be far cry from the over million that the welsh government have say will be need to make these tip safe for future generation finally wish to turn to the issue of miner pension the british coal staff superannuation scheme currently have more than member across the uk as many member have already mention include in wales and in my constituency unlike their former colleague in the mineworker pension scheme member of the bcsss do not have their pension unfrozen by the government in the budget for many of these former miner time be run out six miner in the bcsss die every day due to health complication relate to mining many fear that they will not live to see resolution to this injustice that be why the government must act quickly time be not with the miner or their family will the minister confirm today when the government will give these miner and their family the pension that they work for if the uk government want to address inequality and prompt economic recovery across south wales they must start by invest in coalfield community family such as mine have suffer the consequence of community be leave behind we can not afford to let this continue for future generation our community in south wales be strong resilient and ready to succeed they just need the opportunity to do so call the shadow minister add my congratulation to the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee on secure this debate the house will know that ruislip northwood and pinner be not coalfield constituency our mining tradition be far old it go back to the day of chalk its legacy today be see in the impact of sinkhole in the local area today debate be very much focused on the last legacy and impact of an era when coal be king although do not represent coalfield constituency certainly grow up in one the old man with the blue scar and the hack cough from emphysema or pneumoconiosis as we now know it to be be the background to my childhood feel lucky that have great grandfather who unlike many miner live very long life he start work in pit at cwmcarn at the age of and carry on to the age of he share the impact of thing such as the universal colliery disaster in senghenydd on his life and the community in which he live and grow up and of see his brother die after be bury in rockfall although the industry create the enormous economic opportunity that have be describe by many member we know that the environment be very harsh and difficult and as we recognise in our many debate about climate change and the transition to net zero it create product that although valuable and effective at generate energy be enormously pollute be grateful to the shadow minister for give way we have just have very good debate but it must be considerable embarrassment to he that not single member of his majesty opposition think that it be worthwhile attend to make substantive speech appreciate that he be not coalfield mp and appreciate that not many conservative members be but do he not think that if the conservatives be serious about be ready to represent the whole country again we should be hear from some of their mp in debate such as this as we see in all the debate that we have in this house members will attend to represent the interest of their community and constituency know that the same point have be make in the past about the lack of member of parliament from certain party attend debate on farming and thing such as that we need to recognise that the central focus of this debate be on the historical impact and the way that we deal with that legacy as the hon gentleman have highlight there be to my regret not many conservative members of parliament who be deal with those issue in their constituency that be political fact however we will see they very active on issue that directly impact their constituency on daily basis gently say to the shadow minister that any party that seek to lead our united kingdom should be interested in and commit to issue that affect people across the uk irrespective of whether member have particular challenge in their constituency more of the shadow minister colleague should have be here be sure the government will wish to press that point in sum up it be important first to recognise the impact that the end of the use of coal in british industry and energy generation have have and secondly to draw out of that history some lesson for what be often term the just transition the intended end of oil and gas as significant player in our energy industry of the future when be grow up the thatcher government engagement on investment be largely with the european economic community see the road be build and the blue flag appear all over as the government seek to bring in infrastructure investment to open up place like cwmcarn valley off valley which be challenge to access and community of coal board house where my sister and her husband still live to this day so that people could access the grow industry and employment opportunity of the future the government at that time recognise that the infrastructure to create that access would be vital must take issue with that serve number of year on easington district council and we be twin with similar mining area in north westphalia in germany when the carl alexander mine near baesweiler close the local authority and the miner be give two year notice grant be make available through the federal local and national government to retain the miner and new industrial estate be build it be interesting to compare that with what happen when our pit close in easington murton south hetton horden and blackhall we find out on the friday that the pit be close on the monday and thousand of man lose their job remember those debate of course as the backdrop to my experience grow up along with the miner strike and the various intervention that occur there be an opportunity will put it this way to learn lesson from that and ensure that the new government approach and future government approach take those into account and handle those situation well if we could move forward from the event of the in the last parliament the conservative benches be full of member represent former mining constituency include three of the constituency in county durham perhaps the reason those members be not return at the last general election be that government sorry failure to deliver the levelling up they promise can the shadow minister in any way defend the failure to economically regenerate mining area that in have conservative mp for the first time be sure that all those former member of parliament and indeed some of their labour predecessor would also be happy to answer for the work they do some of which be successful and some of which be not to bring new job opportunity and educational chance to those community there be many thing we can debate that have bring benefit to those community if we examine the statistic in the library briefing on the impact and legacy in different coalfield around the uk we see quite different picture there be some place where those intervention base on the statistic appear to have be effective because there be few if any super output area list that remain affect by those issue of poverty and ill health today and there be other area that have struggle to move on we all know and understand why that be in some place if the economy of an area have long be base on mining and natural resource and there be no other direct employment opportunity there something different need to be find and many member have refer to the impact of that have touch on structure as one element will the hon member give way will with your indulgence madam deputy speaker an observation have make as have listen to the hon gentleman be that not one single member of his party stand up for the thousand of pensioner who be not give the justice they deserve in the mineworker pension scheme or the bcsss his party claim to stand up for pensioner and yet it do nothing and say nothing for those mining pensioner who deserve well deal if the hon lady refer to hansard for debate on these matter in previous parliaments she will find those point be raise by member from across the house rightly so with view to move the debate on to the decision that have be make today the clapham review of the effectiveness of the coalfields regeneration trust be key opportunity to consider the role that local government in particular play in the regeneration of our coalfield clearly that challenge exist at number of level the hon member for brecon radnor and cwm tawe david chadwick reference the large number of spoil heap some of which can see from the garden of my parent house number of local authority and government through local authority have seek to address that through planting and remediation to stabilise their spoil tip for example but there be still job to do as the year go by and the industry that produce those spoil tip become historical we know that we must effectively address the risk that they continue to pose to conclude my remark turn to the importance of learn from the work that the coalfields regeneration trust undertake and from the point that many member of all party have make in debate about these issue over many year we know that we be about to embark on process the uk have make progress in the decarbonisation of our economy since the early when as lead nation we begin the major shift away from coal in the coal produce most of our energy today it contribute to none our last coal fire power station recently close the trades union congress recently pass motion highlight that job be at risk in the oil and gas industry we talk about the just transition labour members be in my view justify in raise the problem that process have create but we must lay the groundwork for it remember intervention during the miner strike such as the distribution at my school of the eec butter mountain that be not an example of an effective economic intervention to address the need of people in difficulty if we be to have just transition away from fossil fuel in the future we must learn from the past mistake of all government in respect of coalfield and incorporate the lesson into effective policy for well future for all affected community call the minister thank all member for really thoughtful debate when member speak about their constituency in the way they have today we get sense of the pride of place congratulate my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee on secure the debate and thank the backbench business committee for agree to it the level of interest in the debate and the fact that two time limit on speech have be introduce speak volume know from my own experience of grow up in and represent constituency with fierce and proud industrial past build on the back of the coal that fire it just how much pride and sense of belong come with that they be job of course they be but they be more than that they be about people and place that identity have stay with the generation that have come since between and the closure of colliery result in approximately job loss that be not just about employment those closure mean the loss of the vital social facility that the national coal board and the trade union have provide for those community that be why the government be take concrete action to support coalfield community and secure the future prosperity of former mining community while honour their remarkable heritage we really get sense of that in the debate my hon friend the members for blyth and ashington ian lavery for ossett and denby dale jade botterill and for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman speak about community and solidarity as well as about heritage it be that sense of belong that we need to respect quite often hear this strongly when go around the country people feel not just that parliament be million mile away but that the next town be million mile away the isolation that people often feel economically socially and politically be profound and we must do far more to meet that challenge this government define mission be growth and we be determined that our coalfield community be central to it that be why we be work in partnership to invest in and empower the nation coalfield so that they can kick start growth in their area and increase living standard for work people we have already announce planning reform devolution our plan to make work pay and settlement to fix the foundation of local government that will also help coalfield to build their future and realise their full potential do the minister agree that economic growth be only meaningful if it take everyone in every community with it and people in every town feel the benefit include the town that we have talk about today my hon friend make very good point he be sit next to my hon friend the member for leigh and atherton jo platt they be both greater manchester mps and we be all very proud of greater manchester we all see the red dot on the skyline of manchattan as we call it very proudly and the booming city centre that be manchester however the truth be that unless the social opportunity be there and people have the confidence and skill to compete in that new market that be emerge it can feel million mile away that be really important and we do see that lot have be say about the mineworker pension scheme we recognise that for too long our coalfield community have be an afterthought which be why this government have reverse those historic injustice by transfer billion to mineworker pension our manifesto also promise that the truth of orgreave would come to light the bcsss be also mention and can say that the minister for trade be take that issue up with the urgency that member have call for in this house it be cover in lot of detail by my hon friend the members for bassetlaw jo white for easington grahame morris for amber valley linsey farnsworth for stafford leigh ingham and for nuneaton jodie gosling they all speak seriously and rightly about the urgency that be require to resolve this issue this government have hear that message loud and clear and know that ministers in other place be work on that will the minister give way very briefly please be grateful for the minister reassurance on the bcsss before he move off the issue of funding for growth number of hon member include my hon friend the members for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman and for ayr carrick and cumnock elaine stewart raise the issue of fair funding and the coalfields regeneration trust model for community wealth building it be seek relatively modest million in capital investment spread over five year which it believe could create half million square foot of new industrial space be the minister minded to look at that proposal favourably we be absolutely committed to ensure that every part of the country realise its full potential let we be clear everybody in every part of the country have potential but far too often that potential be not meet by opportunity we will look at any project and measure that aim to do what my hon friend have describe in the coalfield to ensure that potential be meet and can certainly take up that point and maybe follow up in writing the proud history of our coalfield community must be match with proud future late last year we publish the english devolution white paper and bill will follow that white paper include reform vision for the long term plan for town which the autumn budget confirm will be retain and reform as part of our regeneration programme we be proud that through that plan coalfield community from newark on trent to wrexham will receive package of up to million in funding and support furthermore this government be work with mayor where they be to produce local growth plan across their city region which sit alongside local coalfield community because we recognise that those be vital to our collective economic future that regeneration and the long term investment and co ordination that be need be reference by my hon friend the members for whitehaven and workington josh macalister for cannock chase josh newbury for north durham luke akehurst for leigh and atherton for ayr carrick and cumnock elaine stewart for chesterfield mr perkins for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor for north west leicestershire amanda hack and for airdrie and shotts kenneth stevenson they recognise that of course we can be proud of the history of our place we all be but the future be important too and if we do not put the building block in place to rebuild industry and pride we will miss trick as be reference early no working class person be wait for handout but we absolutely deserve hand up we be sick and tired of be tell to wait our turn to behave and stand in line and to know our place hop that somehow tomorrow our turn may just come lesson after lesson and generation after generation show that for all those promise it never come we can not have power wealth and opportunity constantly be hoard by the centre to the exclusion of our community that be impact by it that be why devolution be so important if we do not break away from the centralise model of command and control and the hoarding of power and opportunity we will never make progress with our economy society or political power in this country this week we be proud to be expand the devolution priority programme through which more mayor will be create with the power and the tool that they will need as local leader to do what be right for their area they will not have to come cap in hand to central government in constant wasteful bidding war like my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire louise jones pay tribute to the late john prescott working class voice in politic he take up that charge that fight and we all recognise the work that he do member of the house have our assurance that we stand with our coalfield community and the excellent members of parliament who have speak today question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider government support for coalfield community financial education beg to move that this house have consider financial education refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests be the chair of the all party parliamentary group on financial education for young people many member of that august body be on the benches today and it be worth point out that it be the second large all party parliamentary group in parliament beat only by that on the communal love for beer there be reason why the appg on financial education be so popular financial education be profoundly important topic that affect the life and life chance of our community right across the country we can not sugar coat this we be in mess when it come to financial education and financial literacy in our economy and our society and we have know that for age this be go back few year accept but one of the reason why be first draw to this topic be that do not receive any lesson on personal finance at all during the whole of my education in fact it be true to say that have be teach considerably more about the formation of oxbow lake than about personal finance debt management budgeting save compound interest pension and individual saving account those be thing that grown up worry about and that have such an impact on their life yet they be simply miss from my education be afraid it do not stop there because have ask my child age and about their financial education and they have receive none at all so there have be no improvement yet we know that this matter profoundly we know that those unfortunate enough to grow up in financially chaotic household have no education from their parent do not understand debt except for see the consequence of it and do not understand budgeting prudent financial management then become middle class secret if we care about the poor and the most disadvantaged in our society financial education must be core part of the curriculum in our school we know that financial stress have huge impact both on our economy and on our society way back in barclays bank do research that show that million hour be lose to the economy because of financial stress we also know that financial stress or financial worry be one of the core component of family breakdown and the break up of relationship lead to argument in the home and distress cause to child yet we know what the solution be we have have load of research the money and pensions service have say that attitude towards money and finance be fundamentally establish by the age of just seven we know that financial education in school be directly correlate with high career earning reduce personal debt increase pension saving and increase saving more generally we have all be elect to this place and we have all come here assume to improve the life and life chance of our constituent the single big thing we can do for our constituent in our time in this place be get effective financial education into the core curriculum say that to the minister because she need to reflect on what her ambition be for her time in this place we have have crack at it back in we or our predecessor think we have do jolly good job because financial education be include in the national curriculum in secondary school in england and in primary school in the devolved nation last year on the anniversary of that change the all party parliamentary group on financial education for young people undertake research to see what the impact of that inclusion in the national curriculum have be the awful truth be that it be virtually negligible because financial education be not in fact be teach we make the mistake as policymaker of say we ve change the policy job do that the solution but we do not take the next step and ensure that the policy be implement effectively indeed of teacher responsible for implement the national curriculum be either unaware of the requirement or unsure of whether there be requirement to teach financial education and of child have no recollection of have receive any why do we think we have solve the problem with policy when in practice the change do not take place part of the answer be that financial education be include within personal social health and economic education and it be not measure by ofsted and we all know that we get what we measure another part of the answer be that teacher lack confidence because they too have not receive financial education and they be unsure about their personal finance far too often financial education depend on there be personal convert among the teaching staff some school do brilliant job on this issue but too often that be wholly dependent on there be one member of staff who take the bit between the tooth just today young enterprise which operate the secretariat of the all party group publish report call make the classroom count it have do research and have assess the state of provision and how we can improve it its first conclusion concern the curriculum in both primary and secondary education this subject be too important to be leave to the periphery of the educational process it must be recognise as core element if financial education be core part of the curriculum it must be measure as such by ofsted the second issue be accountability we must inspect for financial education because we get what we measure the third issue be guidance there must be access to trust teaching material for hesitant teacher too often the all party group hear that teacher be not sure which resource from the plethora out there they should trust and they be naturally hesitant about brand material come into school we need the government to take step forward and build on the work already be do on trust resource the fourth point be about awareness the government must be clear and express the fact that financial education be core part of the curriculum finally put it last because it be the least important come money and resource they be necessary we need money to achieve thing but if the government take step one to four we would be of the way there there be solution to the money side of thing understand that the chancellor be never keen to write cheque but we have the dormant asset scheme and financial inclusion be core element of the distribution of dormant asset we also have the national lottery heritage fund which have offer to match fund the element spend on financial inclusion surely there be way that the government can make good use of that money the government be review the national curriculum so now be the time for they to take bold step and not just have the policy but ensure that it be act on will the minister include financial education in the primary curriculum will she undertake to measure what she want to see in our school and require ofsted to report on financial education in primary and secondary school will she embed financial education in the curriculum and not just in pshe will she show some ambition in the light of the oecd programme for international student assessment on financial literacy will she commit to the government apply to join that scheme will the minister develop the good work of the oak national academy which have produce about online lesson to support financial education and literacy will she follow that up with commitment to develop trust paper resource for the educational sector finally will she consider make proper use of the dormant asset fund and the national lottery heritage fund and direct additional funding from those source to financial literacy education in our primary and secondary school start by talk about ambition and want to finish on that too it be profoundly important for the life chance of our constituent over the next and year that we grasp this issue now we spend so much time on tittle tattle in this chamber make cheap debating point that may make the headline in the evening or tomorrow do not care whether this debate be report as long as we can get this simple change to our educational process and deliver for our constituent now be the time to do it rise order will start with an informal five minute time limit member can help each other thank the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew the chair of the all party parliamentary group on financial education for young people for secure this debate should first declare not only my interest be vice chair of the appg and have be trustee of girlguide bristol and south gloucestershire and of brilliant local youth work charity the foundation for active community engagement but my deep and long stand interest in this subject improve financial education for child and adult our focus be on the former this afternoon be the policy area among thousand of possible one that choose to focus on in my public policy master degree unfortunately that be not because think financial education be go well and that there could be lesson to apply to other policy area but because of how lacking financial education have be include in my personal experience there be real lack of financial education at school in my otherwise excellent state education important information on different type of mortgage and the key difference between secured and unsecured loan should not feel new at the point of major financial commitment and crucially at the point of risk in january the tuc report that total unsecured household debt that do not include mortgage and typically have high interest rate rise to billion the high ever level in the uk and that be before the pandemic despite financial education have be add to the secondary curriculum in england through pshe in the money and pensions service find in that only of young people recall receive financial education at school it be important to be clear that this quest for well financial education be not about place high value on any particular financial choice above other but everyone should feel capable and confident to make whatever financial decision be right for they and their circumstance that be too often not the case believe that person background should not determine their life chance and life choice and the lottery of financial education quality be huge barrier to make that reality the next generation should always do well than the last if we act to improve financial education it will help we to make good on that great british promise for all young people for those across the filton and bradley stoke constituency and beyond mention financial education in my maiden speech and be grateful in recent month to have the chance to raise it in the house with our secretary of state for education ask whether the independent and welcome curriculum and assessment review would consider foundational life skill such as financial education at all key stage along with the resource need to teach they with confidence as part of its work while none of we in the house can pre empt the conclusion of that important review be glad to hear the secretary of state confidence that the review would carefully consider what young people need in this area and any support that teacher may need for any reform curriculum report teacher confidence be understandably low as we have already hear this afternoon in teach subject that many of they be not teach either again understandably research show that teacher struggle to prioritise subject that be not assess and be within pshe indeed the money charity survey and in depth interview with teacher around the country in find that the prioritisation of assess subject be the most commonly identify barrier to deliver financial education with of teacher cite it so even when financial education be on the curriculum at secondary level it do not appear to be there firmly enough teacher give so much and have so much to contend with and do not believe that anyone in the house would wish to far overburden they or indeed the curriculum by add more stand alone subject in my view it be important to consider how financial education can be weave through exist relevant subject such as math to ensure that all young people receive the most relevant education to support they to thrive throughout life as the daughter of retire headteacher know well than to delve any far into the day to day from these benches but the evidence suggest that the current approach be not work for anyone yet there be wide issue too the university of cambridge find that financial habit typically form from around age seven that strongly suggest that early support be crucial if we be to break down this barrier to opportunity it be also worth note that financial education be on the curriculum at both primary and secondary level in scotland wales and northern ireland it be in england in particular where we be lag behind though implementation remain challenge more widely while formal education be of course important there be also vital role for other organisation from financial institution to community organisation number be already play their part from gohenry help young people to save while take part in money mission to build their long term financial knowledge and wellbee to hsbc and girlguiding work together to help girl and young woman build the two thing touch on early capability and confidence be thrill to speak at the launch of its new money confident badge even if have no long my own sash to sew it on to will not be able to mention they all but many more organisation be work in this space not least young enterprise which provide diligent and creative secretariat for the all party parliamentary group be also glad to hear recently from aviva in stoke gifford in my constituency about its work with young people madam deputy speaker hope you will not mind if share my thank to all the teacher and wide organisation use their time resource and creativity on financial education as part of our collective pursuit of support all young people to thrive look forward to hear other contribution to the debate and continue to work for change in this important area and for fair future for all thank my hon friend the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for bring this immensely important debate before the house be sure that hon member will have see the barclays bank television advert explain how money habit and behaviour be form in young people by the age of seven but government of all colour have continuously fail in promote the teaching of sound financial management to young people the education system be suppose to teach young people the game of life yet currently we be not even teach they the rule of the game before they play previous governments try with the coalition government introduce it into the national curriculum in but little progress have be make since then it be an indictment that one in two brits be find to be unable to pass financial literacy test run by the oecd the uk be well below comparable western nation such as france norway and canada indeed we rank alongside thailand and albania how on earth can it be the case that as one of the wealthy country in the world that be where we sit why be this of particular concern now technology have open up new world of consumerism be able to sit in the comfort of my own home and purchase pretty much any item would like it be the epitome of have the freedom to make one own financial decision however that freedom come with an understanding of how choice will impact my own personal financial wellbeing at the click of mouse or even touch of screen young people can make high value purchase without know how it may impact they because they be not teach the importance of budgeting and save young people be become addict to buy now pay later scheme which allow they to enter into credit agreement without fully assess whether they will be able to afford they in few month time there be also the additional threat of fraudster target young people in the hope that they will not know how to deal with complex financial problem be it any wonder that of young people worry about money daily we must do something about this the ongoing national curriculum review should not remove any aspect of the financial education that already exist since it remain an important part of school life for student be not the only one say that as of parent believe that school should be at the heart of develop well understanding of financial education for young people alongside keep it on the national curriculum well support for teacher and long last improvement be need hear of teacher have real concern about their own ability to teach student about sound money strongly urge the department and its partner to instigate well advice for teacher on how to improve the quality of these lesson finally as strong supporter of apprenticeship and vocational training would like the government to promote financial teaching in educational setting put simply one in three student leave school at for apprenticeship or employment at time of increase spending they potentially lose all chance of be teach financial education be it any wonder that nearly half of all apprentice struggle to keep up with their bill it would be negligence of the high order not to protect and strengthen the financial education provision for our young people we must not stand idle and allow the next generation to walk into financial ruin through not understand the thing that whether we like it or not make the world go round thank the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for bring forward this important debate on something that we do not discuss enough be not hugely knowledgeable on it until my partner become financial adviser we have lot of financial discussion now more often than not she be tell that spend too much money on warhammer say it be an investment it be definitely not those discussion open my eye massively and some shocking thing come up for example only of self employ people pay into pension that be tick time bomb and we must address it really think that come through education as the hon member for mid leicestershire mr bedford say our habit towards money be form at an early age the evidence for that be overwhelming and as government we need to start get on top of it see my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince squint little when member be talk about change what and how teacher should teach he have terrible poker face but we need to look at how to introduce this across the board so that it do not put more pressure on teacher because they be under enough under enough pressure as it be some good thing be go on in the private sector we have great company such as nationwide whose headquarters be in swindon something be incredibly proud of we also have santander which be not in swindon but it be still do great work so will give it praise the government need to work with some private company to see what they be do and what service they can offer alongside our school so that we can let our teacher teach and not overburden they be really proud to be part of this debate if we want to look after people and ensure that they do not suffer with mental health issue due to financial stress we have to get grip of this look forward to hear what the minister and other member have to say thank the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for secure this important debate find the statistic about what child remember of financial literacy education really sad it be not that teacher do not want to provide the education but as other have raise there be stretch time in the current education system and perhaps lack of confidence among teacher have year old son and have ask he number of time whether he have have the opportunity to learn about budgeting at school perhaps this just speak to the memory of year old child but he like many of his friend do not remember have have that important opportunity to learn how to budget most likely he do not sit down with he at the weekend to go through it and realise how much we as adult take for grant the thing that we have learn over the course of life we should not be rely on the passage of time and the experience of life we need to educate our young people about financial literacy from really early age as liberal democrat and as mum think it be really important that we use the curriculum review to modernise it and look at curriculum for life this be the perfect opportunity to include financial literacy my personal view which might raise eyebrow across the house be that put it into the math curriculum might help young people to see math as something that be relevant to their real life be sure that we have all have conversation with teenager who ask how be math relevant to my life they say that it be not well it very much will be when they get into adulthood and have to deal with mortgage household budgeting and the rest the reality of household budgeting come to the forefront of my mind when meet with christians against poverty in my constituency which do fantastic work with people who have get into debt often through no fault of their own through the cost of live crisis and personal circumstance however at the root of it be often lack of financial literacy we clearly need to provide more opportunity for young people as well as for adult because we have already say that young people tend to get their financial education from their parent ask the minister to ensure that there be deep commitment in the curriculum review to put financial education into the curriculum in way that will help child to remember it and take it forward in their life also ask she to support adult to get the financial education that they need so that they can complete the circle of empower themselves to be well with their finance and empower the next generation thank the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for bring this crucial conversation to the chamber we be not bear with the ability to open an isa choose private pension or invest our saving we do not have natural intuition about how to save or manage debt or how the tax system work so why be we send young people from school with little or no formal financial education have work for leicestershire training and enterprise council year ago where we support young people and adult into education and have hold number of role in the social housing sector support tenant welfare it be clear to that there be gap in people financial knowledge be really proud of some of the work that do before come to this place particularly lead team to set up the financial and digital inclusion project moneywise for leicester leicestershire and rutland target individual include in my constituency of north west leicestershire who be digitally and financially exclude from run that project the lack of basic skill around financial education and how much it be hold people back become clear to through the project we be able to empower people to have much more positive relationship with their finance as member of the work and pensions committee it have already become apparent to that lack of conversation and knowledge and probably confidence about long term financial planning be have detrimental impact on our relationship with our finance by provide financial education to young people we have an opportunity to reset our relationship with money and skill study by compare the market and the financial education charity mybnk find that almost two third of adult survey say that they do not recall receive financial education at school the same study find that only two in five respondent consider themselves financially literate there be hope though my son be currently study core math at as level and we have have many conversation about financial management from insurance to rent and mortgage to saving just because of that course this be an issue that can unite we across party line our young people deserve that at the very least they deserve basic understanding of how to manage their future finance it be not just current and future generation that could benefit the investing and saving alliance project that be the government to prioritise financial education we could inject an extra billion into the economy each year that would make real measurable and tangible difference to so many young people look forward to the minister response thank the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for secure the debate and for his valuable work on the all party parliamentary group on financial education for young people one of my first job be work in advice service time and time again people come to we for help after they have stack up debt many people have the same story it start out with not have household budget and have to borrow on credit card or through payday loan on astronomical rate of interest and eventually they become catch in spiral of debt and bad decision making would like to thank the wonderful staff and volunteer at the citizens advice service in my constituency who do fantastic work try to help people to get back on their foot after problem with debt work by brancab bedworth rugby and nuneaton citizens advice and north warwickshire citizens advice demonstrate that debt have change for people in my constituency instead of loan and credit card the component of debt have move worryingly to basic housing and utility cost before covid financial capability be at the heart of what brancab do and it win national award for its work until lack of funding put an end to it my area have the fifth high rate of insolvency per adult in the country and to year old account for of all insolvency this be why financial education be so crucial become insolvent before the age of will have untold effect on their financial stability for year to come and we need to stop more young people fall into that hole support the recommendation of the education committee to review the content of the math curriculum to expand the provision and relevance of financial education that sentiment be share by teacher at polesworth school in my constituency support the work do by people such as rob boland who run cotswold independent financial services and work with the personal finance society which carry out important educational work around budgeting and tax and stay safe from scam it be staggering that have people come to my surgery who have well pay job but have no idea when they go to university about the impact of the debt they be sign up to with their student loan or even what the interest rate mean we must also recognise that our young people face new challenge social medium have fuel get rich quick mindset with influencer encourage young people to try to make money quickly through risky scheme that be exacerbate by the cost of living crisis perhaps if liz truss have spend bit more time in financial education class when she be at her grammar school in leeds she would not have plunge the country into economic disaster too often we forget that our young people be hit hard by the crisis and be still suffer from financial insecurity meet sixth form student at nicholas chamberlaine school in bedworth recently they talk to about how much more difficult it be to find work at the weekend or in the evening and how they have never receive any kind of education or help around personal finance be pleased that the government have commission an expert lead curriculum and assessment review to ensure that young people leave school ready for work and ready for life that know be welcome by local business in my constituency it be time that we demystify everyday finance so that everyone can be equip with the skill they need for everyday life and do not have to turn to an advice service for help too thank the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for bring forward the debate and for the work he do on the all party parliamentary group for financial education for young people would love to see world where everybody be financially literate where people understand their finance manage they properly invest save manage debt and protect themselves appropriately in other word where people be financially savvy it be good for people and it be good for our economy financial education develop tool for life and create good habit it can help people deal with cost of living challenge and help break down barrier to opportunity too because make the most of resource when there be few of they be paramount many people lack the basic skill of financial acuman and that disadvantage they through life however if someone have strong grasp of financial concept they be less likely to get into debt can make well decision and prosper that be why financial education be must for adult and child alike have number of idea about how we can help educate adult too in that area accord to the government sponsor money and pensions service of adult more than million people do not feel confident manage their own money some million people have less than in saving and million of we be in serious debt legal and general report deadline to breadline suggest that the average uk consumer be just day from the breadline if they lose their income in my previous life in the banking sector know only too well how lack of financial management blight life sadly see several people throughout my career who do not plan and manage their finance appropriately or plan and protect their future appropriately when life take an unexpected turn and circumstance change witness some incredibly sad situation where people lose everything that story tell we of an urgent need for financial education programme for adult and not just for child of course the key to have financially literate adult be to teach financial education in our school although as we have hear it be add to the national curriculum in its delivery be patchy at good and it need to be improve few year ago be invite to deliver financial education session to group of sixth form student follow the session few teacher come over thank for what have teach they and then ask for some advice and they be the teacher responsible for deliver that financial education to the pupil we have hear that financial education be include in the curriculum for secondary school but too advocate for its inclusion in primary education that could be do simply by embrace it in the math syllabus as member of the all party parliamentary group on financial education for young people support the recommendation that financial education be mandatory part of the english primary curriculum training have to be give to teacher and the subject should be promote by the government in both primary and secondary education want to finish with story of person whom admire for their brilliant financial management single parent who juggle finance to bring up two boy she literally have different pot for different fund from summer holiday to christmas to birthday to her contingency fund for rainy day each week she would use she perfectly craft budget book to separate out her fund so much for food so much for bill and the remainder spread across her pot she never rely on credit card or borrowing her son never want for anything see themselves as equal to their friend and would only really appreciate how stretch the family finance be when they get old she have that skill embed in she from young age by her parent that person be my mum be financially educate early can have profound effect on future generation we need that change it be an essential life skill and implore the minister to consider that as part of the curriculum review thank the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for his obvious passion for the subject in october national trading standards release research show that of uk adult have be target by scam and just over third of those lose money as result the government be crack down on online crime and fraud but clearly one other long term solution be to make sure that everybody be financially educate and financially literate if we educate our child and young people to be more confident with how and why they manage their money over time they will be less susceptible to those fraud and scam which sadly can only grow with the development of artificial intelligence as we have already hear many young people form their money habit at very young age as young as seven or eight remember my parent teach the importance of save give little saving book and make sure that every week put away some of the that earn from my job deliver newspaper unfortunately as we have also hear parent who have not manage to acquire financial literacy sometimes pass on bad habit to their child and up to third of british worker live from pay cheque to pay cheque fear that we be not do enough to help parent and young people to break that cycle be shocked to hear people work in food bank say that many user of their service would benefit hugely from financial education and literacy and even some simple advice on how to draw up budget and understand how to make sure they will have enough money when the bill be be send out even simple thing can make huge difference so that people do not have to end up rely on food bank with the future as yet unknown pupil enter secondary school this september will finish their gcse in june and their level in if they decide to go on to university they might graduate in think it safe to say that while we do not know for sure what opportunity will be available to they thing may well look very different from the way they look now good financial education and literacy will stand they in good stead financial literacy education have previously be add to the national curriculum but more must be do to ensure that child be teach the subject financial education must have breadth teach student not only how to budget and all the good stuff like simple versus compound interest but enable they to understand the importance of save for pension and to recognise an investment scheme that be protect by the financial conduct authority for instance so that they can avoid some of the more sparkling deal online the good news be that those who have receive financial education and remember it be more likely to save feel confident about money and use bank account that show that when effort be put in it do indeed reap reward the need for financial education be clear to everyone in the house and beyond it be not luxury but necessity well remember be teach in depth about trigonometry and have to say that wish have be teach about pension instead thank the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for secure the debate typical weekend for start at the shop but not high street one although there be plenty of those in york instead it be my toddler plastic shop full of fruit veg and of course yorkshire tea when try to pay with cash be tell no daddy use card it be world away from grow up even in the we face great paradox in this country we have world lead financial service sector but accord to recent uk finance report the uk rank out of country for financial literacy among adult it be imperative that we do well here at home for too long we have struggle to bolster financial education in school my wife be dedicated teacher whose current battle be teach child about the value and shape of coin on more serious note however worry about the impact that social medium have on child when it come to financial advice call this the tiktokification of financial education we often see influencer give out unregulated advice drive the sale of harmful product plug as get quick rich scheme as former regulator at the financial conduct authority can say with some degree of certainty that regulator be not up to speed on this let now say something about the insurance sector at the fca we see that consumer have poor understanding of matter such as shrinkflation when their policy do not keep up to date with their need too rarely do they understand concept such as auto renewal far too many household we find in britain be either under cover or over covered my hon friend speech have make laugh as his speech usually do through my family and the community in which grow up have see that many people who fall victim to scam be once extremely savvy about financial management the people who fall into these trap once run their own business or have quite mature understanding of these thing financial education have its limit so we still need very strong protection when many people have more than one insurance policy for the same thing be we not fail they they do not need education they just need people they can go to who can protect they and give they advice on issue they may never fully understand will come on to scam but on the question of advice welcome the fca advice guidance boundary review financial advice be often too difficult for consumer to access we also need great financial education on insurance recently use google analytics to research search trend since there have be rapid increase in the number of people search opt out of my pension how can we expect people to save into their pension when the benefit be so poorly communicate the public be ask to fuel their car for long journey but when it come to retirement they do not know how far the road go we must make that cultural shift with the forthcoming pension review we must reinvent and reinvigorate our retirement saving there be no more important time to educate people about pension than at school member will know that be passionate about tackle fraud indeed my old job be break fraud attempt in the private sector even now as an mp hear heartbreake story of constituent who have fall victim to scam the british population be target by organise criminal from across the globe which be drive by the popularity of the english language and the affluence of the uk know from recent visit to city of london police that fraud and cyber crime account for of all crime let that sink in for too long the uk have be target praise the minister for security my hon friend the member for barnsley north dan jarvis and lord hanson for their important work great public awareness of how to spot scam and socialise some of these concept be important praise martin lewis for raise awareness of celebrity impersonation scam and praise his money and mental health policy institute for do much to remove the stigma of be scamme great education ultimately mean great fraud awareness financial education be not the sole responsibility of this house this government or even teacher it be down to firm and be hearten by my engagement with the sector stepchange have also do important work on debt advice give special shout out to the financial inclusion commission which recently join when it come to financial education we must ensure that the financial sector play its part close by return to my son plastic greengrocery be do my bit for the next generation but be just one household we have to think of new way to engage the generation of tomorrow on thing like pension scam and insurance this require financial education in school and hope to play my part in that debate thank the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew and my hon friend the member for filton and bradley stoke claire hazelgrove for secure this debate can tell my hon friend the member for york outer mr charters that coin be heptagonal support the need for further financial education in school but as member may have sense from my poker face early have few caveat please take they as constructive rather than destructive have work for homelessness charity know that people can not budget their way out of poverty but this conversation be not just about budgeting it be about the wide view and idea on financial education member on both side of the house have recognise the power of teach young people about some of these pitfall and scam such as the impact of turn to payday loan shark when time be tough it be not about tell young people how they have to live their life or what they have to do but about provide awareness of the danger that they face as many hon member will know because mention it in almost every speech give use to be teacher be secondary school math teacher for year teach young people from year to year include teach level math and further math so teach math up to degree level absolutely love trigonometry wait until you get to further math trigonometry and sine and cosine rule madam deputy speaker can tell you it be brilliant also specialise in statistic strangely enough despite my engineering degree there be misapprehension that the ability to teach math equate excuse the pun to an ability to teach finance if we be have the ordinary to and fro that we normally see in the chamber would defend myself by point out that can read book but can not teach english literature finance and math both include number but history and english both include word and they be different subject when chat to my conservative friend he be the reason be in this place we have very animate discussion about education once say to he what do you think be the most important skill for teacher he say well discipline and the ability to get mark do on time he come up with whole list of thing but say to he the one thing you have not mention be the ability to explain thing clearly surely that be the most important skill for teacher could teach the hon member for broadland and fakenham how to do compound interest which come up on the math curriculum but if be ask to teach he how pension work would struggle that mean not that do not know how pension work but that have not be teach the skill to teach that to somebody else people do not naturally have the ability to explain thing they have to be train in that skill hope what be say in roundabout way be see as constructive not critical if we believe in financial it be just like be back at school put the phone in the box minister you do have to if we believe that teach financial education be important in school then it have to be teach properly the hon member for broadland and fakenham correctly say that measure be bring through this place over year ago but the subject be not truly be teach in school in the way that we would like it to be would like it to be distinct bespoke subject at worst it could be module teach as part of subject like business study or economic my wife be an economics teacher so she will love for that suggestion rather than add to the already extensive math curriculum do not think it would be feasible to add financial education to the math curriculum or that that would have the outcome that the house want to see the hon member for broadland and fakenham talk about the importance of financial education be measurable and could not agree more one of my big frustration as math teacher have get time madam deputy speaker will not go on big story be when student would say to be this go to be in the exam that be frustrating because genuinely love math want to teach people that not because it be go to come up in the exam but because it be truly interesting it be the way he say it can see the hon gentleman be model student we have to recognise the way the school system currently work if young people think there will not be an exam on subject they do not think that subject be measurable equally if teacher do not see that something be go to be measurable in an ofsted inspection it will be move down the list of priority we have to recognise that lot of teacher have lot on their plate if we want financial education to be on the top of the plate the cherry on the top perhaps we need to ensure that it be measurable accountable and take seriously do not believe that bolt financial education on to the math curriculum will make that happen would much prefer it to be bespoke subject have ramble on enough but hopefully have make my point call the liberal democrat spokesperson be not quite sure how be suppose to follow the hon member for harlow chris vince he be extremely entertaining and informative wish to thank the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for secure this debate he speak with passion and empathy for those who be struggle with financial literacy and make sure that this house know how important that topic be all member in this house have probably at some point come across somebody perhaps constituent on doorstep family member or friend who say that people just do not get teach what they need to know in life at school that be overdone slightly the fundamental of math science and literacy do serve we well in life but there be truth in that statement some of the hard practical daily challenge of adulthood be often not address properly at least not in an applied way during our education nowhere be this more apparent than in financial literacy which be of course distinct from numeracy it be not just about add and subtract or even work out percentage but budgeting debt management save for the future and investing these be thing that can empower people to make well decision for their life and set they up to achieve their goal but we let people down when we view these skill as specialist rather than essential let focus on two element in particular investing and debt the british seem to have big problem with investing there be an assumption that it be for trader or the rich and our national conversation tend to shy away from it pension be about the only arena in which it be discuss properly but even then it be kind of push to the back of our mind it be all about auto enrolment and it be deal with out of sight by other wish to pick up on the point make by the hon member for swindon north will stone about how few of the self employ invest in their own pension that certainly happen to my parent who be self employ all their life be self employ too and for the large bulk of my career do not invest in pension if brits be equip with the knowledge and the skill to make relatively safe sensible investment over the course of their lifetime the benefit to those individual and to the economy as whole would be enormous research by moneybox reveal that two third of britons be bad off on average due to low financial confidence and knowledge astonishingly it suggest that if these people be well equip it would equate to potential trillion of extra spending power in the uk economy over their lifetime member might think that this difference merely correlate with the have and the have not but moneybox research find that in most instance the key indicator of success be financial confidence and not where people start in life this alone should motivate we to improve the delivery of financial education in school but also to ensure that all adult can well equip themselves today although this be beyond the scope of the debate today this be where the advice guidance boundary review could be crucial for britain growth prospect we must upskill all of britain today and not only the citizen of the future let turn now to debt the consequence of get this wrong be grave our failure to equip people with the knowledge that they need to manage and escape debt put the most vulnerable in our society at risk risk of hunger risk of ill health and risk of financial ruin my inbox be full of email from people who reach crisis point before seek help in each case there be so many straightforward step that they could have take to prevent escalation but combination of shame and financial illiteracy leave people strand helplessly watch on as their situation go from bad to bad wish to pick up on the point make by the hon member for harlow about people not be able to budget their way out of poverty he be absolutely right but we can stop people from spiral and make thing bad this point be deeply personal to have see my family suffer from the crippling nature of debt on more than one occasion both as child and as an adult sometimes think to myself that just wish that they have reach out to soon but have well wish than that wish that our education system and society more broadly talk about debt and how to deal with it far more openly when visit my local citizen advice bureau in wallington recently staff tell how predatory company be offer individual voluntary arrangement to people who be totally ill suited to they on the face of it the attraction be clear instead of struggle with debt on multiple front person can make one simple regular payment to company and that company will deal with everything for they the trouble be that these company do not always act in the individual interest they have an incentive to sell iva as they make money from they and they end up be sell to people who have well alternative such as debt management order this practice need to be regulate well but we should also empower citizen to know well the liberal democrats support modernised curriculum curriculum for life that ensure that child be equip with the skill require for adulthood with focus on well understanding of personal finance and financial responsibility clearly financial education need to start early and must become key part of the primary curriculum research show that money habit be set at the age of seven yet there be no statutory requirement to teach personal finance in primary school in england furthermore we must support teacher to deliver that education effectively that mean provide centralised guidance teacher training and signpost to quality resource the government should back the national campaign to raise awareness of financial education and its benefit and support initiative such as my money week which promote financial literacy in school and community but the job do not end in school and the urgent need to address financial illiteracy can not be overstate as the hon member for york outer mr charters outline today young people be increasingly turn to social medium for financial advice just last week the financial wellbeing charity your money find that six in young people follow so call financial influencer or finfluencer which be difficult to say with trust their advice alarmingly one in say that they would act on that advice without do further research if we do not fill the gap other will the liberal democrats will continue to push for measure that address financial exclusion that can be do by support banking hub with their crucial offer of face to face advice as well as by protect funding for citizen advice bureaux such as the one that visit in wallington the evidence be overwhelming financial education be not nice to have it be essential for the wellbeing of our citizen and the future of our economy urge the government to act decisively and ensure that every child in the uk have access to the financial education that they need and deserve call the shadow minister warmly congratulate my hon friend the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew on secure this important debate and commend he for his sustained effort to drive up the quality and availability of financial education offer to our young people there be sometimes tendency in this house perhaps an understandable one to gravitate towards short termism it be therefore sincere pleasure to follow my hon friend who along with his colleague in the all party parliamentary group on financial education for young people have be do such excellent work to promote reform that take long view and be gear towards boost the life chance of future generation good financial education deliver not only by school but by parent and family and within community have the potential to produce generation wise to the danger of credit card debt alert to the practice of predatory payday lender and confident in their ability to open bank account and budget appropriately believe that all of we in this place be truly committed to reduce inequality and ensure that everyone have the good possible start in life and can think of few well idea than ensure that all young people enter adulthood with sound grasp of how to manage their money the british public seem to share that assessment research survey of uk adult conduct by santander reveal that full feel that well financial education in their young year would have improve their ability to manage their finance through the ongoing cost of living crisis meanwhile two third of young people believe that lack of financial education have play role in they amass the debt that they hold indeed it be not just adult but child who be deeply concerned about financial matter the london institute of banking and finance report in that of child worry about money and their personal finance that figure be hardly surprising when we consider that today child be the most digitally expose in history they face constant barrage of offer to spend money in alluring but wasteful way many of the app download on to the phone that our child spend so much time on be full of shin icon invite they to spend real world money with the tap of finger in exchange for worthless in game currency young player of online game be prompt to spend in some case hundred of pound on loot box or so call cosmetic item that is virtual in game weapon or an outfit that be slightly different colour from the default option financial literacy be clearly skill that our child and young people need to protect they and prepare they for the future although there be undoubtedly still work to be do briefly draw the house attention to the solid foundation lay by successive conservative government over the past year after all the conservatives leave england as one of the top perform country in education under the conservative government child in england be name the good in the west for reading and be rank well at math in the western world in the timss trend in international mathematic and science study it be conservative government who create the national network of math hub to support school in improve their mathematic teaching that network be partnership between school college and other organisation that work together to provide support for math teach in their region the positive impact of those hub on young people ability to manage and understand money and finance be obvious we be clear that we intend to go far at the last election we set out comprehensive plan to ensure that every child study math to the age of so that they would leave school with good numeracy skill that would help they to navigate their finance with confidence that be not to suggest that the entire burden of provide robust financial education can or should fall upon our school as be so often the case family also have central role to play in ensure that child be imbue with good financial common sense that do not need to be overly complex simple measure such as offer child small amount of weekly pocket money can help to normalise good habit such as save and think carefully before make purchase accord to an ing survey of parent across europe give child pocket money reduce the risk of they get into debt as adult be great example of that whenever be my mum take down to northern bank as it be then give could have buy second hand car for that in those day and tell to put it in my bank account do the hon lady agree that if everybody have mother like mine they would be lot well off thank the hon member for that great contribution to the debate agree that all those small thing add up and make difference to our financial literacy be chartered accountant but that be not what make financially literate it be the lesson be teach by my family and the job that do when be young member have give great example of how they come to understand finance in an increasingly contactless world it be important that child and young people physically see and feel cash that be the way in which value be tangibly understand to return to school financial education be not as have be note statutory part of the national curriculum in primary school in england but in contrast in wales scotland and northern ireland it be very much embed at primary level give the way in which our child be relentlessly pressure to spend money that they may not even have and in the light of cambridge university research suggest that habit and attitude towards money be form by the age of seven there be much logic to the argument that financial education whether deliver by school parent or even community hub and other organisation should not wait for the later year and should be continuous teacher also feel that start good financial education early be important for the future wellbeing of young people accord to survey of primary teacher consider teach financial education to be very important we may hear more about that when the francis review of the national curriculum be complete urge the minister to answer the question that my hon friend the member for broadland and fakenham ask about the government plan for the curriculum in secondary school the picture be somewhat different in the then conservative government act to ensure that financial education be place on statutory footing in local authority school however the all party parliamentary group on financial education for young people which once again praise as an outstanding example of everything an appg should aspire to be note in its build beyond barriers report that over half of teacher do not know that financial education be part of the curriculum at all that be matter of some concern it be certainly important that the topic of financial education be address in the classroom in an appropriate way have no doubt that our hard work teacher be keen to play their part in deliver that content the same report find that three in four teacher believe that they should play lead role in impart financial skill to child the obstacle be report to be inadequate training limited funding and an understandable feeling that there be simply not sufficient time in the school year to deliver those lesson in government the conservatives seek to mitigate the funding issue with an investment of over million to embed and scale teacher training in financial education the money and pensions service do excellent work develop and testing approach to support teacher and practitioner work with child and young people in vulnerable circumstance to deliver financial education ultimately though we must acknowledge that the school timetable be already under intense pressure and there be many compete call on limited time that be why would argue that the good financial education that every child deserve be well deliver not only in school but in the family set in community and with the help of valuable resource conclude with simple message which hope underscore some of the excellent contribution that we have hear today financial education be invaluable and transform life outcome research undertake by compare the market tell we that today just two fifth of young adult rank as financially literate we can and must do well conservative members will keep these matter under careful review and hope that the minister will address the question that have be raise once again thank all those who have speak and in particular my hon friend the member for

pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker it be not often we get to share time together but you have whether you like it or not for at least half an hour or thereabout be so appreciative of this time in the house to highlight the need of the manufacturing and engineering industry in northern ireland northern ireland have fast become giant in aerospace we have skilled workforce low overhead and the perfect connectivity for business investment that be what we have and that be what we do we have not only the manufacture giant spirit aerosystems but wrightbus harland and wolff and thales the list go on they be all supply with specialist part by plethora of skilled small engineering firm that dot throughout the province in particular in strangford must make clear from the outset that when talk about the manufacturing industry today do not just mean the big firm be think of all the small firm that rely on this business the impact on the local economy be massive indeed invest ni have highlight that manufacturing account for some of employment and of gross value add make it key sector in the northern ireland economy underline that it be key sector and can not underline that enough it be vital for northern ireland northern ireland be home to five company with the supply chain quality system gold award out of total of nine across the united kingdom northern ireland be again as the secretary of state will know kick on and work above the standard that many have for the united kingdom with five out of nine we have more than any other uk region we offer reliable successful and competitive supply chain with expertise in key technology for automobile we be the world lead region for the supply of tyre pressure monitoring system and we have leading capability in the manufacture of complex aluminium casting as well as key strength in the production of composite vehicle body for lead sport car brand we do much in northern ireland we have world class solution in the design and manufacture of mobile bulk processing and wet process equipment when people buy from northern ireland they buy year of lead the world in mobile bulk material processing equipment and we manufacture more than of the world mobile crushing and screen equipment again want to say these thing because northern ireland often lead the way and it be always privilege to come and tell not only the world but this chamber about that the low carbon sector employ more than people in more than company with an annual turnover in excess of billion northern ireland company have the capability of provide range of innovative product and service to address the specific need of the various energy and water supply chain the wastewater sector in northern ireland have turnover of billion in gva of billion and employee northern ireland be one of the most diverse consumer good sector in the uk offer wide range of design and manufacturing base company more than people be employ in the sector our company have develop manufacturing capability and design or technology lead product and continue to remain competitive in global marketplace while that be the foundation of the big picture of manufacturing in northern ireland also highlight that we be yet to meet our potential which simply can not be meet without great investment know that for every penny spend the local economy reap the benefit in pound with that in mind have be in contact with and meet the gmb and unite union represent spirit who have indicate the support need in the sale of business transition spirit aerosystems facility in northern ireland produce part for variety of aircraft manufacturer with about of production on the wing and fuselage for airbus that work employ motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now kitchen know what be happen there just have not look up at the clock it be pleasure to continue the debate refer to the airbus fuselage and how that work employ of the strong labour force labour intensive contract equate to some of production work for bombardier and small aircraft manufacturer such as hondajet and rolls royce and the remain about of work be in engineer it human resource quality assurance and so on it be really important that we focus if we can on where we be boeing interest in purchase spirit be primarily about consolidate its own supply chain to ensure quality control it have no interest in retain production for its primary competitor airbus currently airbus intention be to take control of spirit operation in its own supply chain it have no interest in production for other aircraft producer further challenge be pose by the fact that operation across spirit site be integrate worker be employ across different project for different client so even if division of activity under separate ownership be possible it be unclear whether those operation could be sustain that be one of our concern look to the minister and to the secretary of state for northern ireland for some help on that believe the opinion of the union be that the facility must remain under one owner as that be the only option that would guarantee and safeguard production airbus already operate model that would make the retention of highly skilled job in northern ireland possible through for instance integration into the airbus atlantic group that would include production site across five different country that give flexibility and strength across continent airbus already operate contract with variety of partner include again bombardier dassault aviation and atr the northern ireland facility be critical to airbus and its future growth belfast be vital supplier to the and it can not risk any disruption to production by take control of the entire site single owner could avoid the outsourcing problem that have plague boeing and disruption could also bring liability for hefty financial penalty have to underline that the worker in belfast who have give many year of service their blood sweat and tear be the innovator and builder of the airbus project the unique expertise in belfast can not be easily replicate elsewhere it be unique to we in belfast and it be important that it be retain as such accord to report spirit belfast will be profitable if production increase to the plan for aircraft month in the non airbus work at spirit belfast could be view as bonus for airbus not burden spirit belfast have also recently sign two promising new contract with successful aerospace company that be likely to improve the plant profitability bombardier which represent some and grow of the work do at spirit belfast have also be customer for year there be clear continuity on the base and among the workforce all local political representative and all party across all of northern ireland spirit management and the department agree with our demand for one owner solution as the good outcome for all worker the aerospace sector and the wide northern ireland economy however to date disappointingly say this with respect always do because that be the person be the chief executive of all the respective company and the secretary of state for northern ireland have fail to engage with senior steward or the workforce if that have change will be more than happy but whenever meet they few week ago that have not happen they appear to be leave thousand of job and livelihood at risk or of be dictate to by the market this decision be not acceptable neither be it in the good interest of the worker impact it be imperative that the next course of action be to maintain and future proof the highly skilled job and the approximately job intertwine via the supply chain in the northern ireland economy that would continue vibrant and historic aerospace sector in northern ireland the workforce need the support of central government be quite sure that the minister and the secretary of state for northern ireland will reassure we why be this important spirit aerosystems be linchpin of the economy in the great belfast area statistical analysis from the northern ireland statistics and research agency structure of the northern ireland economy publish in september estimate that for every job sustain in the non automobile vehicle production sector in northern ireland almost two more job in the broad economy local service and the supply chain be sustain through indirect and induced employment for every one job there be two more out there so we get three for the price of one consider the high value add nature of spirit activity with very developed local supply chain both regionally and across britain and ireland that ratio be even high it be estimate that the job at the company site in northern ireland sustain further indirect and induced job in the wide service economy and supply chain base on the nisra type ii employment multipli for manufacturer of other transport equipment the data be clear and we need the help any threat to spirit operation in northern ireland translate to potential threat to more than job in the wide economy such threat would be devastating for the northern ireland economy as the wage bill for the spirit workforce alone amount to approximately million year contribute large percentage of the region total economic consumption it be not small fry it mean lot to the northern ireland economy as do the skill factor of those job the total expenditure of the company be estimate to be at least million year the loss of this productive activity would have huge impact on the northern ireland economy this be key vital and really important base on the nisra estimate from type ii economic multipli for the manufacture of other transport equipment reduction of million in demand would reduce northern ireland gross value add by billion that be more than of the region total annual economic output that illustrate the vital importance of this sector spirit production be also critical element of northern ireland heavy industrial base and key driver for export it be vital to the realisation of any regional manufacturing or industrial strategy that may be agree at the stormont executive these job represent some of the good employment opportunity for individual who come from the working class area of belfast and the wide community the secretary of state and the minister know that we all do the cross community employment at the site benefit all work class area with the job create have profound impact on the transition away from conflictual society know the secretary of state be commit to that want that for our society this be part of how we do that we give people job and opportunity across the community to help the community to heal and to move forward would certainly like to see that youth employment opportunity in the aerospace sector be always attractive to young worker from all community who be seek to improve their life just before
