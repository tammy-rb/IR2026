difficult to source affordable nutritious food the situation have be make bad by flood in scotland and by international pressure such as the war in ukraine energy price and brexit there be enterprise

recognise the point that the hon lady make about the pressure on the food supply chain the uk government be closely monitor the impact on the agricultural sector of the flooding cause by storm and we be work with the environment agency to resolve that the department for environment food and rural affairs can provide financial assistance to the farming sector to cover uninsurable loss incur as

member for keighley robbie moore the excellent new water minister at defra for more information now come to the shadow minister and welcome he to his position thank you mr speaker it be pleasure to be here although have to say that there be not particularly stiff competition for the role from scotland inflation might be slowly come down but food inflation in scotland still stand at more than force family to choose between be able to eat or heat their home or give the increase level of destitution neither thousand of people in scotland be turn to food bank not as one off last resort but as means of get by week after week it be clear that both our government should be work together much well to tackle this so what specific step will the minister take to work with the scottish government and the food industry to ensure that food price do not continue to rise at unaffordable rate do he really believe that the autumn statement will give family any confidence that the government understand how difficult it be for people in scotland right now welcome the hon member to his new position recognise the point he make about stiff competition but nonetheless very much welcome he this government be absolutely committed to tackle the rise price that household be face which be why the prime minister have an absolute focus on reduce the level of inflation but the hon member be right to say that both government should be work together to alleviate pressure on household budget this government have demonstrate that through the huge support that have be put in place to support household with energy price and through other measure to ensure that financial help be in place to support hard press household post office branch closures what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of post office branch closure on the delivery of government service in scotland what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of post office branch closure on the delivery of government service in scotland the united kingdom government continue to provide significant support to the national post office network add up to more than billion over the last year this funding enable of individual in rural area to live within three mile of their near post office in with the overall network as large today as it have be for five year our rural branch of the post office be at the very core the very heart of our rural community at present his majesty government provide certain service to the public via the post office network do the minister agree that it would be good notion to encourage the scottish government to go down the same route and provide as many service as possible in that way thus ensure the future of those branch agree with the hon member recognise the vital importance of post office for constituent in rural community such as his own and also in my own constituency in the scottish borders it be of course for the scottish government to assess how to make their service available to people across scotland consider accessibility as well as value for money for the taxpayer however would be happy to facilitate meeting with my colleague in the department for business and trade to see what further encouragement we could give the scottish government to use the post office network for the delivery of their service scotland have see the closure of post office in the past two year yet as the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone point out the community that still have post office be lose access to government service particularly in rural area driver and vehicle licensing agency service be due to cease be available at post office from the end of next march what conversation have the minister have with the department for business and trade about keep dvla service available from post office should start by correct the hon gentleman in that the post office network be not in decline more post office have be open than close over the past year we do see fluctuation in different part of the country with many postmaster run franchise business in their own right many face the same challenge as other high street business the dvla and the post office extend their contract until march the post office network operate commercially at arm length from the government and be responsible for take decision on commercial matter such as the dvla contract devolution in scotland what assessment he have make of the state of devolution in scotland what assessment he have make of the state of devolution in scotland with devolved power the scottish government can tailor policy in area such as health education and justice as well as in tax and welfare through additional power in the scotland act the uk government be work with local government and local partner to deliver on their need and wish that be real devolution in action climate change talk at begin tomorrow and one of the most important issue to be agree be the climate loss and damage fund the secretary of state will know that scotland have lead the way on that become the first country in the global north to pledge financial support to address loss and damage but he and his conservative colleague be intent on limit the scottish government international engagement can he tell why he want to silence scotland voice and prevent we from provide that global leadership it be very straightforward we understand that there will be environmental engagement overseas by the scottish government and that be devolved matter what we have try get grip on be the scottish government travel overseas meet ministers discuss reserved area such as constitutional affair and foreign affair and stray away from the portfolio of matter that be devolve to they that be our position it be obvious that in order to cement sense of economic resilience scotland require population growth strategy but the devolution settlement unfit as it be will not come anywhere near that and the government continue to set their face against it can the secretary of state explain why if the scottish government want more people to settle in scotland and immigration be at record high they need to build more housing have low taxis and well public service and make scotland more attractive to people do my right hon friend share my disappointment that the snp green scottish government continue to use the devolution settlement as platform to pursue constitutional grievance in reality would not achieve the good outcome for the people of scotland and our constituent mean the two government work together on project for example the if the government work together that will actually be deliver absolutely agree with my right hon friend the along with the come up as vital route in the union connectivity review by lord hendy of richmond hill sir peter hendy as he be at the time we be finally work with the scottish government and the uk government be fund feasibility study for the upgrade of the be delighted that progress be be make be it not the case that the scottish government have consistently stray outside the limit of the devolution settlement so it be very difficult to take the snp seriously as defender of devolution when it have so little respect for the current settlement my hon friend be right everyone forget that the scottish government get up every day and go to work to destroy devolution and the united kingdom the defender of devolution and the strengthener of the united kingdom be this government call the shadow secretary of state let take this opportunity to congratulate my hon friend the member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks not only on his vast and fast promotion to the shadow front bench but on the swing from the snp that bring he the by election victory the announcement of the closure of the refinery at grangemouth be hammer blow too many community be still live with the devastation of be leave behind after coalmine closure in the that must not be allow to happen again grangemouth owner be buy football club and invest in plant elsewhere while the worker lose out the prime minister have decide that culture war on the environment trump get the uk into the global green energy race by back labour green energy superpower plan the devolution settlement demand that both government work together but they certainly do not what discussion be the secretary of state have with the scottish government to protect job at grangemouth what impact will the closure have on the acorn carbon capture and storage project first of all it be very worrying time for those whose job be at risk at the grangemouth refinery this morning the under secretary of state for scotland my hon friend the member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont and minister from the department for energy security and net zero meet neil gray from the scottish government and yesterday my hon friend have meeting with the local authority work be go on it be ironic that the scottish government want to shut down oil and gas because when that happen people suddenly realise the need to manage transition and take we gradually to net zero while protect people livelihood on acorn and the scottish cluster have speak to the chief executive of storegga which be pull the project together he tell that the refinery closing have little impact on its project because grangemouth be supply the blue hydrogen to the refinery and other and the emission from that be be put into the north sea it be the anniversary of the scottish parliament next year one of the labour party proud achievement however recently it have be rive by failure and scandal from one in seven on nhs waiting list to ferry ipad and camper van much have be make about the dual role of the government appoint lord advocate who sit in the scottish cabinet while preside over prosecution in scotland what discussion have the secretary of state have with the scottish government about anas sarwar idea to split the dual role of scotland top law officer to maintain the separation of power between the government and the judiciary as the hon gentleman will know the director of public prosecutions in england be appoint by panel which remove the risk of perceive interference by government many learn friend have express their concern to about the structure in scotland and the closeness between the judiciary and the government and find their concern understandable it be vital that the public perception be that the prosecution service be very independent from government call the chair of the scottish affairs committee be sure the secretary of state will agree that his mission to constrain and bypass the scottish parliament have be an absolute disaster for devolution relationship across the uk have never be as such low level will he acknowledge that his version of aggressive unionism have utterly fail as he be leave his office will he pledge to abandon it entirely be not entirely sure what have do that have be failure to be honest this government protect devolution and the settlement if he be refer to the section order that use that be in the scotland act and be vote for at the time by snp mps it be there to protect devolution when devolve administration legislate on great britain or uk matter employment law devolution if he will have discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential merit of devolve employment law to the scottish government the uk government have no intention of devolve legislative competence for employment right to the scottish parliament employer and employee benefit hugely from single simple system where employment right be the same across great britain whether in derby or dundee we do not see any benefit from change that arrangement devolution of employment law be support by the scottish trades union congress the trades union congress worker right group majority in the scottish parliament and the public it would benefit worker by have their government compete to give they well right and prevent race to the bottom what be not to like why will the secretary of state government not consider it refer the hon gentleman to my original answer we believe it be right to have simple system that work across the united kingdom whether one be in derby or dundee do the secretary of state agree that to have different employment law either side of the border of the two nation would be mistake because it would increase the regulatory burden on company and deprive british company of our excellent tribunal system completely agree with my right hon and learn friend who absolutely make the right argument scottish work visa scheme if he will make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the potential merit of devolve the power to introduce scottish work visa scheme to the scottish government if he will make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the potential merit of devolve the power to introduce scottish work visa scheme to the scottish government if he will make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the potential merit of devolve the power to introduce scottish work visa scheme to the scottish government the united kingdom government have introduce single flexible immigration system that work in the interest of the whole united kingdom separate visa system would create an economic migration border between scotland and the rest of the uk which would be harmful for employer and far less attractive for worker last week the cbi conference raise the serious issue of lack of people to do vital job that we need fill especially in hospitality and food production both the fraser of allander institute and the highlands msp kate forbes have suggest localise worker visa solution to boost the economy why be the secretary of state not listen to those smart voice and why be he not act in the good interest of the scottish economy because we have specific scottish occupation list for shortage which give we flexibility the salary rate be set at we believe that the good way be for stakeholder body to make representation to the home office to add to the shortage occupation list five year ago the migration advisory committee say that the current system be fail remote community recently publish figure show that my argyll and bute constituency be suffer further depopulation with the town of rothesay on the isle of bute particularly badly affected despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary the government still insist that the current system deliver for all part of the uk will the secretary of state explain how one size fit all policy simultaneous catering for the vastly different need of densely populate urban area and argyll and bute can deliver equally for both argyll and bute be beautiful part of the united kingdom but what it lack be infrastructure public service and affordable housing because the scottish government have fail in all those area what it also have with the rest of scotland be the problem of be the highest tax part of the united kingdom that be the problem the scottish government have to address the uk government say that post brexit domestic employment would fill labour gap but the executive director of ukhospitality scotland have say that the gap leave by exclude eu worker have not be fill leave huge number of specialist vacancy such as for chef and manager when will this government accept reality and stop destroy scotland economy in the name of purist brexit ideology think the hon lady live in parallel universe we have the high net migration to the uk since record begin far high than when we be in the eu as say if we want to attract people to scotland we must stop make it the highest tax part of the united kingdom the secretary of state have correctly identify that there be some who want to use immigration policy to enforce hard border between england and scotland as part of their aim to break up the union do he agree and in his assessment do he identify that we need to ensure that immigration policy be not use as an alternative to offer the rewarding package that key worker deserve absolutely we be one united kingdom we have no physical border it be important that we treat immigration equally across the whole united kingdom and give everyone equal opportunity call the snp spokesperson let be clear we be talk about the administration of work permit for people from overseas who wish to work in scotland on temporary basis just about everyone think it would be well administer in scotland but the secretary of state insist that it should be centralise by his government in westminster his argument would be plausible if the uk demonstrate that it be manage the migration service well but give the catastrophe that be the uk immigration system when will he wake up and realise this would be well do in scotland by the people who live there point the hon gentleman to the seasonal agricultural worker scheme that be people with the ability to flex it up to those people come to work in flexible system across the united kingdom and it have prove to be huge success the secretary of state be stand against everyone he be stand against expert against academic against representative of industry and even against the people of scotland only of whom think immigration be too high more than six in think more immigration would benefit the country when be he go to stop be the secretary of state against scotland and be the secretary of state for scotland it be good that the hon gentleman line be write by mike russell that be an old one and not very good one the reality be that scotland be the most tax part of the united kingdom which be not attractive for people to work there we have the high ever net migration if the scottish government focus more on good public service good infrastructure and low taxation hopefully those high net migration figure will see more people settle in scotland carbon capture utilisation and storage what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on develop carbon capture utilisation and storage in scotland carbon capture utilisation and storage be vital component of our journey to net zero the acorn project represent huge opportunity for the north east of scotland as would be expect for any multi billion pound project due diligence must now be follow under westminster rule bathgate linwood methil and irvine be all no more grangemouth now risk be add to that sorry list and with it the hope of its develop carbon technology the minister be quick to attack scottish government with limited power but responsibility for the robbery and ruination of scotland energy sector and the continued denial of substantial funding for carbon capture rest squarely with the uk government what be his office do to protect energy sector job and livelihood in scotland and what be his department excuse for utterly fail the people of scotland have the pleasure of meet the cabinet secretary from the scottish government this morning together with the leader of falkirk council to discuss the situation at grangemouth the scottish government and the uk government be work together hand in hand to protect as many job as possible the scottish cluster be expect to include at least one project locate in grangemouth which be welcome news productive forestry planting whether his department have have recent discussion with the scottish government on support productive forestry planting in scotland very much welcome this question which be timely in national tree week reforestation be crucial way for we all to reduce carbon emission and improve biodiversity across the country although this policy be devolve the uk government continue to work with the devolved administration to deliver uk wide change in tree planting and establishment conifer which be the main specie plant for productive forestry account for just under half the area of uk woodland do my hon friend agree that there should now be uk wide target for of new planting to be productive forestry allow scotland to lead the way in deliver secure supply of raw material to support british manufacturing and construction thank my hon friend for her excellent question there be high ambition across the united kingdom to increase forestry planting agree that we must secure steady supply of the raw material need to support britain construction and manufacturing industry last do not normally get such cheer last week the government announce that there will be new national park and new national forest in england do the scottish government or the minister have any intention of do something similar for scotland there be great ambition for an additional national park in scotland and my scottish conservative colleague be push very hard for that if the hon gentleman need more information he should please write to will respond with the require detail promote scotland interests abroad what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on promote scotland

scotland office be do to support these important sector in the international market first thank my hon friend for his service as trade envoy and tell he that last month have the pleasure of travel to vietnam to boost scotland trade interest and celebrate diplomatic link vietnam already offer huge opportunity for scottish business and in the light of the uk recent joining of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership that be easy for you to say mr speaker be keen to highlight further trading opportunity for scottish business in the indo pacific region for the final question call patrick grady will the secretary of state clarify what he be say early and whether he think it be legitimate for scottish government ministers to be able to travel overseas to promote the work of the scottish government have always be very clear that scottish government ministers can go overseas to promote area that be devolve but the reserved area such as the constitution and foreign affair be matter for the uk government and those ministers should not be use our embassy and consulate to promote their plan for separation or their different view on the middle east or anything else before we come to prime minister question let remind member of an important courtesy that we should all observe give notice to colleague if we be visit their constituency on official business colleague in lancashire ought to think about that when they be go to other constituency and let people know when they be do so believe that do not happen on this occasion have hear of number of example in other area of this discourteous way of behave towards colleague which be not acceptable would rather we do not have to deal with such matter by point of order so please try to give notice before visit each other constituency also say to everybody that temperate and moderate language be what want in this chamber let we now move on to pmq prime minister the prime minister be ask engagements if he will list his official engagement for wednesday november this morning have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house shall have other such meeting later today last year scotland export trillion wh of electricity worth billion to the uk grid yet not only do scottish generator pay the high grid connection charge in europe but scot pay among the high standing charge while london be by far the low our heating and lighting be switch on lot early and off lot later than the south of england should scottish household be force to shiver in the dark this winter to subsidise the rich part of the uk as the hon gentleman will know stand charge be matter for ofgem the independent regulator last week it launch consultation ask for view about standing charge he will know that because of geographic factor the uk government already provide an annual cross subsidy worth to typical household in scotland but on top of that we be provide considerable support to everyone across the uk with their energy bill this year abigail mor edan be four year old release from hamas captivity last weekend abigail be an orphan after her parent be brutally execute in front of she during hamas rampage on october to secure the freedom of abigail and some other hostage israel be take huge risk release convict terrorist include would be suicide bomber israa jaabis imprison for detonate gas cylinder in her car in hamas also seem to have break the ceasefire by activate three explosive device what step be my right hon friend the prime minister take to continue his welcome steadfast support for israel in its fight against not only hamas but other iran back terror group thank my hon friend for raise such an important issue my thought and the thought of the whole house will be with abigail as have say before we support israel right to defend itself to go after hamas and to free hostage to deter further incursion and to strengthen its security for the long term we welcome the extension to the agreement to pause fighting increase humanitarian aid and release further hostage negotiation be ongoing and highly sensitive but this have be welcome first positive step we will continue to hold iran to account for any further escalation from these group as well as continue to work with partner to disrupt and deter iran destabilising activity in the middle east call the leader of the opposition in an effort to hide from his failure the prime minister spend this week argue about an ancient relic that only tiny minority of the british public have any interest in but that enough about the tory party in they all promise the country that they would control immigration say number will come down and the british people will be in control how be it go let be crystal clear the level of migration be far too high and be determined to bring they back down to sustainable level that be why we have ask the migration advisory committee to review certain element of the system we be review those finding and will bring forward next step early this year we announce the tough action ever take to reduce legal migration the effect of that action be yet to be feel but will impact student dependant forecast show that migration be likely to drop as result up until this moment all we have hear from the right hon and learn gentleman on this topic be secret backroom deal with the eu that would see an additional migrant here every year never mind the british museum it be the prime minister who have obviously lose his marble the greek prime minister come to london to meet he fellow nato member an economic ally and one of our most important partner in tackle illegal immigration instead of use that meeting to discuss those serious issue the prime minister try to humiliate he and cancel at the last minute why such small politic prime minister of course we be always happy to discuss important topic of substance with our ally like tackle illegal migration or strengthen our security but when it be clear that the purpose of the meeting be not to discuss substantive issue for the future but to grandstand and relitigate issue of the past it be not appropriate furthermore specific commitment and assurance on that topic be make to this country and then break it may seem alien to the right hon and learn gentleman but in my view when people make commitment they should keep they discuss the economy security and immigration with the greek prime minister also tell he we would not change the law regard the marble it be not that difficult the reality be simple the prime minister have no plan on boat crossing and migration be at record high his policy be that company can pay worker from abroad less than british worker and that have contribute to those record high immigration level have it not the right hon and learn gentleman talk about the boat crossing but have fail to notice that illegal boat crossing be down by third this year thank to all the action we have take which he oppose every single time they be raise no one will be surprised that he be back an eu country over britain just last week he be ask which song good sum up the labour party what do he come up with he show his true colour and choose ode to the anthem of the european union he will back brussels over britain every single time let get this straight the prime minister be now say that meet the prime minister of greece be somehow support the eu instead of discuss serious issue he have just dig far into that hole that he have make for himself rather than deal with the fact he be prosecute his one man war on reality and that reality be stick under this government bricklayer from overseas can be pay less than somebody who be already here plasterer less and an engineer less the list go on it be absurd labour would scrap his perverse wage cut policy why will he not do so as have say we have take significant measure and will bring forward more indeed as the office for national statistics itself say more recent estimate indicate slowing of immigration as result of the thing that we be do but be surprised to hear the right hon and learn gentleman now take this new position have quote here from pushy young shadow immigration minister who say to this house directly quote this person that limit on skilled migrant be form of economic report march vol who could possibly have take such bizarre position only to turn it will come as no surprise to anybody that it be he there be only one party that have lose control of the border and its member be sit right there this be government who be not just in turmoil but in open revolt the immigration minister think that the prime minister be fail because apparently nobody will listen to his secret plan the former home secretary think that he be fail because of his magical thinking the current home secretary think that he be fail he even take time out of his busy schedule of insult people in the north east to admit that he agree with labour the prime minister seem to be the only person on the tory benches without his own personal immigration plan clearly his own side do not have any faith in he why should the public it be really bit rich to hear about this from someone who describe all immigration law as racist and who literally say that it be mistake to control immigration we have take step and we will take further step which be why recent estimate show that immigration be slow it be why next year the immigration health surcharge will increase by more than two third it be why immigration fee be go up by up to one of his own front bench team say that have target be not sensible it be no surprise to have people like that because while we be take all these measure that he oppose this be the person who stand on platform and promise to defend free movement on this government watch migration have just treble and the prime minister be give the house lecture about target he be lose in la la land there can be few experience more haunting for conservative members than hear this prime minister claim that he be go to sort out problem first he say that he would get nhs waiting list down they go up unabashe by that he say that he would get control of immigration it have go up follow that experience he turn his hand to bring taxis down and would you believe it the tax burden be now go to be high than ever it be ironic that he have suddenly take such keen interest in greek culture when he have clearly become the man with the reverse midas touch everything he touch turn to perhaps the home secretary can help out rubbish interruption we might have to check the tape again mr speaker will the prime minister do the country favour and warn we what he be plan next so that we can prepare ourselves for the disaster that will inevitably follow more at the beginning of the year we say more order at the beginning of the year we say that we would halve inflation and this government have deliver ease the burden of the cost of live for family everywhere we know about the right hon and learn gentleman plan all the way through that what do he do he back inflationary pay rise and talk about welfare no control for welfare and about borrow billion year that would just make the situation bad he mention tax just this past week we have deliver the big tax cut since the for million of people and business and increase pension and benefit and this week we secure billion of new investment for this country so he can keep try to talk order can just say to the shadow foreign order just little bit quieter please want to hear the government have rightly respond to the shocking and unacceptable rise in antisemitism and we see extra funding in the autumn statement note that of religiously aggravate offence last year be against the muslim community yet in the autumn statement there be no funding to deal with islamophobia the government independent adviser on islamophobia role have be leave vacant for over one year as the prime minister know we discuss these matter over year ago yet no action have take place prime minister enough be enough with regard to tackle anti muslim hatred will the government now finally take action we will not tolerate anti muslim hatred in any form and expect it to be deal with wherever it occur actually recently meet tell mama service that provide support to victim of anti muslim hatred which we have in fact support with over million of funding since its inception we be in regular dialogue with it we have also double the funding for protective security measure through the protective security for mosque scheme and we will continue to do everything we can to keep our muslim community safe call the snp leader in good news for kid in aberdeen this morning it be snow when they look out of the kitchen window they would have be fill with delight but many of their parent who look out of the kitchen window this morning would have be fill with dread dread from know that they simply can not afford to pay their energy bill in that context do the prime minister regret offer no financial mechanism whatever for family this winter it be simply not right to say that there be not support for family this winter there have be considerable support this year for energy bill this winter pensioner household for example will receive up to alongside their winter fuel payment they be some of the most vulnerable household and it be right that they get that support at difficult time appreciate that it be difficult for the prime minister to empathise when he quite clearly can not understand but to be clear to he and indeed the whole house this be not matter of energy production scotland produce six time more gas than we consume and around two third of our electricity already come from renewable resource this be consequence of decade of fail energy policy here in westminster those of we on the scottish national party benches believe that scotland energy wealth and energy resource should benefit the people of scotland why do he the entire energy grid infrastructure in this country be integrate which bring benefit to people in every part of our united kingdom when it come to support people with energy bill early this year we increase benefit to the high rate on record it be why we provide cost of living payment worth on top of regular support it be right not to wait until the last moment to give people that support we give it to they early this year so that they would have the security they need go into winter as say on top of the money for pensioner when there be cold snap we have cold weather payment that kick in and the warm home discount which provide an extra to the most vulnerable household all that be the most considerable action take by any government to help people with their energy bill the million redevelopment of kettering general hospital be the

programme be be back by over billion of investment three scheme be already open two be open this year and be in construction or work have begin to prepare the site it be absolutely right though that

have make which come on top of the large capital programme for the nhs in its history roll out community diagnostic centre urgent treatment centre and surgical hub right across the country as disturb as be to learn that british politician be be debanke by the national westminster bank the prime minister can imagine my horror to find that an entire town bakewell in the derbyshire dale be be debanke

national westminster bank be ignore my vulnerable elderly constituent and my businessman bakewell be big thriving market town my hon friend be right that all customer wherever they live should have

threat to democracy and to take international action to provide the guardrail that believe be essential if we be to maintain integrity in the administration of justice thank my right hon and learn friend for all the work he have do in this incredibly important area he be right that we need to have guardrail around the successful exploitation of this technology which be why the online safety act give the regulator significant new power to regulate the content on social medium company include some of the one that he mention we be also work internationally follow on from the summit to ensure that we can all get the benefit of this technology but in the process safeguard our democracy which be so crucial to the functioning of our country urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net zero if she will provide an update on the uk government commitment in relation to be glad to come to the house to discuss this important subject today the upcoming cop host by the united arab emirates be an important moment in the climate crisis amid record temperature and emission the first comprehensive stocktake of progress against the paris agreement at will show that the world be badly off track we have make significant progress through the paris agreement with temperature projection shift from before paris to between and after glasgow through nationally determined contribution commitment but we know that that be not enough in glasgow we cement the goal of limit global temperature increase to as our north star that have be carry forward by the uae presidency the late science and the impact we be see even at show we why top priority for the united kingdom be to leave with clear road map towards keep in reach from the global stocktake the uk head to with record at home and internationally that we can be proud of the prime minister recently affirm our commitment to net zero and set out our new approach to get there at home we have decarbonise fast than any other major economy by since look forward our target require the large reduction in emission of any major economy two year on from glasgow the need to accelerate action be more urgent than ever the world need to decarbonise more than five time fast than we have do in the last two decade at we want to see progress against five area ambitious new commitment and action include pathway to keep within reach from the global stocktake scale up clean energy through commitment to triple renewable double energy efficiency and move beyond fossil fuel progress on finance reform deliver billion for develop economy build resilience to climate impact include by double adaptation finance and establish loss and damage fund and finally progress on restore nature action to deliver net zero be not just matter of do the right thing by avoid harm it be crucial to our security and prosperity here in the uk now and in the future the global net zero transition could be worth trillion to uk business between and uk business be in the vanguard in recognise the opportunity more than two third of ftse company and thousand of small business have pledge to reduce their emission in line with the goal under the race to zero campaign more than half the signatory to that campaign be from the united kingdom net zero be already an engine for growth and revitalisation of formerly deindustrialise area in the united kingdom at we need to show progress in deliver the historic agreement that we land in glasgow and we must use our uk expertise to scale green finance thank the minister for her response will be the most consequential climate summit since in paris yet we be way off track the un recent emission gap report warn that current pledge under the paris agreement would see temperature rise of between and this century minister be fond of say that the uk have the most ambitious nationally determine contribution for of any major economy yet the minister will also be aware of the climate change committee recent assessment that the uk be unlikely to meet its ndc that be not least because the committee calculate that just of the require emission reduction for be cover by credible government plan she will know that target without plan be cheap what concrete plan do the government have to urgently close that gap do she agree that we must see an ambitious outcome from the global stocktake with significantly strengthen ndc and new economy wide target by that see the rich country go far and fast do the minister share my outrage over report that the uae plan to use its role as president to secure oil and gas deal what assessment have she make of the impact of that on trust in the negotiation will she explain why the uk be push for the phase out of unabated fossil fuel rather than of fossil fuel in their entirety do she recognise the view of the high ambition coalition which say that we can not use abatement technology to green light fossil fuel expansion how will she ensure that any agreement that include language on abatement have real tooth deliver real cut in fossil fuel production and do not simply allow for the continuation of business as usual the minister will know that properly resource and operational loss and damage finance fund must be litmus test for success at but there be report that the government will be contribute to that fund from their exist climate finance pot do she agree that we can not tackle ever increase challenge from an ever deplete pot of money what plan do the government have for new and additional finance what innovative source of finance be they look at what assessment have they make of the impact of the uk reclassification of climate finance on climate vulnerable country if the government be serious about lead by example will they finally reverse the greenlighting of the obscene rosebank oilfield reiterate that the government take this issue incredibly seriously and there be two way of demonstrate that the minister for energy security and net zero my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart who usually deal with such issue be at and ready for the conference and we now have distinct department for this issue the department for energy security and net zero we know that we be leader in the field take this issue seriously not just for the people of the united kingdom but for the planet as whole think about my granddaughter we really do have commitment to ensure that we be do everything that we can call dr thérèse coffey interruption order ms lucas have give you an urgent question if you have problem there be no answer please the minister will answer as she see fit be sure that at the end you will want to raise point of order that be the time you can not have second bite of the cherry go out of my way to ensure that this issue be cover so please be sure other member will ask question and it be up to the minister how she answer they be not responsible for that thank you mr speaker for grant this second opportunity for the house to discuss at the debate on november when the government grant full day debate only three back benchers speak and the hon member for putney fleur anderson and for strangford jim shannon there be not sign of the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas who be now complain about the response to her question by the way the debate on november finish early because of how few people speak do my hon friend agree that vote blue go green be the good way to deliver net zero do she recognise that nature base solution be vital to achieve net zero do this not just show again that the green party be all talk and absolutely no action as have say it be incredibly important that we head towards our commitment between and we cut uk emission by while grow the economy agree with my right hon friend that if we trust this government to deliver we will ensure we be head on the right path the other thing to mention be that net zero be an engine for growth and the revitalisation of formerly industrialise area of the uk cut emission be important not just for the climate but for our economy call the shadow minister the un have warn that the world be on course for catastrophic of warming in part because promise make at and have not be fulfil we be run out of last chance we know what we need to do and we know how to do it but where be the sense of urgency the prime minister be sham into attend cop last year would have think he would be ashamed to be there this year after his climate climbdown last month derail momentum at exactly the wrong time the world need climate leadership do the minister think it be acceptable for the prime minister to sabotage the uk history of climate leadership with his cynical backtracking on net zero labour will be go to cop with message that the uk can be climate leader again and that in do so we will cut energy bill and boost energy independence at home which this government have conspicuously fail to do labour will put the uk back in position of leadership and establish clean power alliance we will pledge to issue no new oil gas or coal licence and set an example with our mission for clean power by what example do it set if the current uk government ignore the science and global consensus on fossil fuel especially when the energy secretary admit that her policy will not even cut bill labour will also be work for multilateral development bank reform to help develop country access capital as well as champion the uk as the future green finance capital of the world with mandatory align transition plan for ftse company and financial institution can the minister tell what the government will be do to advance that agenda there be so much more that the uk can and must do to reduce emission and deliver energy security to cut energy bill and to back british industry with labour britain would lead the world at cop labour be ready to lead be the minister as have mention we do take this issue incredibly seriously if think about some of the fact as the hon member rightly mention at the the prime minister announce billion to the green climate fund that be the big single funding commitment that the uk have make to help the world tackle climate change half of that contribution will go to adaptation we be committed and that be why we have presence at the house will see that senior member of the uk government be there as well as king charles this country have one of the strong record in the world on reduce emission not least give our very successful summit in glasgow what progress be be make on deliver the historic commitment to tackle deforestation make by the leader at that summit pay tribute to the work that my right hon friend have do on this subject will need to get back to she with the exact figure on deforestation if may one of the thing that the uk government be do at be make sure that we hit the five key area of progress finance global stocktake mitigation adaptation and loss and damage and within that nature call the snp spokesperson the uk government series of turn on net zero target have put our ability to meet they at risk the scottish government be commit to meet our more ambitious target but europe and the united states be lead the way as this place lag behind in turn hold scotland back can the minister confirm whether the new foreign secretary who famously decide to cut the green crap will be attend that move cost uk household billion in extra energy cost reassure the hon gentleman that we be committed to ensure we hit all those target as of september more than country account for around of global emission and more than of global gdp be cover by net zero commitment we be committed to make sure that we hit those target and that be demonstrate by our attendance at and the measure we be take to ensure we meet the climate challenge the government mobilise green investment strategy publish in march set out that we need trillion year in green finance by what be the government ambition at to agree fund anywhere close to that level what more can we do to get our private sector and pension scheme to contribute to that my hon friend make an important point we will have those discussion over the two week of we be try to ensure that we hit all the global target too be sure that those conversation will come up and we can have discussion on they later the minister can talk the talk but it be action that count business across every sector as well as expert in the field have react with horror to this government backslide and roll back on climate action and net zero in fact aviva chief executive amanda blanc say that the government be put our climate goal as country under threat and therefore job growth and investment at risk do the minister recognise the damage that be do both at home and to our global standing one of the thing that this government be commit to be ensure that we have skill in place and that the economy be go in the right direction we be proud of our record and our commitment to make sure we get to net zero be demonstrate in all the thing we have be do we be international leader world leader in our commitment to ensure that we hit those target welcome that two of the new landscape recovery scheme be in west cornwall and on scilly and credit the cornwall wildlife trust farm cornwall the duchy other organisation and in particular the landowner for their incredible work to achieve that at previous climate change conference specifically the paris summit we agree to fix our leaky home will the minister meet to discuss how we can accelerate that effort especially for low income family know what champion my hon friend be for his constituent will of course meet he although perhaps meeting with the relevant minister would be more appropriate we be committed to make sure that we have that extra security that be why we be make such an investment in work towards energy security while at the same time work towards net zero the uk be leader in offshore wind development but be now fall seriously behind cost to offshore wind developer have increase by as much as the recent offshore wind auction failure will have cost the uk gw of new renewable energy and that be entirely predictable how will the prime minister be able to look in the eye the leader of country that be suffer most from the impact of climate change and say the uk do everything it can first we be world leader on offshore energy that be one of our commitment but we do not just rest on our laurel and think about offshore wind we be also look at other way to generate electricity which be much need include fusion and small modular reactor the hon lady suggest we be not take into account where we should be go on energy but we be world leader and we be ensure that we have an impact on our future be look forward to go to cop as one of the member of the energy security and net zero committee last week the committee go to see the world first green hydrogen neighbourhood project in fife in scotland local people be give the choice to switch to innovative clean green hydrogen heating and nearly half of they have take that choice do the minister agree that one of the big challenge to achieve next zero be achieve that consumer change and that this be why it be so important that we offer consumer innovation and choice rather than the top down tax and ban approach that the opposition so often promote my hon friend make an important point it be about education ensure that people be educate and think about how we use our future energy however it be also incumbent on we to ensure that we offer choice which be why we be committed to offshore and to make sure that we be invest in science and technology and get all of that technology available thus make energy available in lot of different form after the last cop the prime minister at the time boris johnson assure the house that there would be no funding whatsoever from british source for fossil fuel development anywhere in the world since then the uk government have announce their own fossil fuel development with oil and gas extraction so how on earth do the minister expect to be take seriously at cop when britain itself be invest more in fossil fuel and then lecture the rest of the world that they should not do so can she assure we that this cop be not just go to be an exercise in greenwash with sideshow of oil dealing and that it be go to be serious attempt to deal with the serious fundamental issue that this planet face yes uk production be decline when we think about oil and gas it be important that we think about have balanced approach and make sure that we keep our supply go as it should one of the thing we be commit to be make sure that on balance we also have other option available it be important to remember that from an economic point of view the job that be create be really important from an oil and gas point of view and of course that will be invest in green energy as well so it be cyclical thing to make sure that we be invest in our future have spend year in the energy department it have be an absolute pleasure to see how civil servant business the public and indeed minister be at the forefront of ensure that the uk be the major economy that have decarbonise furth and fast in the world we account for only of emission we have the big offshore wind farm in the world as well as the second big and the third big we have more solar panel than france we really be lead the way so when we go to cop we need to make sure that other see that there be an advantage in do this and join we on that journey what will the minister message be at cop to make sure that the world join we on this journey thank my hon friend for make those point he have work closely with the department and see at first hand the work that we have be do and it be good to hear that reiterate in the house one of the thing that we be look for be success at and success would be make sure that we be support those five measure but also progress and make sure that we have commitment to the world future and make green climate the government be go into these global climate talk have announce new north sea oil and gas field if every country copy this government approach of squeeze out every last drop of oil and gas we would risk extreme global temperature rise of every respected climate body have warn of the danger of this approach so at the climate talk why should any other country listen to this government when their policy be not compatible with the uk own climate commitment of course we be commit to do other thing as well which be what be reiterate we have commitment to make sure that we learn from research and development and that we be look at offshore wind but we also need to be realistic which be why we be look at oil and gas it will have an impact on the economy and it will help towards green economy because of the investment that will be make through the oil and gas finance climate change be the single big threat to humanity and will be look forward to attend myself be pleased that it be take place in the middle east give the need to transition away from fossil fuel we seem to forget our own history because it be we in persia in mesopotamia and on the arab peninsula that get the middle east on to the road of oil and gas exploration do my hon friend agree that we be able to get our emission down today because of the offshore wind farm in the english channel and that those be the result of lot of investment from the united arab emirates it be always great pleasure to listen to my right hon friend who remind we of the history and of how we get to this point however we need to acknowledge all the good thing that we be do and reiterate that we be look at ensure sure that we have secure energy future be it not just little bit embarrassing that as ministers head to the gulf for cop the european marine energy centre in my constituency be have to consult on downsize and restructuring because the minister colleague in the department of levelling up housing and communities have be unable to provide the three year funding stream that they have previously undertake to provide will she speak to her colleague in dluhc to ensure that some certainty on that money can be give and that the centre can continue its genuinely world lead work on the development of marine renewable energy that be obviously not my department but would be happy to take that away and facilitate meeting or indeed have meeting myself new research by ulster university find that over of home in northern ireland will need to be retrofit if we be to have chance of meet our net zero target and that at the current rate of retrofit we have no chance of meet our goal do the minister believe that the support available to provider such as the northern ireland housing executive and housing association across the region be adequate to allow they to tackle the climate breakdown and fuel poverty far know the impact of climate change on the poor country in the world will the government finally make real the loss and damage fund to help those most affected to adapt and mitigate and will she ensure that that fund be new money and not just raid on exist press aid budget with the hon lady permission would prefer to write to she because part of those question be slightly outside my remit however reiterate that one of the thing we be determined to do be tackle fuel poverty that be one of the reason why we have commitment to do this also there be lot of support that people can get and would encourage everybody to get what they be entitle to have some great green innovator in my constituency but it have be heartbreake speak to they over the last few month about the impact that the government suppose reset on net zero be have on their business they include new fuel cell producer green aviation leader company provide key supply chain part to the car industry and renewable energy company their business may be different but the story be the same the lack of action from the government be make it hard for they to get investment hard for they to create job and hard for they to bring growth to mid bedfordshire my constituent ultimately see through the government shallow positioning on this issue hearteningly for but it be unfortunate that this issue continue to hang over their prospect how can we show leadership on this issue at at time when the government can not even get out of the way of people look to bring growth to my constituent this government have demonstrate commitment to investment in all these area particularly from science and technology point of view know that uk trade and investment have immense commitment and give out support for this but there be many thing that we have be do we have not just be invest in from science point of view what we be do be invest in offshore wind in alternative fuel and in all those thing that will enable we to get to where we need to be in the uk heating home account for of carbon emission and in england our home produce more emission than car do that be not only cost the environment in the future it be also cost taxpayer now decade ago the then prime minister cameron green crap riddance result in uninsulated loft and in cavity wall be leave unfilled give that that decision be now add billion in additional cost to taxpayer and make it hard to meet the decarbonisation target can the minister ask the foreign secretary whether he regret it we be invest in make sure that home be insulate and energy efficient it be worth point out that between and the uk cut emission by while grow the economy by more than can of course pass on the hon gentleman message to the foreign secretary point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker would appreciate any advice you can give on matter of great interest and concern to my constituent it relate to the attitude of national highways official in the north west office freedom of information request reveal several email that in my view show worrying lack of candour and transparency in national highways dealing with in relation to the replacement of footbridge on major road in my constituency in particular have be accuse of whip up frenzy among my constituent in relation to that important safety matter be do my job not whip up frenzy any advice from you would be welcome thank the hon gentleman for give notice of his point of order certainly agree that he or any other member should not be criticise for pursue issue of concern to their constituent the hon gentleman have put his concern on the record and believe the minister may wish to make quick point far to that point of order madam deputy speaker the hon member for bootle peter dowd be kind enough to notify of his intention to make point of order and have already begin the process of look into it it be fair to say that he be friend of mine although know that many will hold that against he he be merely do his job and will make sure that that continue be about to say that the hon gentleman might want to consider raise the issue with ministers but that have already happen be grateful to the minister and be sure that the issue will be consider between the two of they on point of order madam deputy speaker be very grateful to mr speaker for grant my urgent question but do you have any advice on what can be do when minister simply refuse to answer single question and essentially abuse the procedure of the house ask question in good faith the minister be on her foot for second during which time we learn that the secretary of state be at cop that there be department for energy security and net zero and that the minister granddaughter care lot about the planet that be all very fascinating but it do not answer single one of my question how can we do our job as member hold the government to account when ministers can stand at the dispatch box for second and not answer single question on an issue deem worthy of an urgent question thank the hon lady for her point of order but be not responsible for the answer give by ministers believe the minister would like to say something far to that point of order madam deputy speaker believe that have answer most of the question the hon lady ask in my opening remark my understanding be that be to give short response if there be anything have not respond to be happy to respond in writing my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey make the important point that there have be previous debate on this issue and suggest that if the hon lady have turn up to those debate she would have be able to have member hear hear order thank the minister for that response both the hon lady and the minister have put their view on the record be sure that there will be further opportunity after the summit for the issue to be discuss rise do not want to prolong this exchange but will allow very brief point on the point make by the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey and just now by the minister they will know that there be one person represent my party and can not be in two place at once be work on it there be conservative members and just one back bencher be at the debate last week suggest that they look at get their own house in order before criticise this side this be get way beyond anything resemble point of order

many member find he good colleague to work with and believe that he spend many hour on the channel tunnel act sometimes think that the people who do such bills on behalf of all of we deserve medal be sure the whole house send its good regard and deep condolence to his family our core job as member of parliament be the scrutiny of legislation tease out whether proposal will do what it say whether it be necessary and proportionate and whether it have public support the government have have total control of the order paper since so we can do that job properly only if the government get their act together and play ball that be what enable the line by line consideration of the law that bind we it be what make we function democracy we need to send the bill back to committee because we simply can not do that job properly today let we recall how we get here first version of the data protection and digital information bill be introduce by the previous member for mid bedfordshire on july it be such mess that it never even make it to second reading nadine dorries be sack in september last year and six month later the bill be sack as well to be replace by new and improve no bill which have its second reading on april and complete its committee stage on may that be day ago do not know what have prompt all the delay be it the general chaos in government perhaps the government do not fully understand the term with immediate effect like the minister and have know and work with he on many different issue for many year have meeting with he and his official on thursday november he tell then that on report the government would table only few minor and technical amendment to the bill which he hop everyone would be able to agree fairly easily on the last available day day after committee the government bring out amendment some be indeed minor and technical but many be very significant they strike to the heart of the independence of the new information commission they alter the right of the public in make subject access request and they amend our system in way that may or may not enhance our data adequacy with the us and the european union and therefore british business ability to rely on uk legislation to trade overseas in some instance they give very extensive new power to ministers and they introduce completely new topic that have never be previously moot debate or scrutinise by parliament in relation to this bill which already have more bauble on it than the proverbial christmas tree the end result be that we have page of amendment to consider today in single debate yes we could have table amendment to the government amendment but they would not have be selectable and we would not have be able to vote on they so the way the government have act whether knowingly recklessly or incompetently mean that the commons can not carry out line by line consideration of what will amount to more than page of new law new clause and two new schedule one of which be page long some measure will barely get minute consideration today that be not scrutiny it be blank cheque yesterday make generous offer to the minister for disabled people health and work the hon member for corby tom pursglove who be sit on the front bench and whom also like we recognise that some of the issue need to be address so we say recommit the bill so we can help you get this right in the commons and we will commit to have it out of committee in fortnight it could go to the lords with all party support by christmas let repeat this be no way to scrutinise bill particularly one that give the government sweep power and limit the right of our fellow citizen the public sadly it be part of grow trend but legislate at speed repent at leisure should not be our motto some will say something that be commonly say these day let it go through to the lords so they can amend it but be sick of abdicate responsibility for get legislation right it be our responsibility we should not send bills through that be at good half consider we be the elect representative we can not just pass the parcel to the lords we need to do our job properly we can not do that today without recommit the bill begin by join the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant in express the condolence of the house to his predecessor allan rogers he serve as member of parliament during my first nine year in this place remember he as an assiduous constituency member of parliament and be sure we all share the sentiment express by the hon gentleman it be pleasure to return to the dispatch box to lead the house through report stage of the bill we spend considerable time discuss it in committee but the hon gentleman be not in his post at that time welcome he to his position he may regret that he miss out on committee stage which make he keen to return to it today the bill be an essential piece of legislation that will update the uk data law make they among the most effective in the world we scrutinise it in depth in committee the hon gentleman be right that the government have table number of amendment for the house to consider today and he have do the same the vast majority be technical and the number sound large because lot be consequential on original amendment one or two address new aspect and will be happy to speak to those as we go through they during this afternoon debate nevertheless they represent important addition to the bill the minister for disabled people health and work my hon friend the member for corby tom pursglove who be sit next to have draw the house attention to the fact that amend the bill to allow the department for work and pensions access to financial datum will make significant contribution to identify fraud would have think that the opposition would welcome that it be not new measure it be contain in the fraud plan that the government publish back in may the government have be examine that measure and we have always make it clear that we would bring it forward at an appropriate parliamentary time when vehicle be available this be data bill and the measure be specific to it we estimate that it will result in saving to the taxpayer of around million by the end of be surprised that the opposition should question that as say the bill have be consider at length in committee it be important that we consider it on report in order that it achieve the next stage of its progress through parliament on that basis reject the motion question put debbie abrahams tahir ali mike amesbury fleur anderson tonia antoniazzi paula

confusion which have impede the effective use of personal datum to drive growth and competition and to support key innovation the bill seize on post brexit opportunity to build on our exist foundation and create an innovative flexible and risk base datum protection regime this bespoke model will unlock the immense possibility of datum use to improve the life of everyone in the uk and help make the uk the most innovative society in the world through science and technology want to make it absolutely clear that the bill will continue to maintain the high standard of datum protection that the british people rightly expect but it will also help those who use our datum to make our life healthy safe and more prosperous that be because we have convene industry leader and expert to co design the bill at every step of the way we have hold numerous roundtable with both industry expert in the field and campaign group the outcome believe be that the legislation will ensure our regulation reflect the way real people live their life and run their business be grateful to the minister for give way so early oxford west and abingdon have huge number of spin off and scientific business that have express concern that any material deviation on standard particularly european union datum adequacy would entangle they in more red tape rather than remove it he say he have speak to industry leader have he and his department assess the risk of any deviation be there any associated cost to business from any potential deviation who be go to bear that cost share the hon lady appreciation of the importance of datum adequacy with the european union it be not the case that we have to replicate every aspect of gdpr to be assess as adequate by the european union for the purpose of datum exchange indeed number of other country have datum adequacy even though they do not have precisely the same framework of data protection legislation in draw up the measure in the bill we have be very clear that we do not wish to put data adequacy at risk and we be confident that nothing in the bill do so that be not only my view it be the view of the expert witness who give evidence in committee it be also the view of the information commissioner who have be closely involve in all the measure before we today recognise the concern but do not believe it have any ground the minister say we do not wish be that guarantee from the dispatch box that there will be absolutely no deviation that cause material difference for business on eu datum adequacy can he give that guarantee can guarantee that there be nothing in the government proposal that we believe put data adequacy at risk that be not just our view it be the view of all those we have consult include the information commissioner he be previously the information commissioner in new zealand which have its own data protection law but be nevertheless recognise as adequate by the eu he be very familiar with the process require to achieve and keep datum adequacy and it be his view as well as our that the bill achieve that objective we believe the government amendment will strengthen the fundamental element of the bill and reflect the government commitment to unleash the power of datum across our economy and society have already thank all the external stakeholder who have work with we to ensure that the bill function at its good take together we believe these amendment will benefit the economy by billion over the next year that be more than double the estimate impact of the bill when it be introduce in the spring will the minister confirm that no service will rely on digital identity check will come on to that because we have table few amendment on digital verification and the accreditation of digital identity we be propose voluntary framework we believe that use digital identity have many advantage and those will become great as the technology improve but there be no compulsory or mandatory element to the use of digital identity understand why the hon lady raise that point and be happy to give she that assurance before my right hon friend move on to the specific of the government amendment may ask he about something they do not yet cover the bill do not address the availability of datum to researcher so that they can assist in the process of for example identify pattern in online safety he will know that there be considerable discussion of this during the passage of the online safety act when succession of ministers say that we might return to the subject in this bill will he update the house on how that be go when might we expect to see amendment to deal with this important area it be true that we do not have government amendment to that effect but it be central part of the bill that we have already debate in committee make datum more available to researcher be indeed an objective of the bill and share my right hon and learn friend view that it will produce great value if he think more need to be do in specific area would be very happy to talk to he far or to respond in writing there be quite number of technical amendment as the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant observe will start with the uk us datum access agreement which permit telecommunication operator in the uk to share information about serious crime with law enforcement agency in the us and vice versa government new clause make it clear that the uk us datum access agreement and other specify international treaty can provide basis for processing under several ground in the uk gdpr this agreement have be operational since october and disclosure make under it be not prevent by the current data protection legislation however the measure contain in the new clause will make it absolutely clear to telecom operator in the uk that the data access agreement provide an appropriate legal basis for process personal datum special category datum and criminal offence datum under the relevant provision in the uk gdpr we have also table an amendment to ensure that follow the loss of the eu general principle of proportionality at the end of as result of the retained eu law revocation and reform act controller continue to need only to carry out reasonable and proportionate search for information when respond to subject access request while controller should make the good possible effort to locate all the information request by data subject there be occasion when this might be unreasonable or disproportionate such as when the information be of low importance or of low relevance to the data subject in those circumstance it be important to continue to allow controller to limit the effort they make when search for information and this position reflect exist domestic case law the amendment simply provide great legal certainty for controller turn to the information commissioner office code of practice we have listen to concern about the perceive impact of the approval power on the independence of regulator so we be amend the bill to remove the veto power on the content of ico statutory code of practice it be previously propose that the power should be hold by the secretary of state interruption welcome the expression of enthusiasm for this amendment from the hon member for rhondda this amendment balance regulatory independence with democratic accountability and reaffirm the government commitment to the independence of our regulatory framework and it be support by the ico the amendment introduce new process for the approval of ico statutory code of practice and it provide that the information commissioner must consider recommendation from the secretary of state about code of practice prior to the code be lay before parliament critically the information commissioner will not be bind by the secretary of state recommendation we be also introduce an amendment to clarify the way in which the ico can serve notice and to remove the outdated requirement for the ico to obtain consent before serve notice by email this amendment will enable the ico to enforce the uk datum protection regime more effectively particularly against overseas business and it mirror the arrangement that number of other regulator already have although most data controller do the right thing and respond to subject access request in satisfactory way some dispute end up in court so we have table an amendment that will enable court to require information from controller to assess whether it should have be provide as part of the original response while ensure that the information be not disclose to the claimant until it have be determine whether or not they be entitle to it the hon member for brent central dawn butler mention the digital identity verification scheme in part the uk digital identity and attribute trust framework set out baseline rule that organisation must follow to become government approve digital verification service provider however in some case where people may choose to use digital identity product such as when apply for mortgage or complete pre employment check digital verification service provider may need to follow rule in addition to those within the trust framework in order to meet sector specific requirement our amendment enable additional rule which be describe as supplementary code in the bill to be approve by the government against condition set out in the trust framework organisation will be able to prove that the digital verification service they offer be certify against supplementary code as well as the trust framework by have note include in the digital verification service register let turn to one or two example cover both the right to rent and right to work check it be essential that the employment and private rental sector be provide with robust and secure process to ensure that the identity check part of their onboarding process be secure efficient and effective the home office will use the amend part power have just explain to make secondary legislation that mean that when an employer or landlord be use the service of digital verification service provider they do so from the register of digital verification service provider establish under part of the bill that do not change the already establish process available to employer and landlord in fact provider have already be certify to perform digital right to work and right to rent check in line with the exist version of the uk digital identity and attribute trust framework to which have refer the amendment will provide confidence and security to employer and landlord that the service provider they be use be certify our ongoing engagement with the sector tell we that the use of digital identity service provider be welcome development as it represent more cost effective practice than manual check of physical document provider of public electronic communication service such as company that provide mobile phone contract be currently require to report all personal datum breach to the information commissioner within hour our amendment ease burden on industry by give more time for those datum controller to report data breach they will now have to be report without undue delay and where feasible no later than hour after the breach this change will allow organisation to gather more detailed information about the breach before the reporting deadline and allow the ico to focus its effort on assess that information once it have be achieve on disclosure for the purpose of archive in the public interest the government recognise the importance of archive in permanently preserve britain rich history for long term social benefit we also know that archivist currently have very little agency to dictate what lawful ground be use when obtain personal datum from wide range of source we be therefore amend the bill to ensure that controller be able to reuse personal datum for the purpose of archive in the public interest regardless of the lawful ground the personal datum be originally collect on that will be particularly helpful for archivist that be not public authority and be therefore unable to use public task lawful ground for their processing we have work closely with the national archives in bring forward our amendment come to the issue of foreign conviction particularly those relate to counter terrorism policing we intend to amend the bill to ensure that counter terrorism policing can continue to protect british citizen by retain biometric receive from international partner in more efficient way currently the police can hold biometric indefinitely for people who have conviction for shoplift in the uk but not for convict terrorist abroad our amendment that will enable the indefinite retention of an individual fingerprint and dna profile for national security purpose where that person have foreign conviction that be equivalent to conviction in england wales or northern ireland counter terrorism policing can retain those biometric without the need to apply for national security determination our amendment bring the counter terrorism act into alignment with other legislation govern biometric retention we be make change to the way that counter terrorism policing can retain biometric share via interpol it will now be able to retain biometric datum in national security relate case for as long as the relevant interpol notice remain in force rather than need to submit national security determination which can present significant operational challenge for counter terrorism policing that will bring the uk into line with the rule under which all interpol member retain and use those same biometric our amendment be request and be welcome by counter terrorism policing the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation the office of the biometrics commissioner and the security service and thank they for their co operation on this aspect of the bill broadly speak we support this measure what negotiation and discussion have the minister have about red notice under interpol and the abuse of they for instance by the russian state we have concern about decent people be maltreat by the russian state through the use of red notice be those concern conflict by the measure that the government be introduce as the hon gentleman know strongly share his view about the need to act against abuse of legal procedure by the russian state as he will appreciate this aspect of the bill emanate from the home office however have no doubt that my colleague in the home office will have hear the perfectly valid point he make hope that they will be able to provide he with further information about it and will draw the matter to their attention wish to say just few more word about the biometric material receive from our international partner as tool in protect the public from harm sometimes counter terrorism police receive biometric from international partner with identifiable information under current law they be not allow to retain these biometric unless they be take in the past three year that can make it hard for our counter terrorism police to carry out their job effectively that be why we be make change to allow the police to take proactive step to pseudonymise biometric datum receive from international partner obviously that mean hold the material without include information that identify the person and hold indefinitely under exist provision in the counter terrorism act information that identify the person it relate to again those change have be request by counter terrorism police and will support they to well protect the british public the national underground asset register or nuar be digital map that will improve both the efficiency and safety of underground work by provide secure access to privately and publicly own location datum about the pipe and cable beneath our foot this will underpin the government priority to get the economy grow by expedite project such as new road new house and broadband roll out the hon gentleman and also share considerable interest in that the nuar will bring together valuable datum from more than public and private sector organisation about the location of underground utility asset this will deliver million per year of economic growth through increase efficiency reduce asset strike and reduce disruption for citizen and business once operational the running of the register will be fund by those who benefit most the government amendment include power to through regulation levy charge on apparatus owner and request relevant information the introduction of reasonable charge payable by those who benefit from the service rather than the taxpayer will ensure that the nuar be sustainable service for the future other amendment will ensure that there be the ability to realise the full potential of this datum for other high value us while respect the right of asset owner be any consideration give to the fact that that information could be use by bad actor if people be able to find out where particular cable or pipe be they also have the ability to find weakness in the system which could have implication for we all understand the hon lady point there would need to be legitimate purpose for access such information and be happy to supply she with further detail about precisely how that work the hon lady intervene at an appropriate point because be about to say that the provision will allow the national underground asset register service to operate in england and wales we intend to bring forward equivalent provision as the bill progress in the other house subject to the usual agreement to allow the service to operate in northern ireland but the scottish road works commissioner currently maintain its own register it have help we in the development of the nuar so the hon lady may like to talk to the scottish road works commissioner on that point turn to the use of datum for the purpose of democratic engagement which be an issue of considerable interest to member of the house the bill include provision to facilitate the responsible use of personal datum by elect representative register political party and other for the purpose of democratic engagement we have table further relate amendment for consideration today include add full definition of what constitute democratic engagement activity to help the reader understand that term wherever it appear in the legislation the amendment provide for former mp to continue to process personal datum follow successful recall petition to enable they to complete urgent casework or hand over casework to successor as they do follow the dissolution of parliament for consistency related amendment be make to the definition use in provision relate to direct marketing for the purpose of democratic engagement finally hon member may be aware that the data protection act currently permit register political party to process sensitive political opinion datum without consent for the purpose of their political activity the exemption do not however currently apply to elect representative candidate recall petitioner and permit participant in referendum the amendment address that anomaly and allow those individual to benefit from the same exemption as register political party be the minister prepare to look at how the proposal in the bill and the amendment align with relevant legislation pass in the scottish government number of framework bills to govern the operation of potential future referendum on variety of subject have be pass particularly the referendums scotland act it be important that there be alignment with the definition use in the bill such as that for permit participant will he commit to look at that and if necessary make change to the bill at later stage in its progress in discussion with the scottish government be happy to look at that as the hon gentleman suggest hope the change we be make to the bill will provide great legal certainty for mp and other who undertake the processing of personal datum for the purpose of democratic engagement the bill start and end with reduce burden on business and above all on small business which account for over of uk firm in the future organisation will need to keep record of their processing activity only when those activity be likely to result in high risk to individual some organisation have query whether that mean they will have to keep record in relation to all their activity if only some of their processing activity be high risk that be not the government intention to maximise the benefit to business and other organisation the amendment make it absolutely clear that organisation have to keep record only in relation to their high risk processing activity the online safety act take crucial step to shield our child and it be also important that we support grieve family who be seek answer after tragic event where child have take their own life by remove obstacle to access social medium information that could be relevant to the coroner investigation we welcome such measure but be the minister aware of the case of breck bednar who be groom and then murder his family be campaign not just for new clause but for measure that go far in that case the coroner would have want access to breck online life but as it currently stand new clause do not provide what the family need without change to widen the scope of the amendment to the online safety act will the minister look at that think it will just require tweak in some of the wording understand the concern of the hon lady we want to do all that we can to support the bereaved parent of child who have lose their life as it stand the amendment will require ofcom follow notification from coroner to issue information notice to specify provider of online service require they to hold datum they may have relate to deceased child use of online service in circumstance where the coroner suspect the child have take their own life which could later be require by coroner as relevant to an inquest we will continue to work with bereaved family and member of the other place who have raise concern during the passage of the online safety act my noble colleague lord parkinson of whitley bay make it clear that we be aware of the importance of datum preservation to bereaved parent coroner and other involve in investigation it be very important that we get this right hear what the hon lady say and give she an assurance that we will continue to work across government with the ministry of justice and other in ensure that we do so the hon member for rhondda make reference to propose new schedule relate to improve our ability to identify and tackle fraud in the welfare system be grateful for the support of the minister for disabled people health and work my hon friend the member for corby tom pursglove in the department for work and pensions overpay billion in fraud and error major area of loss be the under declaration of financial asset which we can not currently tackle through exist power give the need to address the scale of fraud and error in the welfare system we need to modernise and strengthen the legal framework to allow the department for work and pensions to keep pace with change and stand up to future fraud challenge as indicate early the fraud plan publish in contain provision outline the dwp intention to bring forward new power that would boost access to datum hold by third party the amendment will enable the dwp to access datum hold by third party at scale where the information signal potential fraud or error that will allow the dwp to detect fraud and error more proactively and protect taxpayer money from fall into the hand of fraudster my reading of the propose new schedule be that it give the department the power to look into the bank account of people claim the state pension be right about that the purpose of the propose new schedule be narrowly focused it will ensure that where benefit claimant may also have considerable financial asset that be flag with the dwp for further examination but it do not allow people to go through the content of people bank account it be an alarm system where financial institution that hold account of benefit claimant can match those against financial asset so where it appear fraud might be take place they can refer that to the department but it do include the state pension do it be surprised that the opposition regard this as something to question obviously they be entitle to seek further information but would hope that they share the wish to identify where fraud be take place and take action against it this be about claimant of benefit include universal credit pension the state pension will not currently be an area of focus for the use of these power the house of commons library make it absolutely clear that the bill if take forward in the way that the government be propose at the moment do allow the government to look at people in receipt of state pension that be the case be it not can tell the hon gentleman that it be not the case that the dwp intend to focus on the state pension and that be confirm by my hon friend the member for corby this be specifically about ensure that mean relate benefit claimant be eligible for the benefit for which they be currently claim in do that the identification and the avoidance of fraud will save the taxpayer considerable amount of money think everybody in the house understand the importance of get this right we all want to stop fraud in the state system that be say this be the only time that be aware of where the state seek the right to put people under surveillance without prior suspicion and therefore such power have to be restrict very carefully indeed as we be not go to have time to debate this properly today be my right hon friend open to have further discussion on this issue when the bill go to the lords so that we can seek further restriction do not mean to undermine the effectiveness of the action just want to make it more targeted be very grateful to my right hon friend for his contribution and share his principled concern that the power of the state should be limit to those that be absolutely necessary those who be in receipt of benefit fund by the taxpayer have an obligation to meet the term of those benefit and this provision be one way of ensure that they do so my hon friend the member for corby have already say that he would be very happy to discuss this matter with my right hon friend far and be happy to do the same if that be helpful to he can the minister give we an example of the circumstance in which the department would need to look into the bank account of people claim state pension in order to tackle the fraud problem why be the state pension within the scope of this amendment all can say to the right hon gentleman be that the government have make it clear that there be no intention to focus on claimant of the state pension that be an undertaking that have be give be sure that ministers from the dwp would be happy to give further evidence to the right hon gentleman who may well wish to look at this far in his committee finally wish to touch on the framework around smart datum which be contain in part of the bill the smart datum power will extend the government ability to introduce smart data scheme build on the success of open banking which be the uk most develop datum sharing scheme with more than million active user the amendment will support the government ability to meet their commitment first to provide open banking with long term regulatory framework and secondly to establish an open data scheme for road fuel price it will also more generally strengthen the toolkit available to government to deliver future smart data scheme the amendment ensure that the range of datum and activity essential to smart datum scheme be well capture and more accurately define that include type of financial datum and payment activity that be integral to open banking the amendment as say be complicated and technical and therefore will not go into further detail rise will give way to my hon friend as know that he have take particular interest and be very knowledgeable in this area the minister be very kind just want to pick up on his last point about smart datum he be right to say that the provision be incredibly important and potentially extremely valuable to the economy can he just clarify couple of point want to be clear on government new clause about interface body do that apply to the kind of new data standard that will be require under smart datum if it do can he please clarify how he will make sure that we do not end up with multiple different standard for each sector of our economy it be absolutely in everybody interest that the standard be interoperable and to the great possible extent common between sector so that they can talk to each other do have note on interface body which be happy to include for the benefit of my hon friend however he will be aware that this be technical and complicated area if he want to pursue further discussion would of course be happy to oblige can tell he that the amendment will ensure that smart data scheme can replicate and build on the open banking model by allow the government to require interface body to be set up by member of the scheme interface body will play similar role to that of the open banking implementation entity develop common standard on arrangement for datum sharing learn from the lesson and success of the open banking regime regulation will be able to specify the responsibility and requirement for interface body and ensure appropriate accountability to regulator hope that that go some way to address the point that he make but would be happy to discuss it far with he in due course believe these amendment will generally improve the functioning of the bill and address some specific concern that have identify on that basis commend they to the house call the shadow minister as be feel generous shall start with the nice bit where we agree with the government first we completely agree with the change to the information commissioner office strengthen the ico enforcement power restructure the ico and provide clear framework of objective as the minister know we have always be keen to strengthen the independence of the ico and we be concerned that the government be take new interventionist power that be quite theme in this bill in clause so we welcome government amendment which achieve much well balance between democratic oversight and ico independence so we thank the minister for that labour also welcome part of the bill as amend in committee establish digital verification framework my concern however be that the government have underestimate the sheer technicality of such an endeavour hence the last minute requirement for ten of government amendment to this part of the bill which note the minister keep on refer to as be very technical and therefore good to be debate in another place at another time with official present under government amendment for example different rule will be establish for different digital verification service and be not quite sure whether that will stand the test of the house of lords we warmly welcome and support part of the bill which have just be refer to by the hon member for weston super mare john penrose and the minister and its provision on smart datum indeed we and many industry specialist have be urge the government to go much fast in this particular area the potential for introduce smart data scheme be vast empower consumer to make financial decision that well suit they enable innovation and deliver well product and service most notably that have already happen in relation to financial service many people will not know that that be what they be use when they use software that be access several different bank account but that be what they be do in the autumn statement the government pledge to kickstart smart datum big bang one area where smart datum have be most effective be in open finance it be right that we expand these provision into new area to have great social impact but to quote the financial conduct authority it should be implement there in proportionate phase manner ideally drive by consideration of credible consumer proposition and use case furthermore the fca do not think that big bang approach to open finance be feasible or desirable nevertheless many of the government amendment to the suite of smart datum provision be technical and indicate move in the right direction in particular we hope that with smart datum enable great access by consumer to information about green option and net zero we will be able to help the whole of the uk to move towards net zero want to say few word on part on cooky and nuisance call we share lot of the government intention on tackle those issue and the birth and death register as former registrar would like to see tombstone the process of fraudulently adopt for oneself the name of child who have die bring to an end that practice be enable partly because the death register do not actually register the death of an individual name on the birth register which hope will at some point be possible despite the government have sit on the bill for almost month with extensive consultation draft amendment and carry over motion there be still big practical hole in these measure that need to be address labour support the government ambition to tackle nuisance call which be blight on people life we all know that however fear that clause which establish duty to notify the ico of unlawful direct marketing will make little or no difference without the addition of labour amendment and which would implement those obligation on electronic communication company when the guidance from the ico on their practical application have be clearly establish as the bill stand that be little more than wishful thinking unfortunately the story be the same on tackle cooky we have bunch of half bake measure that simply do not deliver as the public will expect they to and the government would like they to we all support reduce cookie fatigue be sure that every hon member happily click accept all whenever cooky come well some member be much more assiduous than be in that regard but the wise members of the house know perfectly well that the problem be that it undermine the whole purpose of cooky we all support tackle it because click new cookie banner every time we load web page be waste of everybody time and be deeply annoying however the government propose regulation give the secretary of state blank cheque to make provision as they see fit without proper parliamentary scrutiny that be why we be unhappy with it and have table amendment which would remove those power from the bill as they be simply not ready to enter the statute book yet again make the point that the bill repeatedly and regularly give new power to the secretary of state sure they would be implement by secondary legislation but as we all know secondary legislation be unamendable and therefore subject to much less scrutiny these be area in which the state be take significant power over the public and private individual let deal with some of the labour party amendment first take subject access request the government have repeatedly be in the wrong place on those be afraid ever since the introduction of the first iteration of the dpdi bill under nadine dorries when they try to charge people for access to their own datum fortunately that have now go the way of nadine dorries interruption note that the minister smile at that point we still have concern about the government plan to change the threshold for refuse subject access request from manifestly unfounded or excessive to vexatious or excessive the equality and human rights commission reset the tuc and which have all outline their opposition to the change which threaten to hollow out what the government themselves admit be critical transparency mechanism we have table two simple amendment amendment would establish an obligation on any data controller refuse subject access request to provide evidence of why request have be consider vexatious or excessive organisation should not be allow to just declare that request be vexatious or excessive and so ascribe motive to the data subject in order to refuse to provide their datum perhaps simply because of the inconvenience to the organisation the government will try to tell that safeguard be in place and that the datum subject can make appropriate complaint to the organisation and the ico if they believe that their request have be wrongly refuse but if we take the provision set out in clause to extend the time limit on subject access request add the advantage for company of dither and delay when consider procedural complaint and then add the additional burden on data subject of have to seek out the ico and produce evidence and an explanation of their request as well as the alleged misapplication of the vexatious or excessive standard we see that people could easily be wait year and year before have the right to access their own datum can not believe that in the end that be in the interest of good government or that it be really what the government want despite public opposition to the measure the government be also now go far by introduce at this stage amendment that further water down subject access request protection government new clause and which the minister do not refer to in fact he only mention think bare tenth of the amendment he want we to agree this afternoon limit data subject entitlement to their own datum to the controller ability to conduct reasonable and proportionate search but what be reasonable and proportionate who determine what have be reasonable and proportionate search the new clause drive coach and horse through the right of people to access their own datum and to know who be do what with their information that be why labour do not support the change come to one of the most important issue for we high risk processing which as the term suggest be of most concern when it come to the right of individual be pleased but perplex to see that the government table amendment to new clause that add further clarity about the change provision to record keeping for the purpose of high risk processing be pleased because it be right that safeguard should be in place when datum processing be deem to be of high risk but be perplex because the government do not define high risk processing in the bill in fact they have remove the exist standard for high risk processing from exist gdpr thereby leave legislative lacuna for the ico to fill in that should not be up to the ico know that the ico himself think that it should not be up to he but matter for primary legislation our amendment retain statutory definition of high risk processing as recommend by the ico in his response to the bill publish in may he say the detail in article be helpful and clear legislative backstop that be why he support what we be suggest our amendment would also clarify those individual right even far by again provide the necessary definition of what constitute high risk within the new provision concern the responsibility of senior responsible individual for datum processing set out in clause turn to automate decision making which have the potential to deliver increasingly personalised and efficient service to increase productivity and to reduce administrative hurdle while most of the world be make it hard to make decision exclusively use adm clause in the bill extend the potential for automated decision making in the uk yet countless research project have show that automate decision making and machine decision making be not as impartial or blind as they sound algorithms can harbour and enhance inbuilt prejudice and injustice of course we can not bury our head in the sand and pretend that the technology will not be implement or that we can legislate it out of use we should be smart about adm and try to unlock its potential while mitigate its potential danger where people livelihood be at risk or where decision be go to have significant impact it be essential that extra protection be in place allow individual to contest decision and secure human review as fundamental backstop our amendment strike well balance by extend the safeguard provision to include significant decision that be base both partly and solely on automate processing be very hopeful that the government will accept our amendment that mean great safeguard for anybody subject to an automate decision make process however that decision be make it can not just be matter of the computer say no think the minister be slightly surprised that we be concerned about democratic engagement but will explain the bill introduce several change to electoral practice under the guise of what the government call democratic engagement most notably through clause and the former mean that any political party or elect representative could engage in direct marketing rely on soft opt in procedure while clause allow the secretary of state to make any future exemption and change to direct marketing rule for the very unspecified purpose of democratic engagement the ada lovelace institute and the internet advertising bureau have raise concern about that and in committee labour ask the minister what the government have in mind he rather give the game away when he write to my hon friend the member for barnsley east stephanie peacock to whom pay tribute for the way she take the bill through the committee future government may want to encourage democratic engagement in the run up to an election by temporarily switch off some of the direct marketing rule switch off the rule ahead of an election do anyone else smell rat the government ask we to trust they but when they change the rule on voting refuse automatic registration of voter and dramatically increase the amount that they can spend on general election all to benefit their own party interest forgive if worry that they be try to slip yet another change through just before an election that will enable the tories to mine people information for vote that be why be doubly suspicious of clause and the first seem to make legal practice that suspect several conservative mp be already engage in use datum acquire as an mp for the wholly different purpose of seek re election as candidate the second be major power grab by the secretary of state enable they to change the direct marketing rule for election with the bare minimum of scrutiny clause should be rewrite to remove the soft opt in in provision for political party and elect representative and clause should be scrap the change be not support by the majority of respondent to the government initial consultation who want the privacy and electronic communications ec directive regulations rule to be uphold and they will not be support by labour today in address government amendment the minister offer suppose explanation of what democratic engagement mean but it be basically literally anything that anybody could do in political party or as an elect representative do not think that he clarify it if anything he just extend it will refer briefly to amendment table by the hon member for aberconwy robin millar who be in his place moment ah he have move of course interoperability of datum in the health service between all the different part of the united kingdom be devoutly to be wish for in fact it would be quite nice if gp surgery be able to have full interoperability between one another be tell the other day that we have million resident in wales but something like million patient record which suggest that something be not quite right there be similar number think for england wales and northern ireland so of course we need to get to place of great interoperability be nervous about the amendment simply because the welsh government have not be consult do not know about the scottish government or other do not want to stir the devolution pot in way that be unhelpful so we will abstain on the amendment the hon member be look pregnant with something do not know whether he intend to intervene indicate dissent he do not great finally new schedule would grant the secretary of state the power to require bank or other financial institution to provide the bank account datum unspecified of any recipient of benefit to identify case which merit further consideration to establish whether relevant benefit be be pay or have be pay in accordance with the enactment and rule of law relate to those benefit it be very broad and would argue poorly delineate power my understanding from the commons library although note that the minister be unable to answer the question properly be that it include the bank account of anyone in the uk in receipt or have be in receipt of state pension universal credit work tax credit child tax credit child benefit pension credit jobseeker allowance or personal independence payment the minister say that the government do not intend to go down some of those route at the moment but why in that case be they seek that power they could have come to we with much more tightly write piece of legislation and we would have be able to help they draft it properly the propose new schedule would mean that million of bank account could be trawl without the department for work and pensions as the right hon member for haltemprice and howden mr davis refer to even suspect anything untoward before it ask for the information the page new schedule which be table on the last day for consideration would grant power to the government without our have any opportunity to scrutinise it line by line assess its implication or hear evidence from expert witness we should of course be tackle fraud the government have completely lose control of fraud in recent year with benefit fraud and error skyrocket to billion in the last financial year the minister seem to think that it be good thing that he could cite that figure the year before it be even high record billion on the conservative party watch the percentage of benefit expenditure lose to fraud have more than treble since labour be last in power let be absolutely clear labour will pursue the fraudster the conman and the claimant who try to take money from the public purse fraudulently or illegally that include those who have defraud the taxpayer over personal protective equipment contract or have not declare their full income to his majesty revenue and customs my constituent in the rhondda know that defraud the taxpayer be one of the bad form of theft it be theft from all of we it undermine confidence in the system that so many rely on it anger people when they abide by the rule and they see other swing the lead and get away with it back any attempt to tackle fraud in the system and we will work with the government to get the legislation right but this be not the way to do it because it be not proper scrutiny the minister with responsibility for this matter the minister for disabled people health and work who be present in the chamber be not even speak in the debate the government be ask we to take lot on trust as we see from the question put early to the minister for data and digital infrastructure so have some more question for he that hope he will be able to answer as understand it the government do test project on this in all of six year ago so what on earth have they be do all this while when be the new schedule first draft and why do the minister not mention it in the discussion that he and have two week ago how many bank account do it potentially apply to the government already have power to seek bank detail where they suspect fraud so precisely how will the new power be use have be tell that the government will not use the power until be that right if so how on earth do they come to the figure of million saving that be the figure that they give yesterday but note that the minister say million early in the first five year what will the cost be to the bank and financial institution what kind of information will the government seek will it include detail of where people have shop bank or travel or what they have spend their money on the government say that they will introduce set of criterion specify the power when will that be introduce how wide in scope will it be what assessment will accompany it and will it be subject to parliamentary scrutiny there be clearly significant potential to use datum to identify fraud and error that be something that labour be determined to do but it be vital that new measure be use fairly and proportionately the department for work and pensions say that its ability to test for unfair impact across protect characteristic be limited and the national audit office have also warn that machine learn risk bias towards certain vulnerable people or group with protect characteristic without proper safeguard in place the change could have significant adverse effect on the most vulnerable people in society on behalf of the whole labour party reiterate the offer that make to the government yesterday we need to get this right we will work with ministers to get it right and very much hope that we can organise meeting after today if the bill pass to ensure that the debate in the lords be well informed and that we get to much well understanding of what the government intend and how we can get this right if we get it wrong we will undermine trust in the whole data system and in government broadly speak labour support the change in the bill that give great clarity and flexibility to researcher tech platform and public service provider with common sense change to datum protection where it be overly rigid but the government do not need to water down essential protection for datum subject to do that our amendment set out clearly where we diverge from the government and how labour would do thing differently by maintain subject access request protection establish definition of high risk processing on the face of the bill and defend the public from automated decision make that encroach too significantly on people life bill with labour amendment would unlock the new potential for datum that improve public service protect worker from datum power imbalance and deliver cut edge scientific research while also build trust for consumer and citizen that be the data protection regime the uk need and that be the protection labour government would have deliver before speak to my new clause want to address one or two of the thing that the opposition spokesman the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant just raise by not accept his motion to recommit the bill to committee we have in effect delegate large part of the work on this important bill to the house of lords say directly to the whip on the treasury bench that when the bill come back to the commons in ping pong recommend that the whips office allow considerable time for we to debate the change that the lords make at the end of the day this house be responsible to our constituent and these issue will have direct impact on they so we ought to have strong say over what be do with respect to this bill new clause in my name be entitle right to use non digital verification service digitisation have have tremendous benefit for society administrative task that once take week or even year can now be do in second thank to technology but that technology have come with considerable risk as well as problem of access the internet be an equaliser in many way can access website and service in east yorkshire in the same way that we do here can send and receive money contact friend and family organise family do work and do all sort of other thing that we could not once do however the reality be more nuanced some people lack the technological literacy or simply the hardware to get online and make the most of what be out there think of elderly people the homeless and those live on the breadline as with many thing those group risk be leave behind by the onward march of technology through no fault of their own indeed some people do not want to go fully online many people who be perfectly au fait with the late gadget be none the less deeply concerned about the security of their datum and who can blame they my bank account have be access from israel in the past my online email have be break into during political battle of one sort or another these thing be risky hope nobody in the chamber have forget the edward snowden revelation about the national security agency and gchq which reveal vast network of covert surveillance and datum gathering by government agency from ordinary online activity and the sharing of private information without consent more recently we have hear how government agency monitor people social medium post during the pandemic and datum trading by private company be an enormous and lucrative industry what be more as time pass and the rise of artificial intelligence take hold the ability to make use of central database be become formidable it be beyond imagination so people be properly cautious about what datum they share and how they share it for some people this be where the issue be directly relevant to this bill that caution will mean avoid the use of digital identity verification and for other that digital verification be simply inaccessible the bill therefore create two serious problem by its underlying assumption already it be become extremely difficult for people to live anything approach normal life if they be not fully wire into the online network if they can not even verify who they be without that access what be they suppose to do that be why want to create right to offline verification and in effect offline identification we see early this year what can happen when someone be exclude from basic service with the plan closure of nigel farage bank account that case be not relate to identification but it make clear how much of an impact such exclusion can have on someone life those who can not or do not wish to verify their identity digitally could end up in the same position as farage and many other who have see their access to banking restrict for unfair reason the rise of online banking although great convenience for many must not mean certain other be leave out we be talk about fairly fundamental right here those people who by inclination or otherwise find it preferable or easy to stick to old fashioned way must not be exclude from society my amendment would require that all service require identity verification offer non digital alternative ensure that everyone regardless of who they be will have the same access that non digital alternative could take number of form it could simply mean work with the post office to allow people to verify their identity in person or have people post in copy of their exist identity document passport drive licence and the like the specific route be not the most important thing what matter be that people have choice and be not coerce into provide the datum through digital mean whether their reason be concern about their privacy or something else some may worry about what that mean for digital only service such as some of the so call challenger bank but there be nothing to stop such service remain online and simply outsource the non digital alternative for verification to trust third party with physical capacity it be only right that those bank like everyone else offer service to everyone regardless of how they want to prove who they be it may well be in fact think it be quite likely that series of organisation such as solicitor bank and other institution go into the business of provide physical rather than online verification some year ago in the face of opposition in this place and in the country at large the blair government abandon identity card the reason the card be oppose be the central control of single piece of datum about individual it be not about the card but about the central control of datum that problem still apply today and people should still worry about it this bill mark another step into the rapidly advance new world of technology it be crucial that we get this right now if we make presumption in this bill that lead to people have to depend on online identification we will create problem down the road that we have not foresee say to the minister on the front bench that will not press my new clause to vote this time but hope the government will look properly at create that right during the bill passage through the lords it seem to perfectly sensible and intelligent thing for the government to undertake the last point want to make relate to the issue that the minister for disabled people health and work my hon friend the member for corby tom pursglove raise to be fair to he he raise they with before they come to the house and agree with he that something like what he be propose be necessary but it need to be really severely constrain there be already commercial method for do some of the thing he want to do that be less intrusive than what the government have propose again hope we can talk to he in the interim between the bill clearing this house and its go to the lords be sure that the opposition have get the same aim here to get an outcome that be fair to ordinary people but protect the taxpayer from the massive fraud that the minister be try to stop it be difficult to know where to start the minister describe this as brexit opportunitie bill of course brexit be suppose to be about this place take back control it be to be the triumph of parliamentary sovereignty over faceless brussels bureaucrat the end of red tape and regulation and the beginning of glorious new era of freedom unencumbered by all those complicated european union rule and requirement that do silly thing like keep people safe and protect their human right yet here we be with page of new rule and regulation and further page of amendment this time last week the amendment paper be page long today it be time that and there be barely any time for any kind of proper scrutiny be this what brexit be for to hand the government yet more sweeping power to regulate and legislate without any meaningful oversight in this place to create additional burden on business and public service just for the sake of be different from the european union the answer to those question be probably yes will speak briefly to the snp amendment but will also consider some of the most concern government proposition be shoehorn in at the last minute in the hope that no one will notice how else be we suppose to treat government new schedule the minister be try to present it as benign or even helpful as if it have be the government intention all along to grant the dwp power to go snoop around in people bank account but if it have be so long in come as he say why be it be add to the bill only now why be it not in the original draft or even bring to committee where there could at least have be detailed scrutiny or the opportunity to table further amendment of course there should be action to tackle benefit fraud we all agree on that but the dwp already have power under section of the social security administration act to issue notice to bank to share bank account information provide that they have reasonable ground to believe that an identify particular person have commit or intend to commit benefit offence in other word where there be suspicion of fraud the dwp can undertake check on claimant account incidentally there should also be action to tackle tax evasion and tax fraud the government evidently do not require from the bill any new power in that area so we can only assume that they be satisfied that they have all the power they need and that everything possible be be do to ensure that everybody pay the tax that they owe the power in new schedule go much far than the power that the dwp already have by their own admission the government will allow the dwp to carry out proactively regularly at scale and on speculative basis check on the bank account and finance of claimant the new schedule provide little in the way of safeguard or reassurance for people who may be subject to such check the secretary of state say that only minimum amount of datum will be access and only in instance which show potential risk of fraud and error in that case why be the power need at all give that the government already have the power to investigate where there be suspicion of fraud and how can only minimum amount of datum be access when the government say in the same breath that they want to be able to carry out those check proactively and at scale my hon friend probably share my concern that we be move into new era in which the bank account detail of people claim with the dwp must be share as matter of course that be the only reason can see for such sweeping amendment which will impact on so many people there be huge risk it be clear that the government starting point be very often to avoid give people the social security and welfare support that they might need to live dignified life we know that the approach in scotland be incredibly different that be the thing as with so much of this bill there be good chance that minority group or people with protect characteristic will find themselves most at risk of those check and of come under the proactive suspicion of the dwp as we say when move the committal motion we have not have time to seek properly to interrogate that point in his attempt to answer intervention the minister kind of demonstrate why scrutiny have be so inadequate at the same time the government own back benchers include the right hon member for haltemprice and howden mr davis the hon member for yeovil mr fysh and other be table quite thoughtful amendment that be never great sign for government the government should not be afraid of the kind of safeguard and protection that they be propose the snp amendment look to remove the most dangerous and damaging aspect of the bill or at the very least to amend they slightly our new clause and amendment would have the effect of transfer the power of the surveillance camera commissioner to the investigatory powers commissioner that should not be all that controversial professor william webster director of the centre for research into information surveillance and privacy have warn that the bill as it stand do not provide adequate mechanism for the governance and oversight of surveillance camera the amendment would ensure that oversight be retain the use of cctv continue to be regulate and public confidence in such technology be strengthen not erode cctv be become more pervasive in the modern world not least with the rise of video doorbell and similar device that people can use in their own personal circumstance so it be concern that the government be seek to weaken rather than strengthen protection in that area the snp amendment would leave out clause and our amendment would leave out clause remove the government attempt to crack down on subject access request the effect of those clause might in the government mind remove red tape from business and other data control organisation but it would do so at the cost of individual access to their own personal datum that be typify by the creation of new and worryingly vague criterion of vexatious or excessive as ground to refuse subject access request although that might make life easy for datum controller it will ultimately place restriction on datum subject ability to access what be we must remember their datum there have be attempt not just throughout committee stage but even today from the opposition to clarify exactly the threshold for vexatious and excessive request the government have be unable to answer so those clause should not be allow to stand amendment also seek to leave out clause express the concern of many stakeholder about the expansion in scope of automated decision making alongside an erosion of exist protection against automated decision making the ada lovelace institute state that against an already poor landscape of redress and accountability in case of ai harm the bill change will far erode the safeguard provide by underlie regulation there be already significant and public concern about ai and its increasingly pervasive impact clause fail to offer adequate protection against automated decision making an individual may grant consent for the processing of their datum indeed they might have no choice but to do so but that do not mean that they will fully understand or appreciate how that datum will be process or importantly how decision will be make at the very least the government should accept our amendment which would require the controller to inform the datum subject when an automated decision have be take in relation to the data subject suspect however that that be unlikely just as it be unlikely that the government will accept labour amendment and which we be happy to support so hope the house will have chance to express its view on clause as whole later on the snp amendment and would have the effect of remove clause and respectively those clause give the home secretary significant new power to authorise the police to access personal datum and power to issue national security certificate tell the police that they do not need to comply with many important data protection law and rule that they would otherwise have to obey which would essentially give police immunity should they use personal datum in way that would otherwise be illegal and they would no long need to respond to request under the freedom of information act we have hear no explanation from the government for why they think that the police should be allow to break the law and operate under cover of darkness the bill will also expand what count as an intelligence service for the purpose of datum protection law again that would be at the home secretary discretion with power to issue designation notice allow law enforcement body to take advantage of the more relaxed rule in the data protection act otherwise design for the intelligence agency whenever they be collaborate with the security service the government might argue that that create simplified legal framework but in reality it will hand massive amount of people personal information to the police include the private communication of people in the uk and information about their health history political belief religious belief and private life neither the amend approach to national security certificate nor the new designation notice regime would be reviewable by the court and give that there be no duty to report to parliament parliament might never find out how and when the power have be use if the home secretary say that the police need to use those increase power in relation to national security his word would be final that include the power to handle sensitive datum in way that would otherwise under current legislation be criminal the home secretary be responsible for both approve and review designation notice only person who be directly affect by such notice will be able to challenge it yet the home secretary would have the power to keep the notice secret mean that those affect would not even know about it and could not possibly challenge it those be expansive broadening not just of the power of the secretary of state but of the police and security service the government have not offer any meaningful reassurance about how those power will be apply or what oversight will exist which be why our amendment propose scrap those clause entirely there remain other concern about many aspect of the bill the british medical association and the national aids trust have both raise question about patient and worker right to privacy the bma call the bill departure from the exist high standard of datum protection for health datum we welcome the amendment to that area particularly amendment table by the hon member for jarrow kate osborne which we will be happy to support should it be select for vote be afraid that have to echo the concern express by the labour front bench spokesman the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant about new clause which be table by the hon member for aberconwy robin millar that clause perhaps have laudable aim but it be the view of the scottish national party that it be not for this place to legislate in that way certainly not without consultation and ideally not without consent from the devolved authority we look forward to hear the hon member for aberconwy make his case but do not think we be in position to support his new clause at this time the theme of an erosion of public confidence in datum handling and the use of artificial intelligence come through in many of the stakeholder response to the bill that be precisely the opposite of what the government say they set out to do the claim of massive saving from reduced red tape also do not stand up to scrutiny the government own impact assessment say that company will save just year on average as result of the reform that the bill introduce we echo some of the official opposition concern about the bill democratic engagement clause it be important for party candidate and elect member to have clarity about their position in relation to the handling of personal datum but that should not be at the expense of the right of voter to have their personal datum duly protect as say to the minister in an intervention hope he will look at the definition of permit participant in clause and schedule take account of legislation that have be pass by the scottish parliament and expand it from have the same meaning as in the political parties elections and referendums act to include the definition in the referendums scotland act on the whole there be far too much in the bill and far too little time to interrogate it all properly remove some of the most pernicious clause or make amendment here and there would fundamentally do little to reduce the many risk that the bill present to individual right to privacy and to have their datum protect from pry eye in government or elsewhere and the cost and pressure on business and third sector organisation try to comply with the regime the government have table significant new power at the last minute through new clause and schedule that by definition can not have have the scrutiny they deserve as such although in principle we can support sensible amendment from both side of the house we will oppose many of the government new clause and schedule and especially give that the house have decide not to recommit the bill for further scrutiny expect we will also oppose it on third reading it be pleasure to follow the hon member who have speak in this very important debate declare an interest be the chair of the all party parliamentary group on digital identity so have particular interest in the ramification of datum as it relate to identity but also in wide concept some of which we have hear about today such as artificial intelligence and how our datum might be use in the future share quite lot of the concern that we have hear from both side of the house there be an awful lot more work to be do on the detail of the bill think about its implication for individual and business how our system work and how our public service interact with they and how our security and police force interact with our datum hope that noble member of the other place will think very hard about those thing and hope my right hon friend the minister will meet to discuss some of the detail of the bill and any useful new clause or amendment that the government might introduce in the other place completely agree that we do not have much time today to go through all the detail with substantial number of new clause have be add in just the past few day will speak specifically to some of the amendment that stand in my name essentially they be in two grouping one group deal with the operation of the trust framework for the digital verification service which will come back to and the other general area be the henry viii style power that the bill give to ministers those power fundamentally alter the balance that have be in place since be elect as member of parliament in term of how individual and their datum relate to the state on artificial intelligence we be at moment in human evolution where the decision that we make that scientist researcher and company make about how they use datum be absolutely fundamental to the operation of so many area of our life we need to be incredibly careful about what we do to regulate ai and think about how it operate be concerned that we have large tech company whose business model for decade have be nothing other than to use people datum to create product for their own benefit and that of their shareholder during the passage of the online safety act we debate very fully in this house what the implication of the algorithm they develop might be for our child health for example completely agree with the government that we should be look for way to stamp out fraud and should think about how harm of various kind be address however we need to be mindful of the big risk that fear and belief that be not necessarily true about different potential harm might lead we to regulate or to guide the operation of company and other in such way that we create real problem we be talk about very capable artificial intelligence system and also about artificial intelligence system that claim to be very capable but be inherently flawed the big tech company be almost all championing and sponsor large language model for artificial intelligence system that be train on datum those company will lobby ministers all the time say we want you to enable we to get more and more of people datum because that datum be of business value to they give the henry viii power that exist in the bill there be clear and present danger that future minister would not cast aspersion on the current eminent occupant of the front bench who be wykehamist to boot may be tempt or persuade in the wrong direction by the very powerful data generate interest of those big tech firm as such my amendment and be design to remove from the bill what the government be propose effectively that ministers will have the power to totally recategorise what kind of datum can legitimately be share with third party of one kind or another as mention that fundamentally change the balance between individual and the state through amendment and new schedule propose that when ministers implement the trust framework within the digital verification service that framework should be base on principle that have be accept for the eight year since be elect in particular those use by the government in establish the framework around its verify online identity service for public service that framework should be use in the context of the bill to think about what decision maker should be take into account it be system of principle that have be through consultation and have be broadly accept it be something that the ico accept and champion and it would be entirely right and not at all divergence from our current system to put those principle in place what would say about the legitimate interest recognition extension the henry viii power be that there be already indication in the bill about what will be recategorise it give an idea of just how broad the categorisation could be and therefore how potentially dangerous it will be if that process be not follow or be not correctly frame for example in relation to direct marketing direct marketing can mean all sort of thing but it be essentially any type of direct advertising in any mode use personal datum to target advertising and think it be really dangerous to take such broad approach to it before company share datum or use datum they should have to think about what the balance be between legitimate interest and the data right privacy right and all the other right that people may have in relation to their datum we do not want to give they loophole or way out of have to think about that be very pro innovation and pro efficiency but do not believe it be inefficient for company and user or holder of datum to have to make those basic balance judgment it be no skin off their nose at all this should be something we uphold because these interest be vital to our human condition the last thing we want be an artificial intelligence model large language model make decision about we serve we with thing base on our personal datum and even leak that personal datum highlight that only yesterday or the day before new academic report be produce show that some of the large language model be leak personal datum on which they have be train even though the company say that that be impossible the researcher have manage to get around the alignment guardrail that these ai company say they have in place so we can not necessarily believe what the big tech company say the behaviour of these thing be go to be at the end of the day large language model which be just about statistic and correlation can not tell we why they have do something or anything about the chain of causality behind such situation and they inherently get thing wrong anyone make claim that they be reliable or can be rely on to handle personal datum be think completely wrong hope that noble lords and ladies will think carefully about that matter and re table amendment similar to mine new clause and the follow new clause that the government have table on interface body show the extent to which these new system and decision about new system and how they interface with different public service and other body be totally extensible within the framework of the bill without further regard to minority or to law except in so far as there may be case for judicial review by an individual or company that really be the only safeguard that there will be under these henry viii clause the interface body provision talk about authorised party be able to share datum we have hear how the cookie system be very bad at the moment at effectively reflect what individual true preference might or might not be about their personal datum it be worth highlight the thoughtful comment we hear early about way in which people can make more of real time decision about particular issue that may be relevant to they but about which they may not have think at all when they authorise such decision in dark or non thinking moment often some time before want to say little more about the operation of the digital verification service system my amendment to deal with the way in which those operation occur we should think about whether it be correct that the minister should in effect just be able to make up whatever the fee system might be think that be problem and it be something that member of the industry engage in digital id for example have raise with there be some issue about how people or company may be deregistere from the verification system and the trust mark that will supposedly be put in place by this new government registration process that could actually be very serious for an individual and if they be suddenly say not to be trust it could be of massive import to they there should be some process for think about and consult on how such deregistration decision be make what avenue for challenge there may be and so on hope those in the other place will think very hard about those thing too know that minister have think about dvs as voluntary system rather than something absolutely require in law for everybody handle datum however we all know that system that be set up to establish trust become very difficult for someone who want to run business or to do thing because if they do not have the trust mark that will become real issue it be also very simple step from such system to have fully regulate body even if it be not ostensibly fully regulate body in law there would be chilling effect for those who do not have the trust mark so think that be really important to think about properly the final amendment of mine that want to speak to be amendment on zero knowledge proof many people in the country will not know what they be and know about they only because have be engage in think about digital system digital asset blockchain and all the technical aspect of that for some time in essence they be way that digital system can share datum status in other word know what someone datum status be with each other third party and so on without any risk that that datum would be transmit or see by anybody else it be of particular use in relation to privacy and the right to privacy that we have talk about before as currently draft the bill do not differentiate the processing of datum in way that do not expose the datum or the status of the datum relative to the holder of datum from process that do so it would be highly valuable if such decentralised system zero knowledge system of proof of particular data status be specifically exclude from the legislation so that it be very clear that they will not fall under potential regulation or the potential chilling effect the side benefit be that we would also avoid the inevitable centralisation that would otherwise occur of particular big data holder or big data operator that can afford to be register and do all such thing finish by urge the government to think hard about this stuff it might seem troublesome and they might want to forge ahead and do innovative thing and all the rest of it but this be such serious moment in our history as species the way that data be handle be now fundamental to basic human right and would increasingly argue to the human condition people such as the like of sam altman and so on in the us be openly talk about ai integration with human and the acceleration of ai big debate be go on between those who want to accelerate thing and those who want to decelerate they it will be accelerate because we can not stop researcher and scientist do thing but if we put the wrong framework in place and allow the wrong datum to be shareable in the wrong way that could have huge consequence for we say to those in the other place as well as to those on the front benches that we have not be able to go through this in detail but we should think about it incredibly hard it might seem an esoteric and arcane matter but it be not people might not currently be interested in the in and out of how ai and datum work but in future you can bet your bottom dollar that ai and datum will be interested in they urge the government to work with we to get this right have now to announce the result of today defer division on the draft strikes minimum service levels nhs ambulance services and the nhs patient transport service regulations the ayes be and the noes be so the ayes have it the division list be publish at the end of today debate rise to speak specifically to government new clause and connected government amendment which as we have be remind give ministers power to inspect the bank account of anyone claim social security benefit think it have be confirm that that include child benefit and the state pension as well as universal credit and all the other extremely wide power be be give to ministers the minister tell we that the measure be expect to save some half billion pound over the next five year be pleased that the minister for disabled people health and work be present at the start of the debate although he be not now in his place and the department for work and pensions be not hear the concern express about this measure the minister for data and digital infrastructure tell we that the minister for disabled people health and work will not be not speak in the debate so we will not hear what the dwp think about these concern we have also be tell have not see this assurance that these power will not be use for few year if that be correct be completely mystify by why this be be do in such way if we have few year to get these power in place why do the government not wait until there be some appropriate draft legislation that could be properly scrutinise rather than bring such measure forward now with zero commons scrutiny and no opportunity for that to occur there will no doubt be scrutiny in the other place but surely measure of this kind ought to undergo scrutiny in this house chair the work and pensions committee and we have receive substantial concern about this measure include from citizens advice the child poverty action group say that it should be that people have few right include to privacy than everyone else in the uk simply because they be on benefit think that sum up what lot of people feel although it appear to be the position that the government be now take it be surprising that the conservative party be bring forward such major expansion of state power to pry into the affair of private citizen and particularly do so in such way that we be not able to scrutinise what it be plan as we have be remind the state have long have power where there be ground for suspect that benefit fraud have be commit the proposal in the bill be for surveillance where there be absolutely no suspicion at all which be substantial expansion of the state power to intrude annabel denham deputy comment editor at the daily telegraph warn in the spectator of such measure hand authority the power to snoop on people bank account suspect that the view express there be more likely to find support on the conservative benches than on the labour benches so be increasingly puzzle by why the government think this be an appropriate way to act wonder whether the fact that there have be such warning prompt ministers into rush through the measure in this deeply unsatisfactory way without an opportunity for proper scrutiny because they think that if there have be parliamentary scrutiny there would be substantial opposition from the conservative benches as well as from the labour benches it be difficult to understand otherwise why it be be do in this way as we have be remind new clause will give the government the right to inspect the bank account of anyone who claim state pension which be all of we it will give the government the right to look into the bank account of every single one of we at some point during our life without suspect that we have ever do anything wrong and without tell we that they be do it the minister say early that the power of the state should be limit to those absolutely necessary and have always understand that to be principle of the conservative party yet on the power in the new clause to look into the bank account of everybody claim state pension he be unable to give we any reason why the government should do such thing or why they would ever need to look into the bank account of people everybody claim state pension what on earth would the government need to do that for the entitlement to the state pension be not base on income saving or anything like that so why would the government ever wish to do that if we can not think of reason why the government would want to do that why be they now take the power to enable they to do so think that all of we would agree whatever party we be in that the power of the state should be limit to those absolutely necessary the power in the new clause be definitely not absolutely necessary indeed no one have be able to come up with any reason for why it would ever be use there be something call production order if somebody be under investigation for benefit fraud an application could be make before court for the production of bank account if it be matter of suspect fraud there be already mechanism available yes there be clear and long establish right in law for the dwp to look into people bank account if there be suspicion of fraud this power be give the department the ability to look into the bank account of people where there be no suspicion at all all of we at some point in our life claim social security benefit and we be give the government the power to look into our bank account with this measure the minister rightly mention that the idea first appear in dwp paper in may last year that speak of the need to balance this power against people right to privacy and to ensure that the new power be appropriate be no more than necessary and have the right check in place those proposal have be moot in may of last year should have be publish we should have be able to see what exactly the proposal be there should then have be an opportunity for discussion they should have be consult on and there be plenty of time between last may and now to do all that instead the first we see of this measure be last week and there have be no consultation at all since that initial mooting of the idea in may last year if the minister can give any explanation for why that dreadful course of behaviour and procedure have be follow we would all be interested it seem to incapable of be defend the amendment give the government extremely broad power with no check in place and it have be do in way that minimise parliamentary scrutiny of what be propose find it very hard to see how that can possibly be defend no doubt the minister will tell we that at some point there will be some document set out check and balance and so on but that need to be part of this scrutiny it should not be that the government take it all away to come back in few month time to tell we how they will constrain the use of this power finally it occur to that the power be introduce could be use to establish benefit eligibility for people who do not currently claim benefit we know for example that large number of people do not claim pension credit but be eligible for it lot of the information about whether they be entitle to pension credit be already hold in the public sector and in local council in particular if it be possible to check whether people have less than the threshold saving level that could help in establish eligibility for pension credit automatically can the minister tell we whether that be intend with this proposal rise to speak to new clause in my name and that of other colleague early this year meet with member of leicestershire police federation who raise concern about element of the data protection act that be impose unnecessary and burdensome redaction obligation on police force thank the national police federation for its tireless campaign on this issue particularly ben hudson of suffolk police and thank my hon friend the member for waveney peter aldous for all he have do in this area thank they for much of the information will share today as explain in committee part of the act implement the law enforcement directive and make provision for datum processing by competent authority include police force and the crown prosecution service for law enforcement purpose paragraph of the enforcement directive emphasise that the free flow of personal datum between competent authority for the purpose of the prevention investigation detection or prosecution of criminal offence should be facilitate while ensure high level of protection of personal datum however part of the act contain no provision at all to facilitate the free flow of personal datum between the police and the cps instead it impose burdensome obligation on the police require they to redact personal datum from information transfer to the cps those obligation be only delay and obstruct the expeditious progress of the criminal justice system and be not even mandate by the law enforcement directive the problem have arise due to chapter of part of the act which set out six datum protection principle that apply to data processing by competent authority for law enforcement purpose section state the first data protection principle be that the processing of personal datum for any of the law enforcement purpose must be lawful and fair section state the processing of personal datum for any of the law enforcement purpose be lawful only if and to the extent that it be base on law and either the data subject have give consent to the processing for that purpose or the processing be necessary for the performance of task carry out for that purpose by competent authority the police federation have say that it be unlikely that section will apply in this context it have also say that in the case of the test of whether the processing be necessary be exact require competent authority to apply its mind to the proportionality of process specific item of personal datum for the particular law enforcement purpose in question under section to where the processing be sensitive processing an even more rigorous test apply require among other thing that the processing be strictly necessary for the law enforcement purpose in question section state the third data protection principle be that personal datum process for any of the law enforcement purpose must be adequate relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which it be process for the purpose of the act the crown prosecution service and each police force be separate competent authority and separate datum controller therefore as set out in section the cps and each police force must comply with the data protection principle transfer of information by police force to the cps amount to the processing of personal datum the test of necessary and strictly necessary under the first and third datum protection principle require competent authority to identify and consider each and every item of personal datum contain within the information that it be intend to process and to consider whether it be necessary for that item of personal datum to be process in the manner intend the impact of this be that when prepare case file for charge decision from the cps the police must spend huge amount of time and resource analyse information that have be gather by investigate officer in order to identify every item of personal datum they then have to decide whether it be necessary or in many case strictly necessary for the cps to consider each item of personal datum when make its charge decision and to redact every item of personal datum that do not meet that test the national police chiefs council and the cps have produce detailed guidance on this redaction process it emphasise that the act be legal requirement and that the police and the cps do not have any special relationship that negate the need to redact and protect personal information the combination of the requirement of the guidance and of the act represent huge amount of administrative work for police officer result in hour of prepare appropriate redaction furthermore such work be inevitably carry out by relatively junior officer who have no particular expertise in data protection and much of it may never be use by the cps if the matter be not charge or if the defendant plead guilty before trial nationally about of case that be submit to the cps be not charge significant proportion of that time and money could be save if the redaction of personal datum by the police occur after rather than before charge decision have be make by the cps the burden that this be place on police force be highlight in the annual review of disclosure by the attorney general office which hear evidence from police that redaction of material for disclosure be place significant pressure on resource it also find that one police force have invest million in disclosure specialist team solely to deal with redaction in its report on police priority the home affairs committee state the national police chiefs council and the college of policing say this labour intensive process tie up police resource for protect period of time mean investigation take long and possibly add to the likelihood of victim withdraw their support for case the college note that the problem have become bad as digital device such as phone and laptop have develop ever great storage capacity mean there be more datum for the police to process and redact disparity in digital capability across the local force also exacerbate the problem the report go on to say lengthy and inefficient redaction process and protract investigation be neither effective nor fair on either victim or suspect the handling of case file need to comply with data protection law however ensure that the requirement be proportionate and that force have the digital capacity to meet such requirement efficiently be an urgent issue that need address more need to be do to pilot solution and get the balance right furthermore the police federation and the national police chiefs council estimate that the cost nationally of the redaction exercise be over million per annum there be no disputing that there be clear issue here and welcome that this have be acknowledge by ministers have be engage with include the minister for crime policing and fire my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp the former home secretary my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham suella braverman and the minister for data and digital infrastructure the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale only last week the latter emphasise to the government support for reform indeed the autumn statement last week highlight the government commitment to boost public sector productivity by run an ambitious public sector productivity programme with all departments to reimagine the way public service be deliver the focus of that will be on reduce the amount of time our key frontline worker include police doctor and nurse spend on administrative task that be to ensure that they can spend more time deliver for the public arguably the current process of datum redaction be the big unnecessary administrative task keep police officer away from the frontline so reform need to be implement urgently my new clause lay out blueprint for that reform and would insert propose new section into the act to exempt the police service and the cps from comply with the first data protection principle except in so far as that principle require process to be fair or with the third data protection principle when prepare case file for submission to the cps for charge decision thereby facilitate the free flow of personal datum between the police and the cps if the cps decide to charge the case file would be return to the police to carry out the redaction exercise before there be any risk of the file be disclose to any person or body other than the cps in the of case in which the cps decide not to charge the unredacted file would simply be delete by the cps my new clause would have no obvious disadvantage as the security of the personal datum would not be compromise and the necessary redaction would still be undertake once charging decision have be make furthermore provide material unredacted to the cps pre charge would not impact the timeliness of the process in any way as the police would still be provide the same material to the cps as they would have do previously just unredacted know from my conversation with ministers that there be few question from number of source about whether legislative change be the good way to tackle the issue surround redaction to that the police federation have say that the hope be that the cps will set out within their charge advice what material they intend to rely upon and therefore only the require material will have to be redact by the police this would be do in line with the maximum time of service set out within the well case management handbook jan which state that service be require no less than five day before the hearing so we must accept that there may be slight delay in the cps be able to serve their case on the defence at the point of charge but the time in which it will take police force to apply for charge decision to the cps will be far quick without the need for redact thus stop defendant be on bail or under release under investigation status for as long as they currently be and victim of crime wait less time for charge decision in addition the police federation have highlight that while auto redaction software will help to mitigate the current issue it will not recover all policing capacity in respect of redaction officer will still need to review the item to consider what auto redaction parameter need apply otherwise police could risk end up with mass over redaction and have to check to ensure nothing have be miss the real benefit for auto redaction software will come post charge especially if the cps state exactly what material it intend to use or disclose also appreciate that the government feel they can not support my amendment because of three technical legal point and would like to summarise the police federation response to this base on advice from its lead counsel who be experience in the field of datum protection and privacy the government first objection be that there be provision in the act other than the first and third data protection principle that in effect require the material concern to be review and redact the two example give by the home office be the sixth datum protection principle and section the sixth data protection principle datum security do not require case file to be redact the same standard of appropriate technical or organisational measure be require whether case file be redact before or after the cps have make charge decision the police federation lead counsel have point out that section of the act already contain potentially relevant restriction on data subject right those restriction during an investigation would be consistent with an amendment provide for the police to redact any give case file only after the cps have decide to charge on the home office second objection that broad amendment may be problematic for the ico and international stakeholder the legal expert have highlight that the propose new clause seek only to determine the respective responsibility of the police and the cps in the processing involve in prepare and submit case file to the cps for charge decision it would not remove any substantive protection or the obligation to review and redact the personal datum in case file material it simply provide for such review and redaction by the police after rather than before charge decision have be make the law enforcement directive on which the relevant part of the act be base would have permit that when the act be pass and be tell there be no legal reason why it can not be introduce now on the home office third objection that other privacy law might require the police to review and redact case file even if the act be amend in the manner suggest by the police federation the legal expert have point out that datum protection legislation do not generally seek to regulate other privacy protect law the impact of the act on journalism be good example as the journalism exemption in part of schedule do not seek to regulate the common law tort of misuse of private information data protection legislation should be appropriately calibrate in particular area even if other legal rule may also have role in that area at present the data protection obligation give rise to the problem the legal expert believe that it be mere speculation whether other legal rule might give rise to similar problem if those obligation be amend it be crucial that we do everything possible to ease the administrative burden on police officer to free up thousand of police hour and get police back on to the frontline support community and tackle crime my new clause would go long way to achieve that by facilitate the free flow of personal datum between the police and the cps which would speed up the criminal justice process and reduce the burden on the taxpayer stated aim of the government how disheartening it must be for police officer to take time and patience redact datum only to find that the case do not go forward as occur in of case common sense must prevail rise to speak to the six amendment that have table to the bill be grateful to mr speaker for select amendment which will press to vote it be an extremely important amendment that hope will unite member across the house and thank the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady for confirm his party support for it add mine and that of the labour party too thank my hon friend for that have be contact by many people and organisation about issue with the bill the british medical association and the national aids trust have serious concern which share about the sharing of healthcare datum and the failure to consider the negative impact of lose public trust in how the healthcare system manage datum the bill be an opportunity to adapt the uk data law to strengthen accountability and data processing but it currently fail to do so it provide multiple henry viii power that will enable future secretaries of state to avoid parliamentary scrutiny and write their own rule it undermine the independence of the information commissioner office in way that provide less protection to individual and give more power to the government to restrict and interfere with the role of the commissioner the government last minute amendment to their own bill to change the rule on direct marketing in election and give themselves extensive access to the bank account of benefit claimant risk alienate people even far hope the house tell ministers that it be entirely improper in fact it be completely unacceptable for the government to make those amendment which require full parliamentary scrutiny at this late stage we know people already do not trust the government with nhs health datum the bill must not erode public trust even more we have see concern about datum with gp surgery and the recent decision to award palantir the contract for the nhs federate data platform yougov survey show that only of people trust the government to use datum about they ethically imagine that figure be much low now how do the government plan to establish trust with the million of people on pension credit state pension universal credit child benefit and other whose bank account million of bank account they will be able to access under the bill as my hon friend the member for rhondda sir chris bryant and other have ask legislative power already exist where benefit fraud be suspect so why be the amendment necessary my amendment seek to ensure that special category datum such as that relate to person health be adequately protect in workplace setting as the bill be currently word it could allow employer to share an employee personal datum within their organisation without justifiable reason the health datum of all worker will be at risk if the amendment fall we must ensure that employee personal datum include health datum be adequately protect in workplace setting and not share with individual who do not need to process it the national aids trust be concern that the bill current wording could mean that people hiv status can be share without their consent in the workplace use the justification that it be necessary for administrative purpose that could put people live with hiv at risk of harassment and discrimination in the workplace the sharing of individual hiv status can lead to people live with hiv experience further discrimination and increase their risk of harassment or even violence be concern about the removal of check on the police processing of an individual personal datum we must have such check the house have hear of previous incident involve people live with hiv whose hiv status be share without their consent by police officer both internally within their police station and in the wide community they serve ensure that police officer must justify why they have access an individual personal data be vital for evidence in case of police misconduct include where person hiv status be share inappropriately by the police or when not relevant to an investigation into criminal activity the bill be not robust enough on the transfer of datum internationally we need to ensure that there be mandated annual review of the data protection test for each country so that the data protection regime be secure and that people personal datum such as their identity or hiv status will not be share inappropriately identity be criminalise in many country and the transfer of personal datum to those country could put an individual their partner or their family member at real risk of harm have table six amendment which would clarify what an administrative purpose be when organisation process employee personal datum retain the duty on police force to justify why they have access an individual personal datum ensure that third country datum protection test be review annually and ensure that the secretary of state seek the view of the information commissioner when assess other country suitability for the international transfer of datum urge all member to vote for amendment and urge the government and the other place to take on board all the point raise in today debate and in amendment to in my name rise to speak to new clause which give its low number everyone will realise table pretty early in the bill passage it address the smart datum clause that sit as block in the middle of the bill it be wonderful to see the degree of cross party support for the smart datum measure the shadow minister remark show that the labour front bench have drink deeply from the kool aid in the same way as the rest of we it be vital that the measure move forward as fast and as safely as possible because they have huge potential for our economy and our gdp growth as the minister rightly say they seek to build on the undoubted world lead success of our exist position in open banking my new clause be fairly straightforward and hope that the minister will elaborate in his closing remark on the two further measure that it seek which and number of other people urge the secretary of state to take in letter back in july to underline the breadth of support for the measure the letter be sign by the chief datum and analytic officer of the natwest group lead figure in the financial data and technology association the co founder and chief executive officer of ozone api the director general of the payments association the founder and chief executive of icebreaker one who be incidentally now also chair of the smart data council the founder of open banking excellence and the ceo of the investing and saving alliance be make not only cross party point but point that have widespread support among the very organisation involve in smart datum and particularly the open banking success that we all seek to replicate if we be to replicate our success in open banking across other part of our economy we need two thing to be true first we must make sure that all data standard apply in other sector be interoperable with the data standard that already exist in open banking the point be that data standard will be different in each sector because each sector datum be hold in different way in different place and by different people under different foundational legal power but they must all converge on set of standard that mean that health datum can safely and securely talk to say energy datum or banking datum follow on from my early intervention when the minister be talk about government new clause if we be to have data standard that allow different bit of datum to be exchange safely and securely it be essential that we do not end up with siloe standard that do not interoperate and that can not talk to each other between the different sector otherwise we will completely fail to leverage our exist lead in open banking and we will effectively have to reinvent the wheel from scratch every time we open up new sector hope that by the time the minister respond to the various point raise in this debate inspiration will have strike and he will be able to confirm that although we might have different data standard it be the government intention that those standard will all be interoperable so that we avoid the problem of balkanisation if can put it that way hope he will be able to provide we with strong reassurance in that direction the second point encapsulate in new clause deal with the follow situation let we suppose that be an app company that be currently successful in open banking have piece of middleware in the open banking ecosystem but fancy be able to take what have do successfully it be world lead in open banking and roll it out to other sector of the economy might want to produce health energy or other app to profit or to provide service from the government plan to roll out smart datum across the rest of the economy therefore need to know which sector be go to be do and in what order otherwise as walk into the office on monday morning need to go up to my development team do not know whether will be tell they to do the energy development the water development or the open smart datum development for online retail first all need therefore be gantt chart or timetable we can call it what we will just need something that tell which sector in what order and by what date so that can make sure that my app be ready on those launch date in order to be able to profit from this so be delighted to see the government autumn statement of week or day ago in paragraph of the green book talk about as those on the labour front bench have mention smart data big bang cover seven sector that be wonderful absolutely super but ask which seven sector and when if the minister be able to clarify that or at the very least say when the government be go to publish the timetable name the sector and the date on which each sector will be ready he will be do international investor in our country and our exist successful world lead organisation agree with the hon gentleman on this but quite lot of step need to be take here for instance we might need to mandate standard on smart meter in order to be able to take advantage of these measure we have not be give any kind of plan so far unless he have see something wish have see something because then would be able to pull my amendment or inform the house have not see something and think such plan be essential not just for member in the chamber this afternoon but for all those investor business leader and app developer that would allow they to work out the critical path whatever the minimum viable product might be and everything else that be go to be necessary and by what date for the sector they be aim for so the hon gentleman be absolutely right in what he say and it be vital that if the minister can not come up with the timetable this afternoon he can at least come up with timetable for the timetable so that we all know when the thing will be available and the rest of the open banking industry can work out how it be go to become an open everything industry and in what order and by what time so this be fairly straightforward there be promising sign both in the autumn statement and in the government new clause but further detail need to be tie down before they can be genuinely useful be assume hop and pray that the minister will be able to provide some of those reassurance and detail when he make his closing remark and will therefore be able to count this as probe amendment and push it no far be devoutly hop that he will be able to make that an easy moment for when he get to his foot apologise to right hon and hon member for any confusion that my movement around the chamber may have create early mr deputy speaker new clause be about the comparability and interoperability of health datum across the uk say to the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant the opposition spokesman that have never be call pregnant before that be new description but will return to his point shortly in these brief remark there be three important reason worth state why datum comparability be important the first be that it empower patient the publication of standardised outcome give patient the ability to make informed choice about their treatment and where they may choose to live secondly it strengthen care through well professional decision making it allow administrator to manage resource and scientist to make interpretation of the datum they receive thirdly comparable datum strengthen devolution administration and policy making in the health sector transparent and comparable datum be essential for that and ensure that we as politician be accountable to voter for the quality of service in our area we could have an academic and philosophical discussion about this but what bring to table new clause be the state of healthcare in north wales we have health board that have be in special measure for the good part of eight year and have to wonder if that would be the case if the scrutiny of it be great one of the intention of devolution be to foster good practice but in order for that to happen we need comparability which have not prove to be the case in the health sector for example nhs scotland do not publish standard referral to treatment time where it do it do not provide average and percentile but rather the proportion of case meet scotland only target in wales rtts be broadly define as the time spend wait between referral for procedure and get that procedure in england only consultant lead pathway be report but in wales some non consultant lead pathway be include such as direct access diagnostic and ally health professional therapy such as physiotherapy and osteopathy which inevitably impact waiting time on cancer waiting time england and scotland have target of test within six week however there be different number of test eight north and south of the border and different measure for when the period end until the last test be complete in england or until the report be write up in scotland those who understand health matter will make well sense of what those difference mean but simply make the observation that there be difference in wales the way we deal with cancer wait time be different wales start its day treatment target from the date the first suspicion be raise by any health provider whereas in england the day target be from the date specialist receive an urgent gp referral furthermore in wales routine referral reprioritise as urgent with suspicion of cancer be consider to be start new clock what can be do about this and why do it require legislation new clause may seem familiar to hon member because it be first bring forward as an amendment to the health and care bill in it be withdraw with the specific intention of give the government the time to develop collaborative framework for share datum with the devolved administration pay tribute to all four government the office for national statistics and official for their work since then notwithstanding that work on september professor ian diamond the uk national statistician make the follow remark to the public administration and constitutional affairs committee about gather comparative health datum across the devolved administration you be entirely right that statistic be devolved responsibility and therefore the datum that be collect for administrative purpose in different part of the united kingdom differ we have find it very difficult recently to collect comparable datum for different administration across the uk on the health service for example on work more closely with the devolved administrations own statistical authority he say we have be work very hard to try to get comparable datum comparable datum be possible in some area but not in other try to get cancer outcome as have just refer to be very difficult because they be collect in different way while statistic be devolve do not have the ability to ensure that all datum be collect in way that be comparable we work really hard to make comparable datum as well as possible but at the moment have to be honest that not all datum can be compare mr deputy speaker new clause be bring forward as constructive proposal believe that it be good for the patient good for the professional who work on their healthcare and good for our own accountability do not think that this house would be divide on ground of compassion or common sense thank all those member who have support my new clause and urge the government to legislate on this matter today be an opportunity for to discuss the issue involve but shall not be move my new clause with the leave of the house call the minister to wind up the debate thank all hon member who have contribute to the debate believe that these matter be important if sometimes very complicated and technical my hon friend the member for yeovil mr fysh be absolutely right to stress how fundamentally important they be and they will become more so also thank the shadow minister for identify the area where we be in agreement we have good committee stage with his colleague the hon member for barnsley east stephanie peacock where we agree on the overall objective of the bill it be welcome that the shadow minister have support we particularly on the amendment that we move this afternoon on the power of the information commissioner office the provision relate to digital verification service and smart datum there be however some area on which we will not agree let begin by address the main amendment that the hon gentleman have move amendment relate to high risk processing it be the case that one of the main aim of the bill be to remove some of the uk gdpr unnecessary compliance burden that be why organisation will be require to designate only senior responsible individual to carry out risk assessment and keep record of processing when their activity pose high risk to individual the amendment that the hon gentleman be propose would reintroduce prescriptive list of high risk processing activity draw from article of the uk gdpr we find that some of the language in article be unclear and confusing which be partly why we remove it in the first place we think organisation should have the ability to make judgment of risk base on the specific nature scale and context of their own processing activity we do not need to provide prescriptive example of high risk processing in the legislation because any list could quickly become out of date instead to help data controller clause of the bill require the ico to produce document with example of what the commissioner consider to be high risk processing but the minister have already indicate that basically he will come forward with exactly the same list as be in the legislation that the government be amend all that be happen be that in the bill the information commissioner will be do what the government or the house could be do and this be the one area where the government disagree with the information commissioner as say the government do not believe that it be necessary to have prescriptive list in the bill we feel that it be well that individual make judgment base on their assessment of the risk with the guidance of the information commissioner move to the shadow minister second amendment the government agree that controller should not be able to refuse request without proper thought or consideration that be why the exist responsibility of controller to facilitate request from datum subject as the default have not change and why the new article also ensure that the burden of proof for request meet the vexatious or excessive threshold remain with the controller the government believe that be sufficient and stipulate that evidence must be provide each time request be refuse may not be appropriate in all circumstance and would likely bring further burden for controller on that basis we oppose that amendment on amendment the safeguard set out in reform article of the uk gdpr ensure that individual be able to seek human intervention when significant decision about they be take solely through automated mean with no meaningful human involvement partly automate decision already involve meaningful human involvement so there be no need to extend the safeguard in article to all form of automate decision making in such instance other datum protection requirement continue to apply and offer relevant protection to data subject as set out in the broad uk datum protection regime those protection include lawfulness fairness transparency and accountability amendment which the hon member for rhondda table along with amendment and give we the opportunity to debate the democratic engagement provision in the bill amendment and would remove clause and which give the secretary of state power to make exception to the privacy and electronic communication regulation direct marketing provision on communication send for the purpose of democratic engagement we have no immediate plan to use the regulation power but it be conceivable that future government might want to treat communication send for the purpose of democratic engagement differently from those for commercial marketing we would lose the option to do that if the regulation make power be remove before lay any regulation under the clause the secretary of state would need to consult the information commissioner and have specific regard to the effect that further exception could have turn to the measure relate to the power of the department for work and pensions raise by the hon member for rhondda the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms who be chair of the work and pensions committee and the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady who speak for the scottish national party we believe that this targeted and limited measure will enable we to identify fraudulent benefit claim and as result will save the taxpayer significant amount of money on the specific point of whether the power should be target on individual benefit rather than more generally should say that at the moment fraud and error in state pension for instance be near zero the government intend to target the benefit power where there be clear evidence of fraudulent activity we be include all benefit to make sure that state pension stay that way my understanding be that the level of fraud among state pension claim be indeed extremely small the minister say early that the government should take power only where they be absolutely necessary think he be now say that they be not necessary in the case of people claim state pension be he confident that that bit of this power to look into the bank account of anybody claim state pension be absolutely necessary what be say be that the government intention be to use the power only when there be clear evidence or suggestion that fraud be take place on significant scale the government simply want to retain the option to amend that should future evidence emerge that be why the issue have be leave open the trouble be that this be not about amend the government describe the relevant benefit in part of propose new schedule within new schedule which be clear that pension be include the minister have effectively say at the dispatch box that the government do not need to tackle fraud in relation to pension perhaps it would be good idea for we to all sit down and have meeting to work out more sensible set of measure to tackle fraud where it be necessary rather than give unending power to the government agree to the extent that level of fraud in state pension be currently nearly zero the power be not need in that case however the government wish to retain an option should the position change in the future but be happy to take the hon gentleman up on his request on behalf of my hon friend the minister for disabled people health and work with whom he have already engage be sure that the right hon member for east ham will want to examine the issue far in the work and pensions committee which he chair it will undoubtedly also be subject to further discussion in the other place we be certainly open to further discussion the right hon member for east ham also raise the question of commencement can tell he that the test and learn phase will begin in with steady roll out to full scale delivery by be sure that he will want to examine these matter far the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden mr davis focus on digital exclusion the bill provide for the use of secure and inclusive digital identity across the economy it do not force business or individual to use they individual choice be integral to our approach as the bill make clear digital verification service can be provide only at the request of the individual where people want to use digital verification service the government be commit to ensure that available product and service be secure and privacy focused that be to be achieve through the high standard set out in the trust framework the trust framework also outline how service can improve inclusion and require service to publish an annual inclusion monitoring report there be business that operate only in the digital sphere such as some online bank and energy company as think have be acknowledge we feel that to oblige they to offer manual document checking would place obligation on business that go beyond the government commitment to do only what be necessary to enable the digital market to grow on amendment from the scottish national party solely automate decision make that produce legal or similarly significant effect on individual be not entirely prohibit previously under the uk datum protection legal framework the rule govern article be confusing and complex so clause clarifie and simplifie the rule relate to solely automate decision making and will reduce barrier to responsible datum use help to drive innovation and maintain high standard of datum protection the reform do not water down any of the protection to data subject offer under the broad uk datum protection regime that is uk gdpr and the data protection act on the other amendment table by the snp amendment effective independent oversight of surveillance camera system be crucial to public trust the oversight framework be complex and confusing for the police and public because of substantial duplication between the surveillance camera commissioner function and the code which cover police and local authority in england and wales only and the ico and datum protection legislation the bill address that follow public consultation through abolish the surveillance camera commissioner and code the amendment table by the hon member for glasgow north would negate that by retain the code and transfer the surveillance camera commissioner function to the investigatory power commissioner it would also blur the line between overt and covert surveillance which the investigatory power commissioner oversee those two type of surveillance have distinct legislation and oversight mainly because covert surveillance be generally consider to be significantly more intrusive on amendment it be important to be clear that the ability to refuse or charge reasonable fee for request already exist and clause do not place new restriction on reasonable request from datum subject the government believe that it be proportionate to allow controller to refuse or charge reasonable fee for vexatious or excessive request and clear provision enable controller to focus time and resource on respond to reasonable request instead amendment and table by my hon friend the member for yeovil would remove the new lawful ground of recognise legitimate interest which the bill will add to article of uk gdpr amendment accept that there be merit in retain the recognise legitimate interest list but would make any addition to it subject to super affirmative parliamentary procedure it be true that the bill remove the need for non public sector organisation to do detailed legitimate interest assessment in relation to small number of processing activity those include activity relate for example to the safeguarding of child crime prevention and respond to emergency we hear from stakeholder that the need to do an assessment and the fear of get it wrong could sometimes delay or deter those important processing activity from take place future government would not be able to add new activity to the list lightly clause of the bill already make it clear that the secretary of state must carefully consider the right and interest of people and in particular the special protection need for child before add anything new to the list any new regulation would also need to be approve via the affirmative resolution procedure my hon friend the member for yeovil have table large number of other amendment which be complicated in nature have write to he in some detail set out the government response to each of those but if he wish to pursue far any of the point contain therein would be very happy to have further discussion with he would like to comment on the amendment by several of my colleague that wish be in position to be able to support in particular my hon friend the member for loughborough jane hunt have be assiduous in pursue her point both in the bill committee and in this debate the problem she identify be without question very real one and she set out in some detail how it be massively increase the burden on the police which clearly we would wish to reduce wherever possible have have meeting with home office ministers as my hon friend have and they absolutely identify that problem and share her wish while we welcome her intent the problem be that we do not think that her amendment as draft would achieve her aim of remove the burden of redaction to do so would require the amendment and exception of more principle than those identify in the amendment indeed it would require the amendment of more law than just the data protection act the government be absolutely committed to reduce the burden on the police but it be obviously important that if we do so we do it right and that the solution work comprehensively we be therefore actively work on way to well address the issue include through improved process new technology guidance and legislation be very happy to continue to work with she on achieve the aim that we all share and so too know be colleague in the home office with respect to the amendment table by my hon friend the member for weston super mare john penrose as indicate we absolutely share his enthusiasm for smart datum and ensure that the power within the bill be implement in timely manner with interoperability at their core while agree that we can only fully realise the benefit of smart datum scheme if they enable interoperability different sector will have different level of exist digital infrastructure and capability thus we could inadvertently hinder the success of future scheme if we mandate the use of one universal set of standard base for instance on those use in open banking the government will ensure that interoperability be central to the development of smart datum scheme to support our thinking we be work with industry and regulator in the smart data council to identify the technical infrastructure that need to be replicate with regard to the timeline or even the timeline for timeline that my hon friend ask for recognise that it be important to build investor industry and consumer confidence by outline the government plan timeline my hon friend be right to highlight the chancellor comment in the autumn statement where we set out plan to kick start the smart datum big bang and our ambition for use those power across seven sector at this stage be afraid be not able to accept his amendment but it be our intention to set out those plan in more detail in the come month know the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake and will be happy to work with he to do so the aim of the amendment table by the hon member for jarrow kate osborne be to clarify that when special category datum of employee such as health datum be transfer between member of group of undertaking for internal administrative purpose on ground of legitimate interest the condition and safeguard outline in schedule of the data protection act should apply to that processing the government agree with the sentiment of her amendment but consider that it be unnecessary the current legal framework already require controller to identify an exemption under article of the uk gdpr if they be process special category datum those exemption be supplement by the condition and safeguard outline in schedule under those provision employer can process special category datum where processing be necessary to comply with obligation under employment law we do not therefore consider the amendment necessary finally turn to new clause table by my hon friend the member for aberconwy robin millar the government be absolutely committed to improve the availability of comparable uk wide datum he too have be assiduous in promote that cause and we be very happy to work with he we be extremely supportive of the principle underlie his amendment he be right to point out that people have the right to know the extent of labour failing with the nhs in wales as he point out and his new clause send an important message on our commitment to well datum can commit to work at pace with he and the uk statistics authority to look at way in which we may be able to implement the intention of his amendment and bring forward legislative change follow those discussion on that basis commend the government amendment to the house question put and agree to new clause accordingly read second time and add to the bill for the benefit of all member we be before the knife so we will have to go through sequence of procedure it would help the clerk and the minister if we have degree of silence this will take little time and we need to be able to concentrate new clause processing of personal datum reveal political opinion schedule to the data protection act special category of personal datum be amend in accordance with subsection to after paragraph insert democratic engagement this condition be meet where the personal datum process be personal datum

not have be possible if britain have still be member of the european union it deliver more flexible and less burdensome data protection regime that maintain high standard of privacy protection while promote growth and boost innovation it do so with the support of the information commissioner and without jeopardise the uk european union datum adequacy would like to thank all member who contribute during the passage of the bill and all those who have help get it right now commend it to the house on its onward passage to the other place call the shadow minister too would like to thank the clerks for their help they be always enormously helpful especially to opposition members and sometimes to government members as well would like to commend my close friend my hon friend the member for barnsley east stephanie peacock who take the bill through committee for our side think the minister suggest that it be rather more fun have she up against he than which be very cruel and unkind of he we support the bill although suspect that regulatory divergence be bit of chimera and that regulatory convergence in this field will give uk business great stability and certainty but that be for another day also worry about the extensive power that minister be give themselves and the suggestion that they will switch off the rule on direct marketing in the run up to general election then there be new schedule repeat the offer have make several time which be that we stand ready to knock that into far well shape whether in meeting we have privately or through our colleague in the house of lords feel ashamed to say it but hope the lords be able to do the line by line scrutiny that we have be prevent from do today call the snp spokesperson the minister say that this bill would not have be possible without brexit think the expression he be look for be that this bill would not have be necessary if it have not be for brexit this be yet another example of the government have to play catch up and have to get themselves out of the hole they dig themselves into through an ill thought out brexit and drive for the hard possible exit from the european union that say do want to echo the thank give and the tribute pay to the bill team and to the clerks who have have to work particularly hard in recent day give the significant number of government amendment table at the last minute also thank my hon friend the member for glasgow north west carol monaghan for her work on second reading and in committee as well as our research team especially josh simmons upton and the many stakeholder who have provide briefing and research particularly the team at the public law project who have do excellent work in draw out some of the most concern aspect of the bill it always concern when the briefing come in entitle plp do doubletake as think be on somebody else mailing list although some of what be in the bill be necessary particularly follow the uk withdrawal from the european union much of it represent further power grab by the executive and risk do exactly the opposite of what the government say they want it to achieve make life easy for business and improve public confidence in datum handling and the use of artificial intelligence the snp will oppose the bill and the government should take the opportunity to start from scratch with process that listen to consultation response and involve genuine and detailed parliamentary scrutiny if the bill proceed to the lords it will once again fall to the unelected house to more fully interrogate it that will no doubt lead to several round of ping pong in due course almost certainly as result of amendment both from the government and from the opposition or cross benchers in the upper house that be sub optimal as be the case with so much of what seem to happen down here these day the soon scotland have power over this area and indeed all aspect of legislation as an independent country the well question put

and hospital in palestine can be rebuild and the process to find last peace with two state solution can begin and the petitioner remain etc refugee family reunion routes sudan motion make and question propose that this house do now mann be grateful to have the opportunity to draw the house attention to the catastrophic situation in sudan and to highlight the circumstance of the people in danger there some of whom have family member recognise as refugee here in the united kingdom hope to take this time to illustrate how the uk family reunion rule make it incredibly difficult for those individual most of they child to join their family member here finally want to ask the government to think again about how they apply the family reunion rule give the horrendous circumstance that those individual face and to urge the minister and his colleague to think about new approach to facilitate and support reunion with family member here rather than hinder it as seem to be the case in too many instance turn first to the circumstance in sudan what be unfold there have be describe by the united nations as one of the bad humanitarian nightmare in recent history since fighting break out between the sudanese armed force and the paramilitary rapid support forces more than have be kill horrific report of rape and sexual violence continue to emerge and clash be increasingly along ethnic line particularly in darfur every hour child be kill injure or abduct many hospital have have to suspend operation other have be bomb or turn into military basis last month the minister for africa say that the violence there bear all the hallmark of ethnic cleansing the fighting that commence in mid april have lead to more than million people flee sudan altogether to neighbour chad egypt ethiopia south sudan and the central african republic meanwhile more than million have be force from their home internally displace within sudan among those displace be almost million refugee and asylum seeker from other country who have already have to flee persecution in their home territory to sudan particularly eritrean national more than million people be on the edge of famine and more than million face acute food insecurity more than million woman and girl face the risk of gender base violence with limited or no access to protection service and support against that background have have the pleasure of work with the refugee and migrant forum of essex and london ramfel which have number of refugee client here in the uk with family member stick in sudan who want to get here altogether ramfel represent individual tiny sample of that country who have be struggle to leave sudan to join their family here seven month on from the start of the most recent conflict only two have make it here so far of those two one child be successful only after an appeal of the who have not yet make it here all be child under ten be eritrean and two be sudanese of those eight be still in sudan itself child in war zone face extreme danger the other four have make it to neighbouring country but as we will see they be not out of danger yet to all reasonable observer give the circumstance of those child reunion with their family member in the united kingdom must be appropriate and the right thing to do be it not precisely for such situation that we have family reunion policy at all family reunion would provide safe legal route to the uk allow both the individual here and those come here to get on with rebuild their life it would remove any temptation to seek assistance from people smuggler break the business model to borrow that expression most fundamentally those child would be safe commend the hon member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east stuart mcdonald on secure this debate that constituency be quite mouthful and hope pronounce it right he be at the fore in address this issue in sudan million people have be displace and million be live in five neighbouring country the british red cross have be instrumental in reunite more than displace people and their family it can offer support with visa application if the individual be base in london liverpool preston or plymouth accord to its website do he agree that it be important to have visa assistance hub throughout the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland with at least one for the devolved institution in northern ireland the hon gentleman make perfect sense organisation such as the red cross and ramfel which have be work with on this topic be fantastic the more support we can give they and people across the united kingdom the well these be precisely the circumstance in which we should have refugee family reunion rule regret to report that unfortunately the rule and process be make it hard for these people than it should be in particular while uk rule be pretty generous for spouse partner and child acknowledge that they be more restrictive for other category of relative include sibling most of the child be talk about today have lose their parent and it be an old sibling here in the uk that they be seek to join furthermore the rule require enrolment of biometric information before an application will even be look at that mean the child can not even get over the starting line because the visa application centre in sudan understandably have to close after the outbreak of the conflict if there be no way to safely provide biometric information surely we should stop ask for it in advance will set out precisely how the application of the family reunion rule and procedure have impact on the child be use pseudonym to protect the identity of individual sixteen year old adila flee to sudan to escape persecution in eritrea include force conscription into the army as lone year old girl in war zone she clearly face significant risk she have already be displace from khartoum to city in eastern sudan and be struggle severely with her mental health she seek family reunion with her old brother who be recognise refugee here in the uk however hers be one of number of case that can not get off the ground because the home office insist she attend visa application centre to enrol biometric information the centre in sudan be close so that would mean have to make an irregular and dangerous journey to neighbouring country to do it there acknowledge that the home office do consider application to defer enrolment of biometric information until the person either arrive at or be at least en route to the uk so that the application can proceed but even cursory look at the relevant policy document show that it be only in very few circumstance indeed where the home office allow that to happen when year old adila ask to defer enrolment she be refuse that application the home office say she have not prove her identity with reasonable certainty and assert that have cross one border irregularly flee eritrea to get to sudan she could obviously manage to do so again do not believe that that be fair approach to take to year old girl in sudan allowance have to be make for the fact that eritrean refugee in sudan will almost certainly not be able to produce passport degree of latitude be therefore require the idea that because someone flee over border in fear of persecution they can just be call on to make another dangerous and irregular journey be in itself dangerous idea it rid coach and horse through the home office own policy it would not be worth the paper it be write on if an unaccompanied year old girl in war zone can not avail herself of the deferral policy who on earth can seven of the other individual be in similar situation they can not apply because they be in sudan and there be no place to go to enrol their biometric information even among those who have make it out of sudan similar issue can arise for example fatima year old eritrean girl have originally make family application to join her brother in the uk just prior to the outbreak of the war in sudan she have get as far as book an appointment at the visa application centre in khartoum that of course have to be cancel when the centre close after the outbreak of fighting fatima end up trafficked from khartoum to south sudan some week after the outbreak of war and be release only on the payment of ransom she clearly remain at severe risk of kidnapping sexual exploitation and all other manner of harm there be no visa application centre in south sudan but again the home office refuse to defer biometric enrolment ramfel ask the home office if as an alternative mobile biometric enrolment could take place someone would travel to south sudan from regional vac to take the biometric there if require ramfel would offer to pay but even that reasonable offer be refuse ask the question again if those circumstance do not merit the deferral of biometric enrolment or other compromise action what on earth do be that not the problem with the hostile environment there be no circumstance they do not want people to come it do not matter how dreadful the circumstance be that people be live in it do not matter that this be the country where they have family member who can make they feel at home and welcome and help they to start to overcome the trauma they have go through the home office do not want to know computer say no the door be close computer say no be pretty close to the bone the home office have policy on biometric enrolment and it stick rigidly to it even when dramatic circumstance such as those persist in sudan mean that different approach should be take the home office can take different approach and it have do so in certain circumstance the minister would not like it if make comparison with ukraine and do not want to do so but simply point out that in those incredible circumstance the home office be able to take different approach be not ask for anything remotely approach what be do in that situation be just ask the home office to be little more deft wee bit more responsive and to think about the consideration that should apply for people apply from sudan be sure my hon friend be aware that there be big sudanese community in glasgow and remember meeting have with number of sudanese people who make that very point about ukraine they say we want this country to look after ukrainians of course it have to look after they they be go through terrible war and they be be attack but so be our family what be the difference do my hon friend understand how important this debate will be to sudanese people live in this country at last somebody be talk about their pain and care enough to secure debate in the house of commons know they really appreciate everything he be try to do be grateful to my hon friend for her remark but the tribute should be pay to ramfel and the other organisation out there that do amazing work on behalf of the sudanese community there be people who would make legitimate argument that there should be some sort of equivalence in the treatment of ukraine and sudan but that be not the case be make tonight be simply say that the home office show in the case of ukraine that it be willing to apply different rule or to apply the same rule differently it be able to be nimble and to respond accordingly to grave situation this too be grave situation and there should be some sort of flexibility in the response on this point the solution be pretty obvious we need more generous set of exception to the rule that require biometric information be provide in advance be not the only one say that the house of lords justice and home affairs committee recently report on family migration the home office should exercise its discretion to lift or delay the requirement to submit biometric when this would involve travel in dangerous condition or outside the applicant country of residence the home office should allow biometric to be complete on arrival in the uk for wide range of nationality in crisis situation that seem to be the compassionate and common sense thing to do if the minister be not willing to go as far as the committee suggest surely he must see that the application of the rule in the type of circumstance have describe be gravely unsettling and must be revisit in some form turn next to rule in relation to sibling even those who ultimately be able to jump through the first administrative hoop be far from guarantee success in their family reunion application exist rule focus on family reunion for spouse and for child under have speak in previous debate about various problem with what regard as the overly restrictive category of relationship that can benefit from family reunion without further test apply but today will focus on sibling give the situation prevail in sudan and neighbouring country many child find themselves either orphan or without any contact with their parent for these kid their sibling here in the uk be essentially their only remain family that say if year old seek to join their year old brother here they must first pay fee and health surcharge unless they be grant waiver which add an additional hurdle then as well as prove their relationship they must show that there be exceptional circumstance and that the refusal of their application would result in unjustifiably harsh consequence for the applicant meet those test can be surprisingly difficult it often seem that the general country situation however hellish will never be enough to make person circumstance even child circumstance exceptional enough to overcome that hurdle person seem to need to be able to show that their circumstance be exceptional even compare with other individual in that country in that warzone that be hugely difficult prospect likely require legal advice and lawyer and it be difficult to obtain the necessary evidence surely the home office can be more responsive to the situation on the ground in sudan at the very least could we not have clear guidance that any child live unaccompanie in sudan should be treat as meet the necessary test of exceptionality and harsh consequence and therefore should in principle be allow to be reunite with uk base sibling surely that be the bare minimum we can do as say even if those test be overcome the fact that sibling be not consider core family member for the purpose of the rule have other consequence turn to another case study two unaccompanied eritrean child see household member kill one of the kid be beat up during the same raid they submit application for family reunion in november some month before the most recent upsurge in fighting the application be originally refuse but an appeal be lodge and the home office eventually concede it that be welcome but the home office be now insist on payment of the immigration health surcharge which of course the family simply can not afford surely in such circumstance any fee or health surcharge should be waive finally turn to processing time if one of these kid be somehow in position to jump through all the hoop have describe surely the least we will offer be speedy priority service the service standard for family reunion application be week but be tell that many application take six month to year if an appeal be require in order to overturn refusal we have just hear about an example of that the wait can be more than double family separation will always be painful but for unaccompanied child in sudan and even in some of the neighbouring country it be also seriously dangerous surely some sort of priority processing have to be give to case where the applicant be directly in danger another case study involve wissam who be and abdul who be they apply to join their old brother just before war break out and have an appointment to enrol their biometric in khartoum that could not happen as the centre close down struggle to access food and water and at risk of kidnapping trafficking or exploitation the brother be victim of robbery ultimately they decide to flee again and make dangerous irregular journey to uganda they now live unaccompanie in cramp condition and because of their age and nationality face regular discrimination in access sanitation include clean water the year old be struggle with mental health issue and suffering night terror because of his experience in sudan and on the journey to uganda surely we can not leave those two brother who be now in position to submit their application to wait for month and perhaps year surely application have to be give priority in those circumstance the minister will no doubt tell we about the significant number of people who do arrive here in the uk under our family reunion arrangement acknowledge that fact and welcome it however it would be totally wrong to say that the system be function well various report by the independent chief inspector of border and immigration testify to that lot of improvement still have to be make be not ask for revolution today although perhaps will pursue that far in the month to come today simply ask that the home office accept that it have to be nimble to respond and to tweak its rule and process where circumstance require the utterly dire circumstance in sudan surely justify such response in summary be ask the home office three thing first ask it to rethink the requirement for people trap in sudan particularly child to provide biometric in advance at visa application centre please look at alternative whether wait until people arrival in the uk before require biometric or some other compromise that do not hold up the consideration of application secondly ask the home office either by tweak the rule or perhaps more realistically by issue guidance for case such as those have describe to make it clear that as general rule child from sudan seek to join sibling or other family member in the uk should be treat as meet the exceptional test for the family reunion rule would like to think that that would be apply to sibling more generally but for today purpose make special case for those seek to leave sudan also ask the home office not to make any such application subject to fee and health surcharge thirdly ask the home office to prioritise these application in recognition of the danger that the people make they face do not leave they wait for month finally if possible seek to work with international organisation and non governmental organisation to help support safe passage from sudan as and when application be allow close with warning because the danger be that if we do not facilitate their application these youngster will end up seek to make their own way to the uk irregularly and dangerously that bring to the final case want to mention which be that of year old daoud who flee eritrea to sudan in the light of the situation there he flee again to south sudan with no progress on secure refugee family reunion from there he take matter into his own hand and start make his way towards the mediterranean he be currently arbitrarily detain in libya some might say he make his own choice but think we leave he with no choice at all do not want to have to come back here in few month with another adjournment debate on this subject and to have to provide similar or even bad update on the other child have mention in this debate know the minister can not make policy on the hoof but urge he to speak with official to rethink the home office strategy in relation to those who be suffer in sudan and to ensure that we be do all we can to facilitate and support family reunion thank the hon member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east stuart mcdonald for secure this adjournment debate we share his deep concern about the situation in sudan and all those affect by it include those seek refugee status in the united kingdom or other safe country the government remain committed to uphold the principle of family reunion by provide safe and legal route to bring family together through the refugee family reunion policy the family reunion route allow individual with protection status in the uk to sponsor their partner or child to stay with or join they here provide they form part of family unit before the sponsor flee their country of origin to seek protection while we sympathise greatly with the situation in which many individual in sudan find themselves we do not intend to prioritise refugee family reunion application from those impact by the sudanese conflict as there be many other individual in the queue who will be face broadly comparable situation elsewhere in the world we want to treat all individual face such situation in the same manner and ensure that where appropriate they can be support to life in the uk in accordance with our rule would not necessarily say that people seek to come here from sudan because they be in danger there should be prioritise ahead of other who face similar risk elsewhere point that the minister fairly make but do the home office make any consideration or assessment of risk at all there be people who apply for refugee family reunion quite rightly and fairly who do not face any imminent risk because they be in relatively safe third country surely the fact that people be face real danger be an add reason to give priority to their family reunion application that should be something that the department consider the hon gentleman make valid point which be happy to take up with my official our policy be one of non discrimination so individual be treat equally regardless of their country of origin obviously there be number of place in the world with great danger and we do not choose to rank they in order of priority however can see some merit in what he be say so be happy to give that consideration it be important to note that the uk have very strong record of support refugee since we have resettle over half million people seek safety which be among the most generous offering in our country history the uk rank highly among other develop country in that regard we continue to welcome refugee through our exist global resettlement scheme include the uk resettlement scheme itself community sponsorship and the mandate resettlement scheme since we have issue family reunion visa to family member of those with protection status with over half of those visa for child that figure demonstrate our commitment to refugee family reunion we have welcome sudanese national through both our uk resettlement scheme and the community sponsorship scheme in and between and sudanese national have be grant visa under refugee family reunion in the year to september sudanese national be grant visa under refugee family reunion the uk be make significant commitment although of course the need be very great as the hon gentleman say due to the situation in sudan we will continue to consider our approach to refugee family reunion in the round rather than on crisis by crisis basis the uk have no plan at the moment to introduce designate resettlement scheme for sudanese refugee as general rule it be important that the uk do not treat migration as the first lever that we pull to try to help people in grave situation in the world generally speak the great impact that the uk can make whether that be in sudan or in other crisis situation be by use our full diplomatic muscle and our development aid to support people in the region which be in fact the place where the majority of refugee find themselves indeed that happen with respect to the sudanese situation where hundred of thousand of individual be be support by the united nations high commissioner for refugees and other organisation in the immediate environ of sudan the uk be proud to be support those effort to help those individual wish to turn more specifically to some of the very valid question that the hon gentleman raise first he raise the question of those flee conflict zone who find it difficult to provide document for family reunion purpose we recognise that this be challenge for those flee their home and their home country although the onus be on the applicant to show that the relationship be genuine there be no specific requirement to provide certain type of evidence we recognise that documentary evidence may not always be available particularly in country where there be no function administrative authority to issue passport marriage certificate or birth certificate decision maker should take into consideration evidence from range of source include information provide by their uk family sponsor each decision be consider on the balance of probability to identify whether there be sufficient evidence to prove that the individual be relate as claim it be important to prevent abuse of the refugee family reunion policy and to safeguard applicant by carefully review their application where fraudulent document be submit or where there be evidence that the sponsor obtain leave by deception with more specific regard to the situation in sudan the hon gentleman be right to say that the visa application centre in khartoum be close until further notice as result any passport remain there be have to be hold in secure storage we be committed to do everything we can to support people who find themselves affect by that closure and to reopen the centre as soon as it be safe to do so for our staff and their contractor there be other visa application centre in the wide vicinity of sudan appreciate that the distance be long and that the journey can be arduous and at time unsafe we do have visa centre in cairo and jeddah and many people have make use of those in the time since the crisis begin even among the case that speak about one or two individual have make it into neighbouring country unfortunately one have make it to south sudan where there be also not visa application centre but surely particularly in the case of child it be too much to ask they to make dangerous journey such as that to supply biometric information there should be some sort of presumption against the need to provide biometric information or at least willingness to consider defer it before the home office even look at the application in most case unfortunately individual will have to make journey to leave sudan as it be very unlikely that they will fly directly from sudan most of the case that have be make aware of as immigration minister be of individual who have make the journey to cairo or to jeddah or other neighbouring country rise before give way to the hon gentleman will reply directly on the biometric point which be an important question fundamentally we believe that biometric be extremely important because we want to protect the uk national security and the safety of our citizen here although of course we all want to see the good in individual come here particularly in young people and child there be individual whom we would not want to enter the united kingdom as such biometric in the form of facial image and fingerprint underpin our immigration system however we make exception for individual who find themselves in the most difficult situation we publish guidance in may which set out our approach to handle applicant who claim that it be unsafe to travel from sudan to visa application centre in another country to enrol their biometric he refer to that situation in his speech the guidance set out the circumstance under which uk visas and immigration will either predetermine an application or defer the requirement to enrol biometric information until the applicant arrive in the uk when the applicant have demonstrate their circumstance to be exceptional in most case we require biometric to be take as part of the application so that we can conduct the check on person identity and suitability to come to the uk it be ultimately the responsibility of the applicant to satisfy the decision maker about their identity hope that the hon gentleman can take some comfort from the fact that the guidance give that flexibility hear that he feel that it be be apply too onerously and in way that be insufficiently sensitive to the situation in sudan be happy to take that away speak to my official and if he have further example to put those in front of they so that we can make sure that the guidance be be apply fairly be grateful that the minister be open to have discussion about this issue he be right that ultimately all these kid will probably have to leave for neighbouring country for onward travel however it be one thing to ask they to leave in the certainty that they will be allow into the united kingdom it be another to ask they to leave and provide biometric information on the off chance that they might be allow in at some future point one compromise might be to consider the family reunion application without the biometric information if it be grant then tell they to come to neighbouring country and provide the biometric information there will the minister take that away and think about it will be happy to look into that and come back to the hon gentleman we both agree that biometric be important we want to ensure that they be compromise only in the most exceptional circumstance so that we can protect national security but it be important that we show degree of discretion when people young people in particular find themselves in the hard of situation will be happy to look into the issue and write to he the hon gentleman also mention processing time for family reunion application and want to address that directly in general ukvi be operate well and be meet its service standard in all or almost all visa category but there be delay with respect to family reunion point that he and other member have raise in the past we acknowledge the need to dedicate more resource to support the safe and legal route and be review process to streamline decision making to make it more efficient for applicant we recognise that the family member of those with protection status in the uk be particularly vulnerable when the out of country decision make team receive request for prioritisation from an applicant or their representative that will be assess to determine whether the application should be prioritise as say in answer to the hon gentleman previous comment we do not prioritise in blanket way because of nationality but we do give priority to case involve particularly vulnerable individual example of ground for prioritisation may include applicant or sponsor who have serious medical condition or terminal illness the list of ground for prioritisation be non exhaustive manager undertake holistic consideration of the applicant circumstance when consider request for prioritisation the hon gentleman also ask about the cost of refugee family reunion it be free no fee it levy although he do raise some of the ally cost that go with it we make sure that the route be free for obvious reason the hon gentleman also ask about child sponsor the family reunion policy be intend to allow those grant protection status in the uk to sponsor pre flight immediate family member to join they here we must avoid create an incentive for people particularly child to leave their family and risk very dangerous journey hop that relative will be able to join they later we do unfortunately come across example of that include through the small boat route which be among the most perilous of journey that child could make there be other provision in the immigration rule that cater for extended family member and where valid application do not meet the criterion within our rule include child sponsor we consider whether there be compelling compassionate factor that warrant granting outside the rule we believe that be child allow to sponsor parent that would create real risk of an incentive for more child to be encourage or even force to leave their family and risk very hazardous journey to the uk that play into the hand of criminal gang that exploit vulnerable people and go against all our safeguard responsibility and instinct our policy be not design to keep child refugee apart from their parent but in consider any policy we have to think carefully about the wide impact to avoid put more people unnecessarily into harm way finally will answer the broad question about refugee resettlement we have proud record as country have offer half million people safe and legal route into the uk we understand that the scale of disruption and situation around the world mean that so many people find themselves in grave need our approach have to be consider very carefully but we want to continue to work with international organisation such as the one that the hon member reference we have good relationship with the united nations high commissioner for refugees through our global resettlement scheme and early in the year through the illegal migration act we legislate so that we can introduce further scheme in the future recently launch consultation in which we ask every local authority in the whole of the united kingdom to give we their capacity to take refugee on such scheme over the course of the year to come that consultation be open and encourage the hon member to talk to his local authority and see whether it be take part in it we will carefully consider the response and if they suggest that there be further capacity across the uk that will lead we either to extend exist scheme or to create new one so that the uk can play an even great and more generous role in the year ahead in help more people from place such as sudan to come to the uk thank the hon member for secure the debate and all our colleague tonight who have listen or contribute fully understand the interest in the subject give the great concern that everyone feel about the situation in sudan hope that have set out our record and the work that we be do and give he some assurance that he and can work closely together to learn from his experience and his evident sincere concern about the issue to ensure that the scheme be operate as well as it can question put and agree to house adjourn deferred division strikes minimum service levels that the draft strikes minimum service levels nhs ambulance services and the nhs
