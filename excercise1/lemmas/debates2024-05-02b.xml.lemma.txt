on the order paper relate to trade envoy may say how proud we be of the cross party trade envoy programme which think he will hear about in moment we think they do an excellent good value for money job for the united kingdom in promote trade in number of key market parliamentary trade envoys what the travel cost of parliamentary trade envoy be in each of the last three year the prime minister trade envoy provide invaluable support in progress the uk trade and investment agenda in market across the world the travel cost incur by the prime minister trade envoy be for the financial year for and for these cost be for flight for accommodation when the official british residence be unavailable and for other sundry expense there be great deal of murkiness about the trade envoy note that in answer to my hon friend the member for cardiff west kevin brennan the minister point blank refuse to deny that at least one trade envoy have explicitly ask for the exclusive use of house while act as trade envoy the minister have point blank refuse to publish the breakdown of all the trade envoy and their cost for absolutely spurious reason if select committee visit south korea for instance all the detail of the cost be publish but not if trade envoy go how can we possibly judge whether the that have be spend so far in the past three year have be well spend be there any accountability

company brilliant scottish business have just receive an award in this year make in the uk sell to the world award the value of scotland oil export to the eu reach billion in with total oil export up so the value of oil as an export commodity can not be overstate those billion of pound in export can be balance against the modest million investment that would increase grangemouth profitability threefold secure its long term future and save grangemouth from closure do the secretary of state accept that it would be absurd for scotland to be the only major oil produce nation without refinery capacity and will she agree to meet to discuss this matter far give that the scottish government be otherwise occupy the hon gentleman be right to raise this issue it be something that we be concern

do the minister recognise that cbam work only if they be comprehensive across all country and sector and if we start give exemption here or there the entire policy will unravel that be particularly important give that tata plan for port talbot be base on import million of tonne of semi finished product steel from india country that produce its steel with significantly high carbon intensity will

the fourth large exporter overall and the large net exporter of financial and insurance service in the world trade barrier have lead to billion uplift for uk business in the last five year and since uk manufacturing growth have be high than that of any other nation we be on the right path and we have to stick to it do not want to give labour the chance to unpick all that we have do from brexit to trade union reform the hon gentleman ask about general election and whether something be go to crop up think that something be go to crop up whether it be pension the nhs rail tax or welfare the labour party claim that it be go to do one thing but be plan another and think that the public will see through that it be the most audacious deception since the big bad wolf don winceyette nightie and ask little red riding hood to admire his upper denture but unlike red riding hood the british people have meet this wolf before and they remember that the story do not end well the british people remember how disastrously labour run our train and we have read this week that to improve efficiency labour plan to run few train they remember mrsa infect hospital and they be now see the unforgivable state of the nhs in wales as it struggle with reduced budget labour be responsible for that as it be labour that cut the nhs budget they remember labour council tax hike for pensioner and other on fix income which constitute the large increase in their outgoing in government labour double council tax and in wales it have triple it the british public will look at the council league table out today and notice that the bad service be provide by labour council those charge the high taxis be labour local authority and the area with the bad crime rate be labour control and where do we see the low employment rate the small pay packet and the bad nhs waiting list in the whole uk in labour run wales always every single time labour be in office every single time the british people give labour chance they find themselves bad off poor and less safe badly serve and with more unemployment and they see that the nation be weak at least those in the labour party be consistent so say to the british people do give they the chance to do it again further business will be announce in the usual way call the father of the house the question of local council election have be raise those who want some amusement can read acts quote in today times and provide by the bible society although be not suggest that my right hon friend should read it now walk here today through victoria tower

day motion do not expect my right hon friend to respond to this today that this house note the first special report of the holocaust memorial bill select committee on the problem with the current

memorial and believe these need update attention on deliverability from the infrastructure commission from the national audit office on likely capital cost and recurrent annual cost from the chancellor on future funding control and from the police and security service on maintain unfettered public access for use of victoria tower gardens while protect the memorial ask his majesty government and the holocaust memorial foundation agency to commission the view of the property consultant on comparison of the current proposal by sir david adjaye in victoria tower gardens with viable alternative to commission the full appraisal and to hold public consultation on the selection of site and far ask his majesty government to commit to have this or an amend proposal consider first by the local planning authority before consider whether to call in the application note that an open minded observer could doubt another minister in the levelling up department should be ask to make an independent decision on an application by the secretary of state as the committee have clearly indicate before the government think of bring the bill back to the chamber of the house of commons they need to do number of thing first they must review security we have see the holocaust memorial in hyde park cover up because of march go on around london and everyone know that memorial in victoria tower gardens of the kind that be propose would be major target the only way of provide security be to exclude the public from this park which be the only park for local resident secondly the national infrastructure commission have say that this project be undeliverable will the government please ask the member of the commission whether they have change their mind last year the national audit office report that the cost have rise in one year from million to million will the government please ask its member whether that can be review how will the chancellor agree to pay run cost of between million and million think that the government ought to delay do what be suggest in my early day motion and then report back to the house it might be more helpful if the father of the house

medium sized enterprise particularly our farmer and fisher do the government care for the third time ask the leader of the house for an urgent debate specifically on the tory trade tax so that someone

one side for once and have debate in government time on the unbelievable mess at sevington and its impact on the wide supply chain or will she too just ignore this crisis of her own government making

opposition day to the completion of any such work as to do so would be profoundly unfair on opposition party will the leader of the house confirm that she be not hold opposition day hostage can confirm that and hope to be able to schedule some more opposition day debate soon but we want some assurance about the process that will govern they know that everyone agree that it be incredibly important the right of minority party be protect in this place that be the point of those debate and we should have confidence in they in the future can we have debate on antisemitism at uk university

on the hour long journey away from our city and to ensure that the home office update the mp and answer their question in relation to that detention the hon lady will know that the home office will always talk to member of this house about constituency case of whatever nature but it be clear that give our finite resource we can honour our obligation to those seek asylum here only if our asylum system can deal with the volume of people come in we should use those finite resource in way that help people but we can also choose which individual we want to help and ensure that people who do not have leave to remain in this country do not remain here that be what this democratic parliament have decide to do because the british people wish we to do it she ought to reflect on that there be number of body that the public rely on to be impartial and to protect the public interest include the general medical council the solicitors regulation authority and the civil aviation authority to name but three when independent regulator take money from the world economic forum or other vested interest they lose their independence so can we have statement from the relevant minister on how we be go to end regulatory capture something we have see at the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency with disastrous consequence can that minister also explain why the guidance to so call independent regulator say that it regard their regulation as tool of government regulator have very clear responsibility that be well understand member of this house will work with they on whole raft of issue to raise concern about the sector they cover and how they be operate in their local area if the hon gentleman have any specific charge of regulator not do its job as he know the department

one thing that cause problem for music festival across this island be the brexit obstruction that prevent many musician from come from the eu to perform in scotland and scottish and english musician from perform in the eu do she agree that we should have debate in government time about how we can well reconcile that situation with the brexit reality that we find ourselves in the hon gentleman

backbench business security in the western balkans beg to move that this house recognise the acute security situation in the western balkans support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina condemn the attack by serb nationalist militant in banjska kosovo on september far support the authority of the constitutional court in bosnia and herzegovina far condemn russian interference in the balkans note with concern pro russian and pro serbian irredentist political rhetoric in montenegro and urge the government to increase its engagement with regional partner and international ally to improve the security landscape of the western balkans pivotal moment for the western balkans approach moment that will decide whether the dream of democratic peaceful euro atlantic integrate balkans can be realise or whether we will return to the nightmare of the without peace there can be no progress and with the threat of violence and the embrace of hatred insecurity be breed today hope to set out some step that the government can take to protect peace and as we all hope to protect we from have to confront the dreadful alternative of conflict thank the backbench business committee for agree to this debate which be very much appreciated and welcome the ambassador of bosnia and herzegovina and of kosovo to the chamber want to start by discuss bosnia and herzegovina which with its multi ethnic character and constitution act as linchpin for the wide region next year we mark the anniversary of the dayton agreement which bring an end to the horror of the bosnian war before the war of people in sarajevo be married to spouse of different ethnicity with child who study and play together and neighbour who cook together but they suddenly find themselves separate by conflict unable to understand why their world have fall apart and why those they have call friend shun and abandon they the tragedy of the bosnian war be embody in the story of the year old boško brkić and admira ismić know as the romeo and juliet of sarajevo boško be bosnian serb who be deeply in love with his girlfriend admira bosniak both be trap in the siege of sarajevo by the bosnian serb army and attempt to escape in hop to continue their young life full of hope and away from the horror of war as they attempt to leave the city boško be shoot by sniper and kill instantly another shot injure admira who in her last moment crawl to boško and embrace his body eventually succumb to her wound while she hug her beloved their final embrace as admira lie die signal the unwavering strength of their bond and represent the rejection of hatred and of ethnic division the hope of the young romeo and juliet of sarajevo continue to be hold by many people across bosnia and herzegovina and it be our duty to empower they to dream of that bright future and to do all we can to limit the return of violence and more cruelty on the street thank my hon friend for secure this debate at crucial time do not think it an exaggeration to say that the current situation be tinderbox and on knife edge to mix metaphor the story she have just relay be important do she agree that it illustrate that the nationalistic leadership who want to stir up hatred be in such minority because the vast majority of the population of bosnia and herzegovina be unaware of their ethnic background they see themselves as bosnians and that be exploit by those nationalist tendency my right hon friend unsurprisingly be absolutely right that be why it be so important at this time when we see the risk of return to the tinderbox that we in this place attempt to safeguard the truth we must never forget the horror of the bosnian war or the siege of sarajevo which be still the long in modern history and where almost civilian be kill neither should we forget the genocide of srebrenica where man and boy be murder or the people dead and the million displace sadly those who seek to break up bosnia today use the past as weapon invert it to retraumatise victim and glorify atrocity milorad dodik the so call president of republika srpska have consistently deny the srebrenica genocide despite bosnia wide law ban genocide denial as we know denial be continuation of genocide group of country include bosnia germany and rwanda be bring resolution to the un general assembly formally to recognise july as the international memorial day for the victim of the srebrenica genocide the resolution be support by balkan country include croatia montenegro albania north macedonia and slovenia yet serbia oppose it enshrine remembrance of the srebrenica genocide and other victim of the bosnian war in international law send strong message that the international community reject historical revisionism and the weaponisation of the past it also prevent the revictimisation of survivor and send strong message to milorad dodik and all those who seek return to the that we have not forget and we will not forget be grateful that the foreign secretary have make it clear that the uk will both vote for and promote the resolution some however be seek to misrepresent that resolution what it do not do be pass collective judgment against the people of serbia it be about individual responsibility and end the denial of genocide to build well future with common language denial prevent community from come together and build new future and the memory of past trauma steel we in our mission to safeguard modern day bosnia and herzegovina the dayton agreement to which the uk be signatory establish the office of high representative and the constitutional court of bosnia to ensure the state viability and development milorad dodik have seek to violate the treaty pass illegal law in republika srpska to reject the authority of both those entity he be now before court on charge relate to those violation and if find guilty will be ban from hold office and face up to five year in prison predictably rather than face up to the consequence of his action dodik have threaten bosnia and herzegovina state that republika srpska will secede from bosnia if he be convict republika srpska be not dodik dodik be not republika srpska and he be wrong when he endanger all those who live within its environ that cowardly attempt to shield himself behind state institution will have dire consequence for all bosnian and the uk must be unequivocal in our support for the constitutional court and its judgment russia have clear interest in foment conflict in the balkans to distract from its renew illegal invasion of ukraine sadly it hold veto over the security framework of bosnia and herzegovina and the renewal of eufor that consequently hand it veto over the entire region which be akin some might say to hand match to an arsonist eventually you will be force to put out the fire just to illustrate where we be with russia dodik give the high order of republika srpska to putin dodik absolutely do do that once again my right hon friend be absolutely right over the next few day there will be great easter come together of dodik vučić and other around greater serbia which will touch on briefly ask the government to work with our ally to consider an alternative peacekeeping framework to eufor lead by nato the dayton agreement give nato explicit permission to legally establish force in bosnia for peacekeeping without time limit or un approval there be widespread support from the bosnian government and its legality under the dayton agreement mean that neither dodik nor putin could block it unlike the current arrangement with eufor as minimum the uk should send nato peacekeeping force to the strategic brčko district which be sure my right hon and gallant friend the member for beckenham bob stewart will speak about shortly even one battalion of nato troop in brčko would make secession militarily impossible and have stabilise effect on all of bosnia politic entirely endorse that point british battalion position in bosnia would give very strong signal frankly british battalion be probably the good battalion to send into such peacekeeping situation my right hon and gallant friend be absolutely right to that point know that the foreign secretary in answer question from member in the other place yesterday say that he would prefer to emphasise and focus on kosovo but we see that when british troop go into kosovo last september there be resurgence in the delivery of the mandate my right hon and gallant friend be right that british troop would make fundamental difference the fact that the dayton agreement give we explicit permission to create new security force mean that we should actively be debate it finally the uk should look at extend the sanction levy against dodik and other senior figure in his circle which be relieve to secure few year ago the joint sanction with the uk and the us have begin to take serious effect with bosnian bank close the account of those target urge the government to consider sanction other figure from republika srpska who support law design to undermine the high representative and the constitutional court promote genocide denial and glorification and attempt to transfer bosnian state asset to their personal control bosnia with its multi ethnic character and constitution be barometer for the entirety of the western balkans when threaten the break up of bosnia dodik say if anybody try to stop we we have friend who will defend we say let we show he that bosnia too have friend and none more steadfast than the united kingdom now be the time for deterrence diplomacy and rejuvenate nato to take the initiative and ensure that bosnia sovereignty and security be protect while the situation in bosnia be tense kosovo be the only country in the western balkans to have face an attack on its soil since our last debate on the western balkans the banjska attack carry out last september see heavily armed serb militant murder kosovan police officer afrim bunjaku before engage in firefight from the banjska monastery the amount of weaponry seize from the militant be truly extraordinary have see it myself and refer to my declaration in the register of members financial interests thank the hon member for secure today important debate on security in the western balkans on recent visit to serbia as part of cross party parliamentary delegation witness the immense potential as well as the stark challenge in the region do she agree that the uk government must do their level well to help to defuse tension between serbia and kosovo to ensure that the right of minority on both side of the border be protect and crucially to promote democracy by do their level well to reduce russian influence in the region and in serbia without question everyone must help to defuse the situation and everyone must support ethnic minority and we should be clear that we in this place as will say later in my speech want to be friend to democratic serbia that be what we all aspire to in the region to go back to the banjska attack the arsenal of those militant include anti tank rocket launcher automatic rifle two automatic grenade launcher four mortar two armoured vehicle and more than kg of explosive the weapon serial number line up those be not miscellaneous item nor be they old or expired stock some be just couple of year old be sure the minister will agree that such level of weaponry be not typical for provincial militia it therefore beg the question who be support the banjska attacker and why the answer may lie in some of the footage recover from those who undertake the attack which show the militant train in serbian military base on september just four day before the attack likewise some of those aforementioned serial number on the weaponry match up to the maintenance document record the same weapon as belong to the serbian military countless time in the house in writing and in private meeting have ask the government to release an assessment of whether the serbian state provide material and strategic support for the banjska attack the us have complete report on who be responsible and their link to the serbian government our ally need to release that urgently because truth matter and accountability matter without that report the truth be deny and there be no deterrence because impunity breed contempt for the rule of law and order swift and equitable accountability for act of aggression be crucial if we want to discourage future violence and dispel any notion of appeasement so ask again who organise the banjska attack who provide the weaponry and what do we assess be their intent would be grateful if the minister answer that when he respond what we do know beyond doubt be that the attack be lead by milan radoičić former vice president of the srpska lista party the current wave of tension in northern kosovo explode when srpska lista orchestrate an electoral boycott of municipal election last may without the participation of kosovan serbs the election return albanian mayor the installation of the mayor by the kosovan government spark unrest we have all speak about how risky that be include directly to the government however we then see violent attack on kosovo force kfor by serbian militia that injure italian and hungarian troop some of whom will never walk again at the time the uk the us and the eu condemn kosovo for instal the democratically elect mayor but do not criticise serbia for its support of the boycott and srpska lista write joint statement sign by parliamentarian from europe include almost every chair of foreign affairs committee in europe the us and canada ask for fairer approach to the crisis and for kosovo not to be single out the statement and multiple vote and debate in the eu parliament have show that the international community want to see more even handed approach to kosovo and serbia kosovo have since under international pressure facilitate referendum in the northern municipality to allow election for new mayor srpska lista again orchestrate boycott frustrate the democratic process and inflame intercommunal tension even far the us have be clear now however that kosovo have fulfil its democratic obligation and the northern mayor be legitimate the eu unfortunately have be less clear in its messaging insist on both sidery approach can the minister confirm that the uk recognise that kosovo have attempt to rectify the situation under its constitution and that regardless of boycott by srpska lista the current mayor be legitimate regardless of their ethnicity also point out how disappointing it be that ethnicity continue to play such an important role in the balkans despite constant impediment by russia and serbia kosovo be on the verge of membership of the council of europe with its application move to the committee of ministers for approval this month membership would mark vital milestone in kosovo progress from the dark day of the kosovo journey be one in which we have play an important role which we should all be proud of however some internationally have say that kosovo should be admit only if it create an association of serb majority municipality the uk should reject that firmly while do not want another republika srpska in the western balkans at all an asm will be create as part of the belgrade pristina dialogue but it can not be rush or extract through external pressure can the minister confirm that the foreign secretary will vote for kosovo admission to the council of europe this month regardless of progress on the asm and encourage all ally to do so more broadly the uk as former member of the quint should assume more active role in the peace talk our current passivity be untenable in the face of such volatile situation we be no long constrain by eu consensus and non recogniser and we must be more inventive in diplomacy we must find not just our voice but our backbone stop stand on the sideline and take action when we have duty to support our ally equally the uk should be engage with the five eu state that do not recognise kosovo sovereignty to help boost kosovo trajectory towards eu and nato membership while solidify the inviolability of its territorial integrity the us and the eu should also adopt resolute posture when address serbia leadership for their role in stoke instability align with putin and increase autocratic tendency at home and abroad the uk and kosovo have fantastic relationship and thank the foreign secretary for visit kosovo early this year to demonstrate that partnership the bond be forge during nato intervention in when british troop help to avert further atrocity and put kosovo on path towards democracy which it have fully embrace our armed force continue to play role after the banjska attack the princess of wales royal regiment quickly deploy to bolster kfor act professionally to defuse the situation likewise the royal regiment of fusiliers deploy last year in period of heighten tension the british army be highly respected and appreciate and be sure the whole house will join in thank each and every soldier who serve there with distinction they make an enormous difference urge the government to work with nato partner to ensure that kfor be give the support and tasking it need to maintain peace and stability across kosovo we should consider the establishment of new security alliance between the us the uk and other willing nato member state with kosovo to help to allay the immediate security concern let give an example of why that be need last december president vučić say that serbia should simply follow the example of azerbaijan in nagorno karabakh and wait for special geopolitical circumstance to allow it to reclaim kosovo that be statement of intent and should not be ignore such comment from head of state be unacceptable indeed vučić threaten last year for speak out against the smuggling of weapon into kosovo my warning be decry by many yet what predict devastatingly come to pass in banjska be grateful to the speaker and to this house for the support be give at that time there be also report of electoral irregularity during the serbian election and the bussing in of people follow by the opposition mp nikola sandulović be kidnap and brutally beat by serbian authoritarian terrorist it be fitting that the serbian opposition operate under the banner of serbia against violence we in this house want to be friend with democratic serbia we want free and fair serbian election there need to be political reform and that begin with free and fair election fear that we be not see that especially with xi jinping today in serbia encourage it to join brics during recent cross party parliamentary delegation visit to albania we witness for ourselves thank to fruitful meeting with the president the speaker ministers mps and other to help strengthen tie that albania be close trust ally in defence and migration the uk government be help to support great deal of work to tackle modern slavery we also witness the uk government support youth initiative in kukës there be also considerable concern in albania and during my recent meeting with the british albanian diaspora about the sovereignty of kosovo do the hon lady agree that the british government must work with albania and other ally to ensure that we help to protect kosovan sovereignty yes we must do that have hop to touch on montenegro but will conclude we can protect the truth in bosnia by vote for un resolution to commemorate the srebrenica genocide we can end dodik threat of secession by transition to nato lead peacekeeping mission under the provision of the dayton agreement we can continue our successful programme of sanction to shut down the account of those who threaten peace in kosovo we can build on the uk proud legacy by vote to admit kosovo to the council of europe and we can redouble our commitment to kfor and extend its mandate by take more proactive approach to counter militia and criminality we can commit to fair and more even handed approach to the belgrade pristina dialogue and in serbia we can work with international partner to promote free and fair election and media environment we must be clear that we stand on the side of the people of serbia and that irredentist dream care little about the people of the balkans it be within our power to support stability and security through deterrence and be resolute in our commitment to the region inaction be choice that we can not make we must not step back and we must not look away call jim shannon thank you so much for call so early madam deputy speaker really appreciate that be rather catch off balance to be truthful check with mr speaker that it be constitutionally all right for to do that we be both rather surprised to find this situation madam deputy speaker you mr speaker and very much believe in the constitution so we be on the same page thank you so much commend the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns for lead the debate with such detailed and helpful contribution also commend she for her leadership as chair of the foreign affairs committee and for her stance in this chamber on these issue in relation to not just the balkans but everywhere she know be impress by her contribution and what she do the current security situation in the western balkans have prompt considerable international concern the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland with its history of engagement and long stand partnership in the region have also raise its voice to the challenge that threaten the development of the western balkans into more stable and resilient region with that in mind it be really important to be here to discuss how we can provide further support and do more there be more elegant speaker than in the chamber look forward to everyone contribution the situation be particularly worry due to russian interference that continue to destabilise and polarise the region the hon lady refer to that in her introduction russia consider the western balkans as an important region in which to exercise its foreign policy by incite instability and division ultimately aim to assert its place as great power in the region medium and disinformation be some of russia great tool in accomplish that and it use they in ukraine and all over the world it be not the only one do it russia continue to interfere in the politic of montenegro often through serbia some nationalist serbs in montenegro be use medium specifically social network to promote russia and pro serbian irridentist political rhetoric the gravity of the situation be clear be concerned that any russian involvement in the western balkans serve only to undermine democracy escalate tension and destabilise the region indeed in the axis of evil russia be right there lead at the top of the pyramid along with other across the world be very much look forward to the contribution of the shadow ministers and in particular if can say so madam deputy speaker my good friend the minister who always encapsulate our thought and concern in way that encourage we look forward to what he will say think it be the hon member for rutland and melton who in november instigate the last debate on the western balkans speak in that debate think that be the last time we debate this issue and reaffirm my position that putin regime be the great threat to prosperity and peace in the balkans condemn any russian interference in the region ask our government our minister and other to join and other in this house in do so it be clear that russia be danger to peace not only in the balkans but in the world and in europe in particular be it any wonder that many other country latvia lithuania estonia poland germany and all those within the russian axis some time ago all fear their very survival from russia intent the russia ukraine crisis pose an additional concern to security and stability in the western balkans while russia invasion of ukraine prompt some balkan government to distance themselves from moscow serbia have show its commitment to its strong tie with russia by refuse to support the eu sanction regime amidst the ongoing conflict again the influence of the axis of evil be clear it rely on russia for gas and oil and on russia support for its denial of kosovo independence however serbia support for the un resolution denounce russian aggression against ukraine and its refusal to recognise russian annexation of ukrainian territory suggest that russia be gradually lose its stronghold on the country only time will tell but it would be very helpful minister to have the thought of the government and the department on that do they see gradual move away by serbia from russian influence some indication show that but whether they be strong enough and deep enough only time will tell the hon gentleman may not be aware that in the last few day aleksandar vulin former spy chief for serbia who have be sanction by the united states government for his involvement in gang and narcotic move to republika srpska and be make senator for life have just be bring back as deputy prime minister do he agree that that be gravely concern and be relevant to his point about people be put in place who have be sanction by the united states and be strong fan of russia do he agree that it can be destabilising and make our partnership with serbia challenge especially when it come to defence and security matter the hon lady tremendous knowledge of this part of the world in particular and the interest that she pursue so assiduously can not be ignore she be right to underline the influence of russia and its wish for people to be place where they can have influence on its behalf and share her concern if the uk bring its global economic strength to partner with serbia and other western balkan state there be potential for those country to increase their resilience against hostile foreign interference and progress towards wide economic development through trade and diplomatic effort the right hon and gallant member for beckenham bob stewart be admire by all of we here for the leadership that he show in the balkans when he be in the armed force and for his knowledge of this subject follow his experience and know that when he speak later he will remind we of how awful that particular war be but if we can move forward and assist the world wide economic development through the trade and diplomatic effort that have mention let we do that we can not ignore the negative but it be always good to find solution as result of positive attitude and focus on our strategy the uk objective for the western balkans include overcome divisive ethnic nationalism and conflict the attack by serbian nationalist militant in kosovo last year be prime example of the necessity for our government to pursue effective action to achieve that objective especially with regard to kosovo serbia relation perhaps when the minister respond to the debate he will give we his thought about how those relation be proceed and what more we can do to bring about solution in the light of the serbian militant attack we remain committed to support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of kosovo and oppose any action to undermine that we or rather our government and our minister have be extremely strong on policy in that regard and their implementation and commend they for their leadership know that every one of we be greatly encourage by it however the response to the attack from kosovo and serbia underscore ongoing tension that can only exacerbate the regional security challenge and we ask our government to join we in condemn such attack the attack be an indicator of nationalist sentiment that have increase in recent year threaten the stability of not only the country involve but the entire region the focus of the debate be on security in the western balkans but what happen there will affect all the surround area as well as the hon member for rutland and melton emphasise in her speech and it be important for we to do our good in that context however we recognise the need for this topic to be debate in the house because the western balkans certainly remain vital to uk and european security we must bear in mind that albania montenegro and north macedonia be our nato partner their people may be culturally or ethnically different but they be morally focused on find solution and find that encouraging their partnership with we be critical in maintain stability in the wide region the stability of the western balkans remain fragile and we can not ignore that the four region of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland come as one and we fight as one in the british army the royal air force and the royal navy which be greatly encourage to see even colleague on the snp benches will be encourage to see those from scotland who serve in uniform before it be too late we must work alongside regional and international partner to change the situation in the western balkans the united kingdom should redouble its effort to address area of need reform in the western balkans include democracy the rule of law and defence against foreign threat thank you again madam deputy speaker for call early in the debate and thank the hon member for rutland and melton for bring forward this issue thank the minister and the government for their leadership and for their achievement so far want that work to continue so call on they to utilise their regional and international partnership which be build on mutual accountability and trust to improve the security situation in the western balkans today we add our voice to the effort to make the necessary change and look forward to the contribution from other who will equally reinforce the importance of today debate some present will recall that be the british battalion commander under un command in bosnia in and since then have give evidence in four war crime trial have visit bosnia frequently over the last year and what happen there and to the people who live there matter to and to all those people who have serve there whether in the military for charity or whatever somehow that country grip we and it matter to people in our country be last in sarajevo just over two week ago principally to attend the remembrance service for the ahmići massacre which take place on april and where people like we be kill those people may well have be muslim but they think like we they just have different religion like we they want to bring their child up they want school and they want thing to work that be why bosnia matter we be very much akin to the people who live there today bosnia remain very fraught place with tension between the three main community bosnian serbs bosnian croats and bosnian muslims could say there be tension between the christian community and the muslim community but would like to point out that there be other people there such as member of the jewish community particularly in sarajevo tension remain just below the surface and sometimes they break through bosnian society today be still like lemonade bottle that someone have pick up and shake they put it down and think all be calm they can see through it and there be no bubble when they take the top off there be an explosion boom tension in bosnia remain ready to explode these tension be of course exacerbate by russian support for republika srpska which russia already treat as an independent state recently at conference in st petersburg it be treat as sovereign entity with its own flag there have be strong indication and maybe more than that over the last few year that russian weapon be go to republika srpska with russian encouragement dodik republika srpska leader whom my hon friend the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns have already mention be block all move by the muslim croat federation and republika srpska those two entity together be the country of bosnia and herzegovina towards eu membership just last week dodik state that thing will change after may which be today many people interpret that to mean that he will push for the secession of republika srpska from the federation of bosnia and herzegovina if that be to happen such change would be disaster for the western balkans and would very likely result in yet another civil war our excellent ambassador to sarajevo julian reilly be really worried about that equally our ambassador be terribly concerned about the number of qualified young people who be leave bosnia youth unemployment in bosnia be at nearly no other country in europe have such an appalling statistic bosnia be bleed its youth and the youth be the future of any country the reason for that statistic be mainly the political situation and the unstable base on which the country sit be my right hon friend concern that there be go to be an easter assembly where dodik and vučić plan to sign declaration around greater serbia what do he think that mean what message do it send about vučić plan and support for the tacit secession of republika srpska thank my good and hon friend for say that totally agree with the implication the real problem be that russia be encourage this to happen republika srpska under dodik be push for it and the serbs will play both side if it be to happen we could have an appalling situation like we have in the early in fairness the british be do all we can to help particularly economically we be try to pump prime bosnia industry to support the setting up of new company bosnia be still govern by the short term rule they be mean to be short term rule agree at the dayton peace conference in the rule be suppose to last couple of year at most but they have never be replace they really need to be sort out to make workable system for everyone who live in bosnia serbs muslims croats whoever everyone be grateful for the service that my right hon friend give to the world he experience and witness trauma to try to bring about that peace and in do so have to deal with many area of corruption do he believe that drift away from the big stick have allow the undermining of the very issue that he say need to be address thank my right hon friend there have be drift we have the most wonderful high representative paddy ashdown who really do wield the big stick and it work his name be still revere and he be friend of mine he remain one although he be go we need high representative with more power and we need the situation to be sort out so that people do not get away with criminal act the mafia be still rampant when be in bosnia have to deal with three side militarily and with the mafia who be appalling do not want to go into how to deal with the mafia because that be not the purpose of this debate but they be always there and they be the people who do not want change interruption have slightly lose my place know should not have write my speech corruption and cronyism remain and be largely support by the system last year when visit tuzla in the north of bosnia meet highly qualified young lady who be desperate to go to medical school and become doctor she have all the qualification but she tell that she could not go because she be not member of certain political party and more importantly because she do not have enough money to bribe the official to put she on list to go to medical school she be in despair and feel that the only future for she and her friend lie in leave the country our country have put lot of effort into support peace and stability in bosnia we have do so on many level politically socially economically lot of economic work have go on in bosnia and of course militarily really believe that our effort have be worth it we have save many life and nothing be more important than to save someone life we have to continue to do that we have to do all we can to help the muslim serb and croat people of bosnia all that the vast majority of they want be decent life one that we be lucky enough to have where their child go to school where they can get job and where they do not need to worry too much about law and order we be lucky to live in this country there but for the grace of god go all of we we could have be bear bosnian it be genuine honour to follow the right hon member for beckenham bob stewart he be revere in this place for his knowledge of the western balkans not only because he read lot about the area and visit bosnia lot but because of his rich experience from the when it be at its most bloody also pay tribute to the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns say humbly as the new member present in the chamber today that chair of the foreign affairs committee ought not just to comment on some of the thing go on in the world today but anticipate what we might see in the future we often come to the house to ask urgent question about event in the middle east or elsewhere that be happen right now but real statespeople look forward and think about what might happen in the future and how we can head that off thank those member who pay tribute to the late lord stunell we be very shocked and sadden by his loss it remind we of another loss in the other place that of lord ashdown when be try to decide whether to speak in this debate or to go out and campaign in the local election have to think what would lord ashdown be more appal by would he be more appalled by my absence from campaign or the debate although it be finely balanced decision think he would have want somebody on the liberal democrat benches talk about the western balkans will concentrate my remark on kosovo not just because of my personal experience spend year there all tell but because kosovo have the most recently change international border in the region in many member of the international community include the uk recognise the state of kosovo one have to pay tribute where it be due and it be good to see that lord cameron visit pristina not long after he be appoint at the beginning of january this year when many other be sleep off hangover my first trip to kosovo be work with kfor on try to encourage serb return to kosovo that remind we that the effort by the international community to build peace in kosovo be ground in try to establish safe and secure multi ethnic environment it be easy to forget just how much effort the international community put into try to keep kosovo very diverse place while be work on serb return meet lady whose husband and child have be dreadfully butcher hang from tree and disembowel later go back and work with the kosovo protection corps an organisation that have grow out of the former kosovo liberation army and subsequently become the kosovo security force for many that be go to be the future army of kosovo have therefore have the privilege of see thing from two extreme side and feel be able to see thing from two very different perspective while there be still strong sense of grievance in the kosovo serb community there be no doubt that moscow be play on that moscow would love to see belgrade act as some sort of satellite or even proxy we have pretty good reason to believe that moscow be delighted to see the middle east burn right now because it serve to distract from its illegal war in ukraine in much the same way we suppose that moscow would be very pleased if the balkans be on fire too thank the hon gentleman for his kind word early in his speech be he aware that when the foreign secretary be give evidence to the foreign affairs committee he describe serbia as proxy of the russian state be not aware of that but it sound feasible we should try to bring serbia away from the mantle of moscow if we can appreciate that be not entirely within our gift one way to do that be through economic mean by try to attract belgrade and serbia to our cause we must think too about the kosovo serbs more than of kosovo serbs have leave kosovo in the past year clearly they be elect to leave unlike what we see in when people be be burn out of their home it be ethnic cleansing on scale that thankfully we have not see in southern europe since my fear be that by legitimise the election that the kosovo serbs choose to boycott we might inflame or enrage that sense of grievance that exist among those kosovo serbs think about the intervention from the chair of the foreign affairs committee be intrigue to see that member of the international relations and defence committee in the other place write letter to lord cameron early this year and among the list of suggestion that they make be one promote bbc albanian service which strike as an excellent idea as it would encourage the spread of our soft power in kosovo when we hear remark about greater serbia we have to pay tribute to how the international community deliberately avoid create greater albania in the wake of the ethnic cleansing in kosovo it deliberately avoid any sense that the international community be seek to annex territory that stand in stark contrast to what russia have seek to do in ukraine it may claim that there be precedent for redrawe international border but it can not point to kosovo as any sort of precedent give that that involve the creation of an independent state and that what we see in ukraine at this time be nothing but aggression and imperial annexation accept the premise that russia be keen to interfere in the western balkans and be seek to stoke tension between serbia and kosovo my feeling be that we must try to avoid the serbs become susceptible to the goading that be come from moscow the proposal from the chair of the foreign affairs committee for trilateral security alliance be an interesting idea what we see in the wake of the invasion of ukraine be pristina appeal to its ally appeal to the united states and to nato to admit kosovo into nato in the absence of that suppose that deterrence through strong alliance with kosovo make whole lot of sense and of course we have see similar proposal in relation to warsaw and kyiv yes deterrence be require but my closing point be that we should not afford moscow great opportunity to appeal to the serbs there be some well educate and well inform serbs who have grievance about what go on in the early we must try to appeal to both the kosovo albanian community and to the kosovo serbs and try to create that much seek after multi ethnic state pay tribute to my hon friend the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns the chair of the foreign affairs committee for secure this debate at such critical time in november be in sarajevo with the nato parliamentary assembly for rose roth seminar which involve series of lecture and presentation we get to hear about what be go on from many angle which lead to the conclusion that could make one statement say one thing and another say the complete opposite there be paradox in the country and the truth of it all depend on one perspective for example people will say that basically nothing have happen since and that the country be in stalemate and be not move forward in many of the area my right hon friend the member for beckenham bob stewart mention in the same breath they say that the country be move forward build more solid foundation and become more trust partner of international institution where the truth lie between those statement be what we be explore in today debate but we know that corruption be still rife and there be too many self serve interest in the interest of time will not repeat the example give by my right hon friend he outline they perfectly especially the example of the young girl who want to start medical career the reality be that if someone be not member of political party or can not pay certain people they can be catch in trap corruption electoral fraud the state of law these be all thing that the government be try to work on in bosnia with the organisation for security and co operation in europe but they be not take major step forward there be however politician and party that be try to break away from the establish corrupt institution we will watch the election with interest over the come year especially in sarajevo as anti corruption candidate start to stand we have responsibility to support those process through organisation that we support such as the osce my right hon friend be absolutely right brain drain be massive issue for bosnia country can not survive and have an economic future if what remain be just the retired population and those who would serve its good interest be leave in people out of population of million leave ten year ago there be vacancy in the military which people apply for last year there be application for vacancy that be stark change in decade military investment in bosnia and herzegovina have stall at for decade that be not enough to maintain the equipment let alone force we then start to see those with corrupt and criminal interest able to get foothold again and more fundamentally not be worried about any consequence there be way that we can turn that around and support bosnia it be about in word that have use already the big stick my right hon friend describe paddy ashdown use that big stick think my right hon friend be little shy about his role in the country do what he could to keep criminality under control the blunt truth be that too many politician be play very dangerous game in bosnia in republika srpska and the surround area when it look as if democracy will threaten their position they launch into nationalist fervour and push that forward that be exactly what dodik do in republika srpska he move to relatively moderate position until it look as though his position be under threat and then become far more extreme it be easy in such debate to discuss where we be and where thing be go we say that what we do in the war be year ago think that sanitise thing slightly remember watch it have to be year ago the bbc drama warrior only watch it once and be traumatise by it it be an excellent drama warrior be base on my infantry battalion and it demonstrate how brilliant well trained and decent our serviceman be in such situation be very proud that warrior win the montreux golden rise for its production be more than grateful to my right hon and gallant friend for make that point he be hold in high esteem in this house in parliament and in the outside world for the role that he play in that operation be come on to say that the reason why have never be able to watch that programme again be that it be horrific be not in the service and do not go out to bosnia watch that drama in my very early and find it so horrific that even though it have be repeat since and even though it be excellent have not be able to watch it that must not be forget the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord outline some of the horrific scene that take place the butchery the savagery the hatred that lead decent people and neighbour to carry out those act we have to recognise they in this house and never forget have the privilege of be the international chairman of the conservative party for period we do lot of work with the westminster foundation for democracy body through which labour liberals and conservatives work with their sister party to help build democracy it be set up after the cold war be proud that be able to work with three faction from the centre right in bosnia to get those right wing party around the table talk and work towards develop well future use to say do know whether this will have any long term effect but at least can one day look my maker in the eye and say that try have very tiny part in try to make peace last because that be what we have to do tragically in my opinion republika srpska representative do not turn up to the rose roth seminar of the nato parliamentary assembly in november apart from one person who very bravely do and get hell of lot of pushback for it its representative have be disengage that be what mean when talk about the dangerous path that they be on take the history of the second world war by about the german society start to teach about the holocaust that be very important moment it turn to education to make sure that history could not repeat itself in bosnia however not only be people not talk about some of the crime against humanity that take place during the war but in some of the school in republika srpska they be actually say it lie it do happen this the problem we ve get to separate out we should be highly concerned about that what lie behind all that be the arm of russia have hear that russia be not directly involve it be not supply arm it be not do some of the thing that it have do in other part of the world such as syria and ukraine however the hand of russia be there politically and disruptively and we do not have to look very far to see it this be critical moment my hon friend the member for rutland and melton and my right hon friend the member for beckenham use the word deterrent one thing we could do today be take british battalion in nato lead operation to those area and act as deterrent do not want any force to have to try to stop the slaughter of innocent civilian we now have an opportunity in that the minister be here to take these point back to the foreign office know that minister be always constrain in what they can and can not say at the dispatch box but we have to send clear message in this debate history do not have to repeat itself we do not have to have programme that have only ever be able to watch once in my life because find they too horrific for let alone for the many member of this house who serve in bosnia or those now in the other place who be ministers at the time and have to deal with the consequence there be ongoing trauma have meet service personnel some of whom serve under my right hon friend the member for beckenham and have hear and see the deep distress that they live with to this day have try to protect innocent civilian that do not have to happen again we can and we need to take action this day that be the responsibility of the develop western world it have responsibility for manage its military and for the ethic that we apply to stop those who purely as part of power grab political game play the nationalistic card which will lead to murder civilian we see that today in ukraine because we do nothing after crimea if we deploy british battalion in bosnia under the very small nato headquarters there it would show that we mean real business and aim to stop thing this time it would by its presence demonstrate power but hopefully it would not have to use force battalion from other country could help too my goodness minister this be time when take little action would have huge dividend be bring my comment to close and my right hon friend have absolutely summarise the point that be try to make be on the nato parliamentary assembly be the chairman of its defence and security committee and lead the uk delegation what do we talk about more than anything else the word deterrent deterrence have to be well than go in to try stop war we can do this today my right hon friend intervention have absolutely sum it up minister if there be one message to take away at the conclusion of the debate it be that we can prevent horror that could happen very soon maybe as soon as the end of this week as the prime minister special envoy for freedom of religion or belief have the privilege of visit kosovo in february have be encourage to do so by the foreign secretary lord cameron go to discussion on freedom of religion or belief with government ministers civil society and faith leader to explore the relationship between different faith group and to gather good practice on freedom of religion or belief in kosovo have the very pleasurable experience of join the kosovo government celebration of the anniversary of kosovo declaration of independence above all the main aim of my visit be to reaffirm the uk commitment to strengthen its relationship with kosovo have visit many country in my year as member of parliament and can honestly say that can not recall warm welcome than the one have from everyone meet in kosovo from the president and prime minister to government official and civil society indeed that warm friendship be start in my first meeting before have even leave the uk my hon friend give we the opportunity to reflect on the fact that none of we want to be stand here talk about conflict in the balkans or just about security in fact when be elect to this place say that would talk about the future for those country thank she for reflect on the fact that those country be full of people who want brightness and future and who be full of joy and hope for their country thank she for bring that moment of reflection which be miss from our debate that be what we want to focus on prosperity future hope and co existence thank my hon friend for that intervention on that national day of celebration have the experience of listen in the parliament of kosovo to reflection by leader after leader about the progress their country have make in democracy in governance and in other way over the past year the pride that they show be heartwarme will give one small example but very real one one of those leader speak about how good it be that now when young child see policeman or man in uniform in the street in kosovo they do not run away in fear it be privilege to be there my first encounter with someone from kosovo be with kosovo ambassador to the uk ilir kapiti be pleased to see that he be watch from the gallery from the first moment meet he he extend the hand of friendship he

pleasure to emphasise how much we want to reciprocate because kosovo be an important country in the region it be an important bulwark of stability against malign influence and very much want to convey the message that the uk want to work with kosovo to strengthen stability in the region and to do all we can to assist that country in do so when go to kosovo not only be all my meeting convivial and productive exhibit deep and endure affection for the uk it be clear to that kosovo and its people display great respect for difference in religion or belief despite or perhaps because of the region

jonathan hargreaves will do all he can to promote that relationship welcome the government of kosovo approach to religious freedom it be excellent to hear shortly after my visit that the government of kosovo have implement the constitutional court decision which confirm the decani monastery ownership of several hectare of land that be practical demonstration of their commitment to religious pluralism and the securing of that be something seek while there although of course claim no credit for the fact that it happen we can not take for grant the continue security of the region and we must continue to address legacy of the past while also work for more prosperous and secure future believe that religious freedom and the work that kosovo be determined to undertake have vital role to play our ambassador jonathan hargreaves he have recently return after begin his tenure there be particularly determined to do all he can to make progress on dialogue with serbian representative and to help promote facilitate and follow up on joint meeting of the independent monitoring committee and the dialogue that we hope will ensue kosovo may not be large country but it have an important role to play in the balkans it be important not only for that region but for the wide stability of the world as we work in an increasingly unstable world the uk recognise the importance of work together to secure that and in my role as the prime minister special envoy for freedom of religion or belief look forward to play my part and hope return to kosovo soon to play my role in the conference which hope will take place later this year call the snp spokesman congratulate the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns on secure this incredibly valuable debate and on her commitment to ensure stability and security in the western balkans not just in her time in this place but throughout her professional career the other incredibly valuable contribution we have hear all speak to member own personal expertise and experience and demonstrate why the backbench business committee be right to grant time in the chamber for this important debate many of my hon friend have work closely with the hon lady and the foreign affairs committee and in some of the parliamentary assembly that be mention on these issue over the year the security and stability of the western balkans affect the security and stability of the wide region especially here in europe as we have hear conflict and dispute in the different country often act as proxy or play for influence by other actor on the global stage sadly much of that be not new anyone who have study basic high school history will know that the root of the first world war be often trace to the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand on the street of sarajevo in june just short of year ago for the many reason we have discuss the region continue to this day to be see as something of tinderbox or powder keg or even shaken but unopened bottle of fizzy lemonade much progress be make especially with the establishment of the dayton accord in but those structure have not be without challenge or strain over the year and there be increase challenge to the status quo as we have hear throughout the debate the increasingly assertive stance of milorad dodik within republika srpska threaten the territorial integrity of bosnia and herzegovina as the motion suggest and tension remain high between serbia and kosovo after cross border violence the ohrid agreement between those country be welcome but it must be follow up with practical action the root of the instability and political instability in particular run deep that in turn have significant consequence across the region include ubiquitous corruption inter ethnic tension strong organise crime autocratic tendency and limited human right the powerful speech about freedom of religion or belief be testament to that organised crime in particular remain challenge and drug and weapon trafficking illegal immigration money laundering contraband or terrorist act all add to the sense of instability and insecurity these factor explain and sometimes compound the opportunity for external influence and exploitation by bad faith actor the hon lady motion refer to russia and the snp join she in her condemnation of russian attempt to amplify tension in the region for its own gain putin clearly see the western balkans as central to his argument for the return of multipolarity in world affair in opposition to what he see as us dominate unipolar order for example by block un recognition of kosovo independence moscow try to position itself as defender of serbian territorial integrity which boost russia popularity among serbs and put pressure on belgrade to maintain friendly relation with moscow as we have hear repeatedly in the debate russia continue to back bosnian serb antagonist both officially through republika srpska and informally through myriad cultural religious educational and paramilitary group at the same time russia full scale invasion of ukraine in have see the western balkan country emerge essentially as new frontline in russia geopolitical confrontation with the west russia have use the medium and information sphere step up its political influence and mobilise proxy organisation to project its narrative protect its interest and slow the region integration into western institution however integration continue to provide something of counterbalance progress continue to be make towards that integration in particular the prospect of accession to the european union and perhaps for some country eventually to nato those be the institution that have promote peace security and economic development among their member country and international partner for decade since the end of the second world war country that wish to join the eu should largely be support and encourage to do so and at least to start make progress towards the different membership criterion that would allow they to pursue membership in future that have not necessarily be the case for the uk government attitude towards the european union there be some irony in promote and encourage expansion in one direction while deal with the consequence of brexit in the other think that be deeply cynical and unfair point to make the people of bosnia and kosovo want to join the eu and therefore it be right we support they in their ambition we be not say we think they should join because we think it be right we be say that if that be what they want if that be their determination we will support they in that journey because it be right for they the hon gentleman point be deeply unfair if be honest it bring domestic politic into debate that so far have rightly focus on the balkans and their people rather than lower down to domestic politic it be disappointing to make that point today take the hon lady point and be not try to upset much of the consensus we have hear today but there have be consequence message be send by the united kingdom when it decide that the european union be not for it many of we during that debate we do not need to rehearse it just now warn that that be potential consequence of the uk decision to leave will not go any far on that and want to agree with the point that have be make there be an important role for the uk to continue to play as the hon lady motion note particularly by increase engagement with international ally and regional partner indeed the counterpart to her committee in the house of lords make number of important recommendation in recent letter to the foreign secretary all of which the snp would welcome be take forward those recommendation include action by the leadership of serbia and kosovo to implement the brussels and ohrid agreement support the high representative in effort to tackle secessionist activity by republika srpska re evaluate the possibility of rejoin operation althea the eu lead peacekeeping mission in bosnia and herzegovina the provision of funding for bbc albanian service the use of long term funding instrument to support development in the region more activity to promote economic growth and combat corruption continue participation in the quint and continue collaboration with eu and us partner on development security reform and democratisation agree with the point that the right hon member for elmet and rothwell sir alec shelbrooke make about the value of the westminster foundation for democracy in that regard speak as someone with some experience of that the hon member refer to operation althea european union lead operation that the uk choose to leave on leave the european union we leave in do he think that the uk would be wise to go back into that operation as it can as an associated state or should there be parallel security arrangement of the sort suggest by the chair of the foreign affairs committee the recommendation of the house of lords committee be that the united kingdom should re evaluate the possibility of rejoin the operation so that be the kind of direction in which there should be travel it be about identify

deeply miss in this place he play key role on the western balkans in the last labour government and continue to take keen interest in the security and stability of the region we be all too aware of the crisis we currently see in the middle east and africa and of course the terrible war in ukraine but we must not lose sight of the strategic importance of other key region and indeed our historic diplomatic military and other obligation to they of course the western balkans be one such region be pleased that despite the many political difference in this place the debate have underscore that there be cross party support and concern for maintain the value of democracy security and stability in the region commitment to the prevention of conflict and atrocity and the defence of fundamental human right as parliament and indeed as country we must recognise the continue tension across the region and this warning have be make many time in the debate their capacity to destabilise the country

serbia part of kosovo and part of montenegro which be nato ally with russia help to cause disruption in history that have happen in similar way all of we could easily be drag into war if we allow this nationalistic fervour to take the route that he be preach the right hon member be absolutely right to highlight some of the deeply irresponsible rhetoric we have hear in recent week as well as over long period we all know the risk pose by that from the historical conflict we have see in the region the concern raise be indeed share by nato as well as by our colleague in the eu the united states and other emphasise that the region be priority for and our shadow foreign affair team as it would be for any future labour government indeed over the past two year have personally meet diplomatic

commonwealth and development office team for all their work just last week meet colleague from albania the bosnian ambassador delegation from kosovo and other envoy across the region as have be

while his family and other be slaughter around he those example will never leave my mind no dynamic underscore the need for our collective engagement more than the endure challenge in the relationship between kosovo and serbia the opposition remain strong supporter along with the government of kosovo independence sovereignty and security early this month it be disappointing to see many in northern kosovo boycott the local referendum only out of register voter cast ballot in the predominantly serb municipality that come despite the government in pristina agree to annul last year local election and hold new one have have the pleasure of visit kosovo as mention and meet member of all community it be clear that there can be positive future for kosovo involve kosovan albanians serbs and other minority it be pleasing to see the kosovan delegation recently visit northern ireland and learn from our example of different community come together and live in peace despite their difference find way forward and political solution we should all want to support those effort we be proud of our historic action in relation to kosovo but it be crucial that we play our part now pay tribute to the uk force who have go in to reinforce the exist uk force in kfor particularly after the incident that have be refer to in banjska and elsewhere it be crucial that those responsible for destabilising be hold to account and bring to justice we must work closely with all colleague to ensure that those tension do not develop in any further devastating direction it be also crucial that we support the decision of people in the region and note the decision of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe to approve its recommendation for kosovo to become its member state it be crucial that any tension be not escalate kosovans must be free to determine their own path welcome the uk government recent statement on this matter hope the minister can outline what recent discussion he have have with eu counterpart the united states and other about the ongoing tension how we can work to prevent further destabilisation and how we can ensure that contribution to kfor continue where do he see the diplomatic dialogue go to normalise relation between belgrade and pristina reference have be make to the internal dynamic within serbia have hear from many figure across the serbian political spectrum it be very important that we support democracy inclusion and stability within serbia and that people be allow to take part in political process there also recognise that there be tension in number of other country which we do not have time to go into today the situation in montenegro and north macedonia both key nato ally have be particularly fragile over recent year have the pleasure of visit skopje and meet political figure across the spectrum what be we do to ensure that those country continue on path of democracy stability and the rule of law we have have extensive discussion today about the situation in bosnia as say meet the ambassador recently we have all join today in raise concern about the rhetoric of milorad dodik and other we have join the government in support sanction against those who seek to undermine dayton when it come to recognition of the past atrocity and otherwise it be about identify those responsible not go against people or whole community as the chair of the foreign affairs committee point out we have also see concern step in republika srpska towards so call foreign agent act mirror development elsewhere and again remove democratic transparency and the ability of human right organisation to hold government to account it be hugely worrying step and would appreciate the minister comment on that finally it have be pleasure to meet colleague from albania another key nato partner in recent week it be good to see increase co operation with albania on migration and trade the british council be play crucial role particularly on the future for young albanians which be rightly raise by my hon friend the member for slough hope the minister can say little bit about the positive step be take in our bilateral relationship with albania the united kingdom have crucially important relationship across the region we must strive to play positive and engage role through our ambassadorial team and through international forum crucial election be take place in the region over the come week we must ensure that security and stability in the western balkans remain priority particularly give the warning in relation to kosovo and bosnia hope the minister will say what step will be take at the upcoming european political community summit which we will be host in july not only to bring together party but to promote peace and stability in this crucial region congratulate my hon friend the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns on secure this timely and very important debate pay tribute to she for her work as chair of the

people of the western balkans clearly deserve the opportunity to live in stable inclusive and democratic society where they can heal the scar leave by conflict and grasp every opportunity to thrive and prosper that be what we be strive towards all six country play their full part in the euro atlantic family of nation with the opportunity and benefit that bring sadly as we have hear today we be long way from the peaceful and stable balkans we all wish to see the contribution from my hon friend the member for rutland and melton and the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady and for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty highlight the context within which we be work democracy be fragile at well political elite be ramp up ethno nationalist tension for their own benefit and russia as be highlight by member across the house be fan the flame of division to distract attention from ukraine and move the region away from the west it be good to see the house unite in call out that behaviour we must of course avoid return to conflict in the western balkans at all cost we be painfully aware of the serious consequence that that would have in the region and beyond meanwhile it be clear that political weakness and instability in the western balkans be threaten the uk security endemic corruption be fuel illegal migration and allow serious organise crime group to thrive and operate in this country include in the drug trade with that in mind we be take multi faceted approach first we be address the driver of instability whether that be dodik push for secession or heighten tension between serbia and kosovo but we be also focus on the underlie factor enable that we be engage with all six country take cross government approach underpin by our programme in the region last year we spend over million on support security and defence prevent conflict and promote media freedom along with effort to tackle corruption and organised crime and to empower woman and girl give the grow instability with all the risk it pose we be prioritise the western balkans in our diplomatic engagement as other have point out the fact that one of the foreign secretary first visit be to kosovo in january demonstrate the importance that we place on our tie with the region indeed the prime minister special envoy to the western balkans lord peach visit the region time last year and make further trip to other interested country as well as engage regularly with international organisation such as nato and the eu the uk have long work with serbia on share priority and will continue to do so make clear the point on which we disagree and judge individual by their action it be not for we to comment on the appointment of individual ministers but it clearly raise question when we see us sanction individual in the government number of issue have be raise today about the relationship between kosovo and serbia we have see an increase in violence include last september terrible attack in banjska which be describe very clearly by my hon friend the member for rutland and melton in every meeting every call and every letter that we exchange with serbian and kosovan leader we urge they to avoid inflammatory rhetoric and escalation and engage constructively in the dialogue only through genuine dialogue and mutual good will can we normalise relation between kosovo and serbia and start to build the bright future that their citizen deserve we also continue to make it clear to the serbian authority that they must co operate fully with effort to hold to account those responsible for the banjska attack take step to tackle cross border arm smuggling and encourage kosovo serbs to return to the institution and serve the community that they represent we have also make clear to the kosovo government the need to ensure that minority community can play full and equal role in the country future we be disappointed that the mayoral recall referendum on sunday april be boycott by kosovo serbs it be arrange specifically to return kosovan municipality to representational governance and it be important for route back to that to be find can confirm to members if they do not already know that the uk will vote for kosovo to join the council of europe point have be raise about investigation of the banjska attack the kosovan police and prosecutor be the appropriate authority to investigate it and it right for we to wait for that investigation to conclude we have previously sanction radoičić the kosovan criminal charge with organise the attack we have urge serbia to hold perpetrator to account and address the ongoing problem of cross border arm smuggling along with other the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord rightly speak of the role of lord ashdown in bosnia and herzegovina but think we all recognise the important role perform there by my right hon and gallant friend the member for beckenham bob stewart he remind we that that country matter and highlight the tension that exist there will never forget visit sarajevo with my family one can not but be move by be in that great city meet its people and be remind of the horror of the past we recognise that we be face the threat of republika srpska secede from bosnia and herzegovina we have condemn dodik secessionist action and have line our steadfast support for the high representative we be work with our international partner to deter further attempt at destabilisation and to support the reform that be necessary for progress towards eu accession the minister have mention deterrence we hear from the right hon member for beckenham bob stewart and the chair of the foreign affairs committee that what might serve deterrence well at this time would be put british battalion or battle group into bosnia do the minister agree with their suggestion and would that be feasible with regular army of at the moment we have no plan to contribute to eufor or to rejoin but we recognise that it be vital for bosnia and herzegovina security and we work hard to support it nato support the force under the berlin plus arrangement and the uk continue to be strong supporter of bosnia and herzegovina armed force that be underline by the deployment of the first battalion royal anglian regiment to train alongside bosnia herzegovina armed force personnel in october and november last year come back to sanction which be an important aspect of the situation in bosnia in january we sanction bosnian medium company for undermine the country constitution that build on the sanctioning in of dodik and the then president of republika srpska željka cvijanović and we constantly keep our approach to sanction under review we will consider target other who continue to seek to undermine the situation in bosnia herzegovina be listen carefully to what my hon friend be say we must be very careful not to allow recent history to repeat itself president obama make it crystal clear that if chemical weapon be drop in syria it would cross red line and would not be tolerate but nothing happen then russia walk into crimea and nothing happen now we have war in ukraine it be all very well say that we will work through diplomacy and sanction but what be really interested in be save life do not expect response now but urge my hon friend to go back to the foreign office and say that this debate have highlight that normal diplomatic route be not go to be enough we need big stick know my right hon friend view well and he communicate they with alacrity and clarity we will reflect on his

rhetoric in montenegro and urge the government to increase its engagement with regional partner and international ally to improve the security landscape of the western balkans pension schemes relevant document third report of the work and pensions committee define benefit pension scheme beg to move that this house have consider pension scheme be grateful to the backbench business committee for allow time for this debate last speak about this issue in half hour debate in westminster hall on january and there have since be number of significant development not least the third report of the work and pensions committee which be good and substantial piece of work be delighted to see its chair the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms in his place and will touch on the report towards the end of my comment event have unfold for the various pension scheme over the last few month and what speak about in january as be particularly pertinent to the beneficiary of the define benefit scheme at bp and shell have begin to look more like wide course of conduct there be significant development under way not least the government recent consultation which could significantly shape the way in which define benefit pension scheme treat their beneficiary in the future although initially think that be deal with couple of oil company now see that it be range of different company yesterday read an alarming brief from the pensioner of hewlett packard it be pretty clear that as this area of pension policy develop an ever large number of large corporate will take the same path as bp and shell ultimately it will be our constituent as beneficiary who lose out if we get it wrong and if these company be allow to do as they wish rather than as they ought on the position of their pensioner be grateful to the right hon gentleman for secure this debate have be contact by three retire member of exxonmobil which have very large refinery in my constituency be reluctant to name the firm because have not have chance to ask for its side of the story but the three letter tell that exactly the same thing have be happen those three people be give no discretionary rise this january and it be then modestly reinstate after protest be make there be clearly some sort of co ordinated effort and not in good way exactly as the right hon gentleman describe it pain to say it but think the right hon gentleman be absolutely right what might have start with the oil and gas company be clearly go much wide should declare an interest as hope to be the beneficiary of define benefit pension if live that long have be in the house before the move to career average earning in will not rehearse what say about the decision of bp shell and other not to pay discretionary increase which matter significantly to their pensioner at time when inflation be run north of however it be worth remind the house that fundamental point of fairness be at stake here when one be past retirement age one no long have the choice one have when one be of work age if someone in employment be unhappy with the money they get for the work they do they can look around and find another job or they may choose to retrain and do something else more profitable once someone be of retirement age they no long have that choice and flexibility which be why it have long be establish as matter of public policy that the beneficiary of pension scheme require protection after all this be simply defer income with our be pay later after we have stop work for the service we have do it be fundamental aspect of that protection that it should take as its starting point the undertaking that be give at bp and shell and do not doubt exxonmobil people be give vigorous encouragement to join pension scheme and invest in they they be give undertaking at the time that one advantage of big pension scheme at company such as that be that they would later in life have an income that be protect against inflation so question of good faith be at play here have no doubt that for many of the big corporate the bp shells hewlett packards and so on the possibility of pay money to those who be no long economically active and contribute to their business be tiresome and inconvenient never cease to be amazed by the extent to which those at the top of these big corporate seem to think that somehow the corporate be as big as they be simply because of the role that they have play they do not seem to understand that they be the inheritor of business that be build by other who be now among those who would be the pension beneficiary if one be to stand on the shoulder of other it be always good to respect the fact that one enjoy the view one have because of the shoulder on which one stand be sorry to say that that seem to have be forget in the boardroom of too many of our large corporate have express these concern about bp in particular before remind the house that have large number of bp pensioner in my constituency because for many year bp operate the oil terminal at sullom voe it be good employer and we value its presence in the community for many decade be concern now to see that bp pension fund trustee with collective year of membership of the fund have be replace with four with precious little involvement two of whom be citizen of the united states since we last debate this issue both shell and bp have again refuse any discretionary increase to their beneficiary in essence they be double down the briefing have receive from the shell pensions group be of particular concern as it be craft succinctly and concisely shall with your indulgence madam deputy speaker read it into the record it say shell have impose this benefit cut upon its pensioner during period when the fund be in healthy surplus and well able to afford full cost of living increase without call upon shell sponsor covenant and shell its shareholder and senior executive benefit hugely from the same energy crisis that be already cause their pensioner extremely high rise in their cost of living the shell pensions group have do considerable and detailed research on that point from the actuarial report and the scheme account it conclude that during the same period instead of balanced approach use about of the surplus as quote by shell as necessary for full cost of live increase to the immediate benefit of the of member whose pension be currently defer or in payment the trustee have largely opt to dissipate the surplus by massively accelerate completion of its low reliance upon shell investment transition plan this fifteen year plan be commence in but with the acceleration opportunity provide by the surplus arise from increase bond deal it be almost fully complete in that be where the money that could have fund the pension increase have go it have go into accelerate programme that be suppose to take year and instead have be conclude in four year be afraid to say to the minister that the shell pensions group also have strong concern about the consultation that he launch on february under the heading option for defined benefit scheme it say we be therefore aghast that the pension minister open new consultation with view to identify way of encourage and enable sponsor of db scheme to claw back surplus we feel that the foregoing demonstrate that sponsor require no assistance or encouragement in that and on the contrary strong measure be necessary to hold the surplus for the benefit of the beneficiary particularly in contributory scheme in which they have invest their own money by way of defer salary and additional voluntary contribution the select committee report have give careful consideration to this matter along with most of those to whom speak be well pleased with the recommendation of the report in that regard bp also continue to double down there continue to be no formal engagement with the pensioner group what the previous chief executive officer call the engagement strategy would have love to have be at bp annual general meeting this year by all account it sound to have be heated affair the analysis publish recently in the times by its financial editor tie in very well what bp be do with the concern we should all have about the future direction of travel in recent article the financial editor write everyone at least pay lip service to the notion that meet pension promise in full be paramount no surplus should be touch without meaty asset buffer be build up no sponsor should be allow to extract cash without show strong covenant provide reassurance that it will still be around to pick up the piece if thing go wrong but even those safeguard be nearly enough to fully protect member accord to trenchantly argue submission from ginger group of bp pension fund member the bp pensioners group attempt by employer to evade their promise will be legion it say they will trim back or remove any benefit possible they will abuse loophole in the rule to maximise their clawback they will push hard to minimise what member should reasonably expect it also warn that the prospect of executive bonus be fatten up by success in grab back surplus will be far more potent in drive company behaviour than any residual feeling of responsibility to ensure scheme pay every last penny of promise pension the message be that it could all end up in an unseemly scramble the article continue the bitter dispute with bp be just foretaste of how relation between many other db pension fund member and their former employer be go to sour if the surplus grab reform be push through without proper safeguard the old world be dead that sum up very well the tension between surplus clawback and the need to honour the commitment that be give to beneficiary we see so often this mismatch which affect the ability of the citizen to take on the big corporate or the big public body this be just the private sector version of what happen to the sub postmaster the post office be big enough strong enough and well enough connect simply to ignore the sub postmaster to lie about they to straight bat their concern and to deny what be obvious to everyone until they could no long manage to do so what be the agenda here and ultimately who will be the winner and the loser it be pretty obvious that the pensioner will not be the winner we should consider the reputational damage that the issue be do to bp and shell obviously any oil and gas company these day have to be fairly thick skin corporate entity but still ask myself why they simply refuse to engage why be they deny the very obvious and clear justice of the case be put forward by their own pensioner group find it difficult to see any explanation other than that the fund be be fatten up before be hive off to insurance company or other the times the thunderer be not the only news outlet to have report on bp pension recently on march the pr newswire report case in houston texas in which the judge tell bp that it must reform its pension plan follow an eight year legal battle over pension loss again we be deal with big corporate which have deep pocket and can see off the attention of the small pension beneficiary pr newswire say group of standard oil of ohio sohio oil worker receive win decision after an eight year legal battle with bp corporation north america bp in huge victory for oil worker with federal judge rule that bp this be worth pay attention to commit fraud or similarly inequitable conduct in how it announce pension formula change more than year ago federal judge george hanks rule that bp violate the employee retirement income security act erisa of and plaintiff that is the worker be entitle to appropriate redress by equitable relief the court rule plaintiff demonstrate bp commit multiple violation of erisa in its communication to its employee the sohio retiree maintain since bp have insist the new formula would provide benefit as good as or well than the old formula the judge agree and find there be pension shortfall for many it be worth reflect exactly what the people who take that case be motivate by the work that they have do for bp the article continue fritz guenther lead plaintiff dedicate his work life to bp often in dangerous condition on the north slope of alaska he work two week on two week off for year rely on bp representation regard his retirement while he be still healthy he say many of his colleague face health issue while other still have die within the past eight year the retiree legal fight be take place against backdrop of retirement wave nationwide with the us census bureau estimate that one in five americans will reach the age or old by that be the nature of the commitment that bp employee in america give to the company and it be measure of the moral bankruptcy that appear to be at the heart of that corporate that it could not see that payback be necessary for these people in their retirement will touch briefly on the work and pensions committee report to which have repair apologise for do something that be always tell not to do as law student will read from the rubric rather than the substance of the report welcome what the committee say about scheme surplus and governance in particular the executive summary say many scheme be much close than they expect to be able to enter buy out arrangement with an insurer to secure scheme benefit touch on that early the committee be also right to talk about the various reason why the flexibility would be advantageous to wide interest there be balance to be strike between the company the beneficiary and the national interest in relation to the money be available for investment that balance have to be properly strike and it will inevitably slew towards the interest of government and corporate interest unless the necessary protection be put in place the committee also observe we note the current consultation on the level of fund scheme would need to have for surplus extraction to be an option however strong governance will also be essential we recommend that dwp should conduct an assessment of the regulatory and governance framework that would be need to ensure member benefit be safe and take step to mitigate the risk before proceed in this brave new world for define benefit pension that be warning that the minister and the government would do well to take onboard if they do not be afraid that the loser at the end of the day will be our constituent the beneficiary of such pension scheme we will look back in year to come and we will see that the case of bp shell exxonmobil hewlett packard and other be simply the canary in the coalmine call the chair of the work and pensions committee welcome the debate and congratulate the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael on secure it at time when lot be happen in pension policy will take advantage of its broad scope to comment on wide issue as well as pick up on the point that he make agree with great deal of what he say auto enrolment which be devise by labour government legislate for under the coalition and implement under subsequent conservative governments have be huge success in increase the number of employee save for pension but lot of challenge remain above all the amount that people be save under auto enrolment be not enough for an adequate retirement income and if we do not increase pension saving soon we will have crisis of inadequate pension income before very long the gender pension gap remain much too big pension save among self employ people to whom auto enrolment do not apply have plummet the chancellor be rightly look at how he can boost investment in the uk economy from pension fund but uk pension fund for understandable reason some of which the right hon member for orkney and shetland touch on have largely withdraw from investment in company as regulation have push they to reduce the risk that they face we must not force those define benefit fund that be still open and invest to close prematurely the right hon gentleman highlight this afternoon as he have previously he mention his debate in westminster hall that member of some define benefit pension scheme such as those of bp and shell and think exxonmobil as the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis point out have in recent year not receive the discretionary increase that they use to we look at that issue in the select committee report on define benefit pension scheme which we publish on march we take oral evidence from the bp pensioner group and we also hear from the hp pension association the right hon member for orkney and shetland also mention that company the association represent people who previously work for the computer company digital which hewlett packard acquire much of those people work life be before there be no general requirement to uprate pension in payment before and our witness tell we that hewlett packard pensioner have receive only three discretionary increase to benefit amount to in total since which be just over year in our report we call for the pensions regulator to find out how many scheme have discretionary increase on benefit in their rule and how that discretion have be exercise in recent year give recent improvement in scheme funding level we also call for dwp to look at way to ensure that scheme member reasonable expectation for benefit enhancement be meet particularly where there have be history of discretionary increase perhaps the minister when he wind up would comment on whether he will look at the reasonable expectation for benefit enhancement for scheme member with lot of service and whether they can be meet the hewlett packard pension association be call for code of ethical practice to be draw up between the pensions regulator and dwp particularly on pension and for their former employer and its pension trustee to work out policy for sustainable future discretionary increase be grateful to the right hon gentleman for touch on an area that should perhaps have give more attention to the most important protection we can give the beneficiary be through ensure that there be independent trustee and that the office of trustee can not be manipulate by the company do the select committee have any proposal for improvement in that regard the right hon gentleman be quite right we have note bit of move towards sole trustee in number of case which clearly give rise to concern about how one person can represent the interest of the member of pension scheme we be reflect on that in our work but one of the member of the hewlett packard scheme write to this week he may well also have write to other member about the further fear and despair they be now feel as it dawn upon they that their company and pension scheme trustee be meanwhile prepare plan to derisk by transfer their pensioner responsibility to an insurance company something the right hon gentleman touch on that transfer will quite possibly mean no subsequent possibility ever for increase he call that frightening prospect and it be hard to disagree the committee also look at concern about the new define benefit funding regime to be introduce for scheme valuation from september we note that the regime have be develop in different era when the vast majority of db scheme be in deficit and amidst concern that employer be seek to evade their responsibility to underfunde scheme there have be big change since then especially in the wake of the liability drive investment crisis follow the budget of month or so ago in particular there have be significant improvement in scheme funding but the principle of the new regime have not be change scheme be expect to target position of low dependency on the sponsor employer mean low investment risk at the point of significant maturity that have promote concern that the funding code will when introduce force more unnecessary de risk particularly among open scheme as well as among those that be close but have long time horizon which would increase cost to employer and result in premature closure we say that the dwp and the pensions regulator need to act urgently to ensure they do not inadvertently finish off what few open scheme remain by far increase the risk aversion in letter to the committee on december the minister tell we that both the department and the pensions regulator be acutely aware of the need to take account of the specific need of open scheme and he agree that open scheme should not be force into an inappropriate de risk journey we welcome that assurance but it need now to be reflect in the final wording of the funding code and in the regulator approach the vote in parliament on the statutory instrument come before the final version of the funding code be publish so member do not quite know what they be vote for at that point we recommend that the department and the pensions regulator should work with open scheme to address their concern particularly on the employer covenant horizon the length of time for which they be confident in the sponsor employer willingness and ability to support the scheme and report back to we on how they will do so before the new funding code be lay before parliament since our report be publish feedback from scheme suggest that thing may not be move in the right direction in consultation response last week the university superannuation scheme large and still open scheme describe the regulator propose approach as not fit for purpose for open db scheme in its view the statement that it will be require to complete under the term of the new code will demand significant resource for little or no benefit to our member to the uss and to that appear inconsistent with the assurance that open scheme will not be adversely impact by the new funding regime the uss add not have have sight of the revise funding code and accompany covenant guidance have exacerbate their worry know that the minister understand these concern well closure of those scheme would reduce pension fund investment in the productive economy at time when the chancellor want absolutely rightly to increase investment from pension scheme into the productive economy can the minister tell we when he expect the new funding code to be publish whether he will report back to the committee before then on how the concern of open scheme have be address and whether he be open to consider separate chapter in the funding code set out how the code will apply to open scheme let take few minute to talk about what be happen on the define contribution side of the picture wonder whether the chair of the select committee share my concern that when those scheme go wrong it seem to take an interminable time to get any form of resolution have in mind scheme that be sure he be familiar with the atomic energy authority technology pension scheme the government give strong guarantee from the dispatch box that transfer into that scheme would give benefit roughly similar to those of remain in the original atomic energy authority scheme but that do not happen first quote the concern of my constituent dr keith brown in the most recent answer that receive to question on this subject be this be complex issue require further consideration between the dwp and the cabinet office first raise the matter in but the government be still say that in the right hon gentleman make very fair point that be certainly very long run case and the select committee have recently be look at notable pension scam case the norton motorcycle company pension scheme which be straightforward scam that have be run for year and year he be right that we need to find way to speed up some of these process because the victim in these case have their life really blight we be allow that blight to last for year and year and that need to change on the issue of define contribution scheme the committee publish report in september on save for later life which point out that auto enrolment have be very big success double the proportion of eligible worker save in pension applaud the approach now be take by uber follow the supreme court case that it lose and the recognition agreement that it now have with the gmb trade union it be now auto enrol large number of its driver into pension scheme albeit with high opt out rate than elsewhere which be make some real inroad into pension scheme saving in the gig economy we need much more of that among other gig economy worker however many auto enrol people be not contribute enough at the moment for an adequate retirement income and quite lot of they be probably not aware of that contribution rate need to go up as such the committee recommend that the government should first implement the recommendation of the auto enrolment review reduce the minimum age for auto enrolment from to and minimum contribution be pay from the first pound of earning almost all of our witness support those measure and we welcome royal assent be give to the legislation that will implement they that legislation require public consultation on implementation and for its finding to be report to parliament before the regulation be make however as yet there have be no consultation and nor have any date be announce for it so can the minister tell we when the department will be consult on implementation of those regulation will that consultation be launch before the end of this parliament and do he still expect as the government have long maintain that those change will be implement by the we always know that auto enrolment would lead to many small pension pot people change job so they accumulate on average pension pot across their work life by november there be over million defer pot under the department for work and pensions have propose automatic default consolidation to deal with small pot but that will not in itself stop small pot from build up in future as such the department have propose lifetime provider model with member choice so that employee tell their employer which pot to put their contribution into and pot for life so that employee stay in the pension scheme they start out in throughout their work life unless they choose to move consultation response on those proposal raise some very serious concern from the tuc age uk and the pensions and lifetime savings association and the association of british insurers the main industry body age uk for example say that the proposal would be highly disruptive and lead to poor outcome for mass market saver major concern raise in the response include potentially unwind the consensus on auto enrolment that other measure in train such as pension dashboard value for money and consolidation will reduce the number of small pot anyway and improve value that the proposal would benefit saver with large pot but harm low income saver and that they would increase employer cost while entirely remove their role in select pension scheme for their staff have hear time and again as be sure the minister have how important employer be to trust in pension saving and that employer have deliver in auto enrolment what we have ask they to deliver other such concern be that these change would require new infrastructure which would be hard to build as pension dashboard have certainly prove to be and that they distract attention from the important effort to increase auto enrolment contribution over time which the response argue correctly think should be the main focus of change over the next few year the minister will be very familiar with all those concern will he tell we when the department will publish its response to the lifetime provider model consultation and do he acknowledge that response to the consultation so far have indicate very significant risk in the government proposal for rather limit gain there be lot go on in this area be very grateful to the right hon member for orkney and shetland for give the house the opportunity to reflect on all this at this particular time there have be some good progress for example with auto enrolment but lot more work be need look forward to hear the minister reply it be pleasure to follow the chair of the work and pensions committee my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms and thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure the debate it give we chance to raise number of issue and have listen with particular interest to the remark about define benefit scheme and the recent report of the select committee which be what want to talk about today speak as the mp for cardiff south and penarth on behalf of the many individual affect by the collapse of the allied steel and wire pension fund that of course affect not just constituent in cardiff south and penarth but people across south wales and in other location in the uk have regularly meet constituent and other affect by that terrible injustice over the time have be in the house have hear the passionate way in which they have make their case which be break they put into pension scheme expect define benefit after many year of service in tough industry steelmaking which have proud tradition in my constituency as it do across south wales yet they have not receive what they pay in for that be essentially because the employee be member of the asw pension plan and the asw sheerness steel group pension fund both of which be wind up underfunded those member end up have to rely on the financial assistance scheme which as have be say provide financial assistance to member of define benefit pension scheme who lose all or part of their pension follow their scheme come to an end between january and april the arrangement that be make resulted in theory in member receive something broadly equivalent to of the expect pension which be obviously less than what they expect to receive but this could be reduce if it be above the fas cap of course member who have pay in substantial amount before april do not receive any index link which mean that the value of their pension pot have be substantially reduce even the funding that go in after that date will not have keep pace with actual inflation because it be relate to the increase of up to maximum of the net result be that many of they receive somewhere between and less than they feel they be entitle to those member many of whom pay into the scheme in good faith have often explain to very clearly how they be originally sell the scheme they be tell it be go to be absolutely solid as solid as the steel they be make yet they find themselves in real difficulty in later life sadly many of those member have since pass away or suffer illness financial hardship mental distress and many other issue during that time the hon member raise point that have be particularly concerned about constituent have recently come to because they be face problem get their pension entitlement from police scotland so from public sector pension one of the lesson we need to learn from these continual scandal be that we need to act quickly because the long we take the more people lose out and people pass away and never get the justice they deserve agree with the hon lady indeed that be reflect in what the committee set out which will come to in moment quite understandably those pensioner have make it clear to that they see themselves in the ilk of other huge historic injustice such as those we have hear about in recent month with the sub postmaster horizon scandal and the infected blood scandal obviously the long it go on the more pain and financial and mental distress they endure and tragically many pass without receive any of what they be entitle to and certainly not the full amount have meet numerous pensions ministers and write to they many time have speak in this house many time and tell the story of these pensioner thank shadow front bench colleague in particular the act shadow secretary of state my hon friend the member for wirral south alison mcgovern and my hon friend the member for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft who be on the front bench today also thank previous shadow pensions ministers include the late jack dromey for all they do to engage with pensioner but people be still not get the answer that they rightly expect will come on to the response that have have from the minister in due course let turn briefly to the recommendation in the dwp report which know the minister be familiar with its recommendation state financial assistance scheme member be likely to have more of their service before so be particularly likely to be affect by non indexation of benefit any improvement for ppf member should also apply to fas member give the age of many fas member the government should legislate as matter of urgency to provide indexation for right the government should review the financial assistance scheme include look at the case for remove other discrepancy in fas compensation compare to the ppf paragraph of the report state like the deprived pensioners association and prospect the pensions action group which have work on behalf of these pensioner over many year say that indexation on benefit be its priority most fas member have the majority of their service before and most be in scheme that provide for indexation of between and on all member pensionable service non indexation of benefit mean that the average fas award be progressively low than the amount expect from the original pension scheme terry monk say people should get what they pay for end of story if people pay for it they should get it that be sentiment have hear over and over again from my constituent and other as say have engage with many pensions ministers there have be many over the year while have be in the house and have letter from the minister on april regard those on whose behalf write to he it say be aware of and welcome the report of the work and pensions select committee into define benefit pension these be complex matter which require careful consideration any solution need to be balance and take account of the interest of financial assistance scheme member and taxpayer who fund the scheme therefore be now actively consider next step with an aim to publish our response in early summer will the minister meet my constituent and other representative who have be campaign on this for so long will he give some timeline for when he expect to respond to the select committee and the specific point will he provide his department estimate of the cost involve and say how those weigh up in different scenario this issue obviously affect thousand of individual have hear different figure quote at different point for address the concern and it would be good to understand his independent assessment passionate case have be make by my constituent and those affect this be highly publicise scheme the former asw site be now under new ownership but it be still at the heart of my constituency and visible sight in butetown and tremorfa many of those affect live locally and do not get what they think they be go to get that have cause huge distress to they and their family we need to provide they with some answer and urge the minister to look carefully at the case they have make and at the finding of the committee it be pleasure to speak in this debate and congratulate the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael on secure it and the backbench business committee on grant it this be an important matter no matter what age people be appreciate that today we be not talk particularly about state pension but call on those on the shadow front bench to please desist from this scaremongering about what may be happen with state pension all party have commit to have the triple lock in their election manifesto and it have work well there have be big uplift in the state pension since we work on that with the liberal democrats when we be first in coalition and have continue with it with couple of exceptional reason in the pandemic once when we use primary legislation to ensure that people could get the triple lock and again when we recognise the unusual situation with covid earning we know that pensioner have welcome the significant increase in their first state pension payment of this tax year with most of they see that significant uplift in the week just go the former secretary of state say we should not be scaremongere but there be some serious concern do she accept that the pensions regulator report say that the mini budget of the former prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss contribute to billion drop in pension fund asset which have affect every pensioner and every potential pensioner in this country will the former secretary of state not at least accept some responsibility for that certainly will not accept responsibility for that be conscious of the arrangement with the pension regulator but also the situation that happen with liability drive investment the bank of england see that as risk in and do nothing about it come back to the fact that the state pension be well trusted and well regard and it be scaremongere to suggest anything otherwise be conscious that today we be talk about private pension scheme in my short time as secretary of state for health and social care what come up time and again this government address it be the reduction in the lifetime allowance to about million which the conservatives have introduce appreciate that for many people it would be mountain to climb to get to that kind of pension pot but for doctor consultant and some nurse the lifetime allowance be prove barrier to they continue to work within the nhs sensible approach be take and be pleased we have do that one thing that have be constant be the generous tax element for private pension it be why we have have such successful industry and why there be difference between we and many other country around the world in what come from the state directly and what come through private pension recognise that the previous labour administration put in place the building block for auto enrolment and the creation of the national employment savings trust and that be good thing to do be pleased that we start that journey just over decade ago contrary to the prediction it be good to see how many young people do not opt out that be huge success story and it be why share with the chairman of the select committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms keenness to make sure we get on with the consultation to which he refer be sure the minister will answer that point appreciate that there will always be concern about the possible impact on job get it and it may be that we need two stage consultation one stage about age and one consider low earning level it would be good to get on because everybody realise that the soon people start the more they benefit that be an important part of why auto enrolment have be such success another recent change in legislation be the creation of collective define contribution scheme clearly there be still some interest in those and royal mail be potentially close to start one we should see what we can do to advocate for that model for many institution this be brave comment to make in this speech but wonder whether parliament should lead by example and see whether the members of parliament pension scheme should move to this approach be conscious that the taxpayer pay for our contribution through the government and so on and we have an uncertain career path by become member of parliament but where something be good enough for other and we be create legislation for it we should consider lead by example and give some impetus to that new legislative vehicle may not be popular for say that and be conscious of how some of the issue with the mccloud judgment and similar matter lead to two tier system which have now be rectify however that scheme undoubtedly need not be as complex be pleased about the change that happen in the treasury respond to call from department such as the dwp which lead to an opening up through the mansion house reform of the consolidation of fund and aspect of super fund what we need from pension investment be good return so that our pensioner will be prosperous that be ultimately what this be about and we need to galvanise what we be do to ensure that be not one of those people who believe that we will be retire at or whatever far from it there be rational end to that approach it will not necessarily take courage but it will require some imagination co ordination and collaboration to ensure that we have sustainable pension outcome for the future that be where we can start to learn from other country when be in the department for work and pensions be interested in what be do in japan dare say if end up do another phd in the future it will probably be on how pension be part fund in japan recognise its age demographic we should recognise that that be the situation in our country too we should not be all doom and gloom about this issue we need to innovate but we can also look at what other have do to address it there be another really important thing start work in for company call mars where it be little known to do not realise how beneficial this be be on final salary define benefit pension scheme with zero contribution do not have to contribute penny over time that do not stay affordable for mars have not appreciate that benefit think to some extent that be why auto enrolment be so successful but in that job learn the importance of make sure that employer be careful with how they manage pension on behalf of employee and the role of the trustee we can think back to robert maxwell raid pension know that mars sell business to his company and that go wrong in term of the pension people may not be aware that pension be not include as part of the tupe process they be specifically exclude recognise how they could limit sensible company merger and acquisition but be conscious of how people may not really think about that until much later in life to return to the reform and why they be necessary the trustee be so important have hop that we would have year of the trustee campaign although be trustee be an interesting role to have admit that have never be one although have express interest in the past it mean be heavily involve in regulation that could be overwhelming at time for people who may want to be trustee because they believe in the people they work with and those who work there before they as well as be mindful of the future but who be not necessarily well verse in all the in and out know that the fiduciary duty be really drum into trustee for define contribution scheme in particular where candidly there be no expectation of what the outcome will be the hammer home of that fiduciary duty have lead to low risk approach which have be very low cost but with very low return that be not what we should want no wonder people be buy other home and become landlord they see fix asset which they know they can sell in the future and on which they can make reasonable expectation whereas people put money into their pension pot have no huge sense of what that could buy they in the future we have change the law so that people do not have to put everything into an annuity but it still be matter of concern be conscious that there have be issue with the pension dashboard and hope that the money and pensions service will solve that perhaps the minister can update we on progress in that regard it be vital that people start to look at that now not just as they be about to retire what be the benefit of the reform and why should there be sufficient professional advice those intermediary adviser often get significant fee but still recommend that people go for gilt and pretty low return there be different way hope that the reform will start to be take up by the industry which ask for they in order to take full advantage and recognise the issue ahead we need to see the impact of the change in legislation and the variety of consultation we make the change to improve prosperity for pensioner now and in future would be keen to hear from the minister if there be any news on market trend in that regard the local government pension scheme should lead by example the government have put great demand on local government through level up but be vital that we see that change there be second part of pension scheme that be worth raise wonder whether member know just how many trillion of asset there be in uk pension alone the answer be about trillion organisation such as make my money matter be try to encourage people to use their future pension pot to ensure we have thriving planet do not agree with the divestment approach but it be important that company invest in the energy of today be invest in the energy of the future without the support of pension fund we will not get that necessary investment pension be superpower for the prosperity of people and the planet be pleased when we introduce the regulation on disclosure of alignment to the paris agreement would like to go far and encourage the secretary of state to bring forward similar regulation to apply to nature work have already start the task force on climate relate financial disclosures make it happen for carbon think we be the first in the world to do that by the way we can do the same for nature the taskforce for nature relate financial disclosures be good comparison the international sustainability standards board be look at that and we be close to get that outcome appreciate that the minister may not have consider that recently and he may not be able to respond but encourage he to do that we only have certain amount of time although hope that as science allow we to live long we will claim our pension for long so we want to ensure prosperous future on the superpower element praise nest which have do great job it be set up just over decade ago and now manage huge amount of money there be even room for it to expand through consolidation which the pension protection fund could also look at nest be lead by example as pension firm that be start to invest in the energy of the future with substantial proportion of its fund rather than rely on gilt and similar nest should be truly celebrate although fiduciary duty must be the no priority let we try to get more trustee to recognise that they be responsible for ensure that the return from dc scheme be as good as the benefit for member of define benefit scheme we need to release the market and protect people as we have do pension be superpower be not necessarily the sexy thing to say in this chamber but it be one of the most important decision that we have make in legislation in recent year we need to continue that momentum thank and commend the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for lead today debate attend his half hour westminster hall debate on this issue and support he when he outline his case in the short time he have he have do exceptionally well today in do the same thing but in much more detail it be important to discuss pension scheme and to ensure they be properly understand and regulate there be still so many people out there who be misinformed or do not really understand how pension work or what their purpose be so be glad to be able to debate this issue the chair of the work and pensions committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms refer to auto enrolment want to refer to it too the right hon member for orkney and shetland set out lot of detail as do the chair of the select committee and other refer to number of company most people will obtain pension at some stage of their life and through employment will actively pay into it one point would like to make and which the chair of the select committee refer to relate to the provision of pension for our young people and what step we can take to ensure they understand that provision this be another issue that believe should be teach within learn for life and work it should be in the curriculum and part of our focus the right hon member for orkney and shetland say that he have his first pension at the age of have my first pension at the age of my mother take down to john thompson he be not here any more who be the pension man in ballywalter say do need one he say oh you do and sign up of course you never say no to your mum certainly do and do not regret that over the year and after take out other pension all of sudden they be quite valuable and exceptionally good to have also when be an year old my mother take down to the northern bank now danske bank and open an account for she give to start the account way back in the that be quite lot of money you could probably have buy wee car at that time be not sure what state the car would have be in but think you could have buy one for or thereabout the point be make be that it be important to save and to have pension we ask young people to look to their future and to start to plan but there be little provision within the education system to teach they about pension saving and mortgage and there should be know that that be not the minister direct responsibility but perhaps he could give some assurance on whether it could become subject for the curriculum have have conversation with my staff on the importance of pay into pension my young staff member response be exactly that she buy her first house save for almost decade for the deposit and pay thousand of pound for mortgage adviser insurance solicitor fee and lender fee young people be just about survive to live in the present but there be now an expectation that they must save in pension for their future the purchase of house be such critical factor that pension often take second place what step can be take to ease the financial burden on our young people and enable they to see the benefit of take advantage of pension recently ask parliamentary question on consideration be give to potential opt in scheme for young people under the age of there be massive cause for this another two girl in my office have be work since the age of part time obviously but still work and so many young people out there be employ from as young as that why should they reap some sort of benefit from work at that age understand the government be to make change to the pensions extension of automatic enrolment act to enable that to happen in the as we quickly approach that perhaps the minister could give an update on the matter and where it stand my last point on pension relate to the waspi woman this be not the subject of today debate and there will be debate on it in fortnight time secure debate last month in westminster hall on the issue although it be not the pension issue for today debate the scale of the issue and its popularity highlight the importance of plan pension that be the point want to refer to the minister will be aware that compensation be owe but give the nature of today debate let gently remind he that it be possible for lesson to be learn in set the scene the right hon member for orkney and shetland speak of what have go wrong and the need to ensure that it would not happen again and we hope that as result of this debate and other the issue of the waspi woman will never happen again either the incentive to save for the future must be there for people of all age not just young people but those in their and who voluntarily do not pay into their pension because they do not think it worth their while give the current cost of living and the many demand on their purse it be also worth note that some employer match employee contribution while other pay considerably more the incentive must be there for people to prepare for life after work and firmly believe that that should start in the llw and career sector of the education system we should learn they early we should reach young people in the right way and prepare they for the world that be to come and pension be clearly part of that thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael and the chair of the work and pensions committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms for their work in bring this important matter to the house the right hon member for orkney and shetland mention pension scheme include those of shell and bp but want to focus on the hewlett packard enterprise pension scheme and decision that directly affect more than people live in my constituency and in neighbouring constituency speak on behalf of my constituent patricia kennedy as well as member of the hewlett packard enterprise uk pension scheme which include more than member of the hewlett packard pension association these be people with an average of year loyal service the bulk of it they be promise good pension they expect fair deal from world lead corporation that they help to build but now find themselves leave with raw deal in general their pension now have less than of the expect buying power in digital equipment corporation of massachusetts open factory in ayr the company know locally as digital be major boost to the local economy and indeed apart from the government be one of the large employer in scotland with major production facility on the outskirt of ayr at the time the digital pension scheme be regard as one of the good in the united kingdom annual increase be discretionary but pension more than keep pace with the good available in digital equipment merge with compaq and in that organisation in turn merge with hewlett packard in hewlett packard split and hewlett packard enterprise take over responsibility for the digital pension scheme employee of digital compaq and hewlett packard join and pay into the pension scheme in the reasonable expectation that future pension benefit which would have provide they with reasonable pension on retirement would continue to increase in line with the cost of living sadly however that have not happen since hewlett packard enterprise take over the pension scheme there have be only three discretionary increase of in in and in hewlett packard enterprise while present itself to its customer and investor as the most ethical company in the world be take advantage of the weakness in the uk pension legislation relate to service that have result in raw deal average pension of which even when top up with the maximum state pension result in low income living as define by the government regardless of its legality this practice be heartless immoral and unethical and it be absolutely unacceptable from major global corporation by contrast hewlett packard enterprise have have an global annual net revenue profit of between billion and billion since total around trillion in hewlett packard chief executive be pay million bonus of almost million and million in stock option shareholder get billion in dividend that year if other far less profitable company can pay increase to their pensioner surely hewlett packard can as well we might ask why it do not the answer be simply that it do not have to in fact it do not even have to explain how it come to the decision that it make each year the decision make process what factor be consider and how pensioner need be represent all lack transparency and there be nothing that compel the company to change that it have make its point for year and there be deadlock be realist although call on the uk government to put pressure on us headquarter corporation that be unlikely to break the deadlock however there be way forward on wednesday october david carson representative of the hewlett packard pension association give oral evidence to the work and pensions committee on the define benefit pension scheme inquiry as be mention by the chair of the committee the hewlett packard pension association also make three write submission which feature in the committee final report the committee mention these oral and write submission in paragraph of the report and paragraph of the conclusion it comment some pension scheme member be dependent on discretionary increase to ensure their pension payment keep up with the cost of living where these have not be award the effect have be over time to erode their standard of living this can be particularly the case for those with right build up before april when there be no general requirement to index link pension in payment the pensions regulator should undertake research to find out how many scheme have provision for discretionary increase on benefit include in their rule whether the discretion be for the trustee sponsor employer or both the number of year in which scheme have pay discretionary increase on right and the number of year in which they have not do so as well as the reason for that as matter of urgency strongly encourage the pensions minister the government and the pensions regulator to complete the research which believe will make it undeniably clear that an ethical code of conduct be require to ensure collaboration between company and trustee on develop policy and strategy for discretionary increase clarification be also need from the government on section of the pensions act that section be insert by paragraph of schedule to the pension schemes act which state the trustee or manager must determine and from time to time review and if necessary revise strategy for ensure that pension and other benefit under the scheme can be provide over the long term that could be central to break the deadlock if discretionary increase be view in the same way as other benefit in pension scheme it follow that company and trustee must work together to devise strategy for ensure that pension and other benefit under scheme can be provide over the long term we also need the research to be do by the dwp and the pensions regulator code of ethical conduct to be develop and clarification from the government that the intent of the pension schemes act be that company and trustee must work together to devise strategy for ensure that pension and other benefit under scheme which include discretionary increase can be provide over the long term appreciate that the minister may not be able to provide clarification on these matter today but would be grateful for write response in due course finally although this debate focus on private pension no debate on pension would be complete without mention the great ever pension injustice the million waspi woman include in my constituency who be not inform by successive government of change to the age at which the state pension would be payable the government have ignore the plight of these woman for nine year the government hop that the waspi woman would go away but they have not although be unfortunately die each year without get any form of compensation some have already tragically pass away include my constituent margaret meikle and morag syne the government must urgently support and progress the private member bill table by my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown the bill have its first reading early this year and it would require the secretary of state to publish proposal for compensation scheme for woman bear between april and april inclusive who have be adversely affect by the increase to the state pension age congratulate the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael on securing and open this debate he have speak passionately about this subject in the house before especially in relation to the bp shell and other oil and gas scheme and about the way that decision be be make because of concern other than the good interest of scheme member admire his knowledge and determination to support those who have be affect by adverse change to their pension scheme my good friend my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty passionately raise the case of his constituent who be allied steel and wire pensioner and he speak of the need for the government to carefully consider the select committee report hope that the minister will meet hon member and their constituent and that he will update hon member who have so doughtily put forward their constituent case work as trade union official in previous life and represent many member in pension dispute so have experience of this area thank the backbench business committee for grant this debate and thank colleague for their valuable and insightful contribution young people be frequently quite rightly advise to start plan for their retirement as early as possible when people make plan for their future they do so in good faith contract be effectively create between employer or state and employee to provide for an income to be pay in later life although it would be naive to think that nothing could change during the intervene decade people make decision about how they will afford their retirement when they enrol in pension scheme the right hon member for orkney and shetland have previously speak in this place about the emotional representation he have receive from people affect by the change to the bp define benefit scheme be sure nobody here could fail to be move by the word of the die bp pensioner who be tell that his widow will no long be protect from inflation despite previous assurance pension be after all not only an income while we be alive they be also way of provide for love one after we be go my lewisham deptford constituency be not so well know for its oil and gas but have constituent who be affect when they contact last year my constituent outline how in practical term bp decision to override the recommendation of its pension fund trustee mean that the pension of some individual in the uk have decline in real term by in just two year for an individual in their on an average pension that cut equate to loss of income of about across their retirement some of the individual affect be in their and and it be not great leap to assume that many may be in poor health and may have face spiral energy cost over the last few year that be just one example of the huge impact that policy change can have on individual let turn to the wide pension landscape there be three type of pension in this country define benefit define contribution and the state pension all have be touch on at various point during this debate we have reach something of critical moment in pension policy the last far reach review of the uk pension system carry out by the pensions commission report in since then the uk have weather global financial crisis pandemic and the high level of inflation for almost year over the same period home ownership rate have fall and there have be big rise in self employment thank to the gig economy in short the way people be or be not save for their retirement have change and we need to determine whether the current pension landscape be still work that be why in november my right hon friend the member for leeds west rachel reeves announce wide range pension review our review will look across the whole sector it will set out proposal to ensure that individual get the good possible return and will identify the barrier to pension fund invest more in uk productive asset perhaps quick review of the track record of labour and the conservatives will provide further evidence of why labour be well place to hold that review under the last labour government pensioner poverty halve million be lift out of poverty so how be thing go under the conservatives on their watch one in five pensioner now live in poverty gas and electricity bill have rocket mortgage and rent have go through the roof and more old people be rent into retirement and increase number of pensioner be rely on their hard earn saving to get by analysis carry out recently by labour have show that the state pension be the main source of income for more than million people woman and single pensioner would pay the heavy price if the tories cut the state pension to fill the billion tax black hole create by their unfunded proposal to cut national insurance that would see the pension cut by week or pensioner pay more in tax that be proof that you can trust the tories with the state pension in the midst of cost of living crisis that be hit pensioner hard the government be fail to ensure that family be get the support that they be entitle to up to eligible pensioner be not claim pension credit when we look at various workplace pension our analysis show that average pension pot be small than they would have be have wage grow at the rate they do under the last labour government worker on average earning can expect to have amass pension pot since however if wage during that period have grow at the rate they do under labour the same worker would have build up pot work people will feel the cost of tory chaos for year to come with the government failure to make work pay wipe thousand of pound off the value of the average pension pot all that be before we get to the government break promise on the triple lock and the billion that the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss wipe off pension fund with her disastrous mini budget we may not represent the same party but hope that the right hon member for orkney and shetland will agree that old people be pay heavy economic price for the mess create by the tories the number of people age over will increase from million to million over the next year we be live long one in four baby bear today will be around to celebrate their birthday yet the centre for ageing better say that financially secure and healthy late life be become increasingly unlikely for million of people labour record on pension be clear we lift million pensioner out of poverty we introduce pension credit boost the income of the poor pensioner disproportionate number of whom be woman as my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms rightly point out we create automatic enrolment which bring million more people into workplace pension and give they level of retirement income they otherwise never would have have when the tories break the triple lock which have be vital in protect pensioner income and provide security we campaign against that under labour the triple lock be safe furthermore we will never put the nation financial stability at risk by play fast and loose with the economy we will tackle the cost of live crisis head on and ensure that individual have the security they deserve in retirement we will give future pensioner the ability to prepare for retirement with confidence by create more well pay job in every part of the country help people get into stay in and get on in work and champion decent second pension for all pensioner along with everyone else in the country need change labour have plan to grow the economy put money back in people pocket make work pay and be the party of pensioner again although it be not within the minister power to call general election perhaps he could have word with someone who can it be pleasure to be here today thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael and the backbench business committee for allow the debate which be second outing on the issue within few month we all agree that occupational pension be crucially important many hard work people across the country depend on their occupational pension for an income in retirement have spend year pay into their pension scheme the right hon member for orkney and shetland speak powerfully once again about the situation that his constituent face and he refer to other as well he speak powerfully about the situation as he see it all of we have constituent who have do the right thing work hard and contribute to their occupational pension scheme so it matter to all of we that they get what they have be promise when it fall due as set out in the rule of the scheme when we last debate the issue in westminster hall in january make the point that would not speak about specific scheme and will not do so today will comment in more general term what comment might make about the generality of the issue should not be take as an oblique commentary on any of the scheme mention in the debate today no matter how tempting that might be for some since the debate in january the world have indeed move on and have try to take some step as well as have be say we publish consultation on option for define benefit scheme in february the consultation reflect new funding landscape where funding level be generally high and many scheme be in surplus the consultation seek feedback on proposal to make surplus extraction easy where it be safe to do so and on the model for future public sector consolidator operate by the pension protection fund the consultation be now close and we be currently analyse the response it close only fortnight ago so we be not quite there yet but there will be government response in due course but can be clear today that well outcome for saver lie at the heart of our proposal stress give the comment we have hear today that the proposal on surplus sharing include range of safeguard as the starting and foundational principle to ensure that member benefit be protect can understand the attraction of such change for government and corporate but impress upon the minister the need to ensure that if change of this sort be to be make then the first protection always have to be for the beneficiary if there be to be flexibility for government and corporate to get investment in big infrastructure project that be to be encourage but it should never be at the expense of the pensioner themselves that be very much the approach that be take with this matter it have be discuss at great length at the sector roundtable that have be present at it have be very strong theme that have hear so can assure the right hon gentleman that be acutely conscious that that be the lens through which be look at the issue my hon friend do say that thing have move on since january may gently remind he that it be in january that he tell the work and pensions committee that he be wait to hear from his official who be in discussion with the cabinet office about the aea technology pension scandal he have since be say that there be no timeline for how these people will be advise of appropriate redress do he expect there to be no timeline between now and the general election or can they expect definite answer at some point before then my right hon friend have pre empte topic that be about to come to because could see that it be go to come up in the discussion on the select committee report have now be to see the cabinet office minister with my official and my official then go back for second visit so although can not give he timeline can say that be motor this issue along as rapidly as can when say that this be complex it be because it be complex it be not merely because that be useful and convenient word to cover multitude of thing we continue to work as fast as we can to try to reach conclusion hear the point that he have make to both in this place and outside about want to draw this to conclusion as good we can the regulation that refer to on the funding and investment strategy clarify what prudent funding plan look like allow open scheme to take account of new member and future accrual make it explicit that there be headroom in the regulatory environment for scheme to invest more productively and require all scheme to be clear about their long term strategy to protect member benefit db funding level have improve in recent year and it be important that scheme take advantage of the opportunity that this bring the scheme funding regulation will help scheme get the most from their asset while at the same time ensure that scheme member can be confident that they will receive the benefit that they be promise the regulation embe good practice and build on the exist funding regime for db scheme by provide clear funding standard which will ensure as far as possible that scheme be properly fund over the long term scheme member can and should be confident that the regulation provide increase security for their promise pension which be important to many of the people whom the right hon member for orkney and shetland be try to support through this debate in addition the new general code for the pensions regulator have come into effect since we last discuss these issue the new general code consolidate and simplify of the exist code to make it easy for trustee and those run occupational pension scheme to find the information they need on the regulator standard of conduct and practice it come into force at the end of march this year will do my good to reply to some of the point that have be raise in the debate before continue with my speech be grateful to the chair of the work and pensions committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms for cover many of the issue in what be very helpful report on db scheme know that we often discuss select committee report in this place on thursday and it be quite right that we should do so normally however we do so after the government have issue their official response to that committee report if the chair of the select committee will forgive will not pre empt every recommendation in the report but can assure he that sit down for marathon session with my official not so long ago go through every last sentence in the report so can tell he that be give the matter full consideration it be worth note that both the right hon member for east ham and the hon member for strangford jim shannon mention the auto enrolment reform be happy to place on the record today our ongoing commitment to consult in the on that issue be keen to make progress hear all across the chamber that there be recognition of why it be important that we make as rapid progress as we can the right hon gentleman mention that he will have to provide consultation he summarise the general tone of the contribution very well certainly there have be more response to that consultation than to any other during my time in the department have read most of they myself rather than just wait for the summary have absorb similar mood music to the right hon member for east ham and hope that we can have proper government response very soon thank the minister for the attention that he be pay to the recommendation in our report on the auto enrolment review recommendation do he envisage the consultation on implementation happen this side of the election no decision have yet be take on when that might be it would be wrong for to speculate at the dispatch box about when it might occur but as say be keen for it to happen as soon as we can manage it the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty rightly raise his constituent and the aws pensioner as he may be aware from the oral evidence give to the work and pensions committee have meet with the pensioner fear this always sound like cliché but listen carefully commission work on the back of that meeting receive that work and review it and then commission some further work on the back of that the policy development process be ongoing be happy to meet the hon gentleman he ask for timeline he actually read out my timeline when he quote my reply to he from april so he answer his own question as say will happily meet with he and the pensioner but caution he that doubt that can say very much more at this stage than have already he may want to consider at what point he wish to have further meeting give that it be long way for they to come from south wales to hear say what already say to they few month ago but be work hard on the issue my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey speak eloquently about the potential value of cdc not least in this place can not wait for the royal mail one to get off the ground welcome her comment on the importance of employer do right by their employee we should always note just how many do that she ask for an update on the pension dashboard as be sure the house know there be reset of the pension dashboard shortly before arrive in the department have take close personal interest in it have oversee few rail infrastructure project in my time that also need bit of reset the chief executive of the money and pensions service oliver morley and be take careful scrupulous and in depth interest in the progress of the reset be satisfied that we be make good progress the timetable for connection have now be issue and we be very much on track the hon member for strangford and for ayr carrick and cumnock allan dorans mention waspi be not sure that there be much that can usefully add right now because do not think that this be the debate for it note the comment that be make and entirely understand they as the hon member for strangford mention there will be debate on waspi in this place very soon as an important part of the engagement with parliament that the ombudsman identify look forward to hear what member have to say will do my good to cover few issue around discretionary increase because it be important to put on record the legal situation there be clear legal requirement for scheme to provide indexation on all define benefit right accrue after and on guarantee minimum pension right accrue between and some pension scheme go beyond the legal requirement and provide more generous indexation if high level of indexation be set out in the scheme rule those level of indexation must be pay the scheme rule set out the pension package that member have the right to receive some scheme provide additional indexation on discretionary basis in some case these payment may have be make regularly in the past but they be not part of the pension package promise by the employer rather they be and remain by definition discretionary understand the frustration that will cause for pension scheme member no long receive such discretionary increase and during previous debate commit to look closely at the situation in order to well understand whether the arrangement that we have in place be work as intend that commitment still stand and recently meet with the pensions regulator to personally discuss the issue along with many of the other concern that be raise in january and indeed some of those raise today have to stress that the legislation do not and can not seek to set out exactly what every scheme must do in each and every circumstance the legislation set out some minimum standard for indexation that do not prevent more generous arrangement which may be bring into scheme through its rule or provide on discretionary basis those arrangement be the concern of the scheme trustee the government set minimum legal requirement which trustee and sponsor employer can exceed if they choose if they judge that scheme can afford it in the short and the long term it be important to achieve balance provide member with some measure of protection against inflation while not increase scheme cost beyond what most scheme can generally afford trustees whether of big firm or small one must have an eye to the future viability of their scheme be very grateful to all member who have contribute to this debate it have be wide range partly because be call pension schemes it cover multitude of issue beyond the more precise one that the right hon member for orkney and shetland raise be grateful to all who have participate and commit to work much hard on this issue in the future because know how important it be to many of our constituent with two minute call alistair carmichael to wind up when contact the speaker office this morning be tell there be only myself and the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms down to speak so be delighted that we have have good debate we have have contribution from no few than members which give what be happen elsewhere today be quite significant number of member make reference to the waspi issue do not do so in the course of my remark because it be not really germane but it be point well make and very much associate myself with it the ombudsman take long enough to get report on that and now we need to get on and honour it otherwise what be the point of have an ombudsman in the first place the function and purpose of debate such as this be to ensure that the concern of our constituent be hear in government the presence of the minister on the front bench be an important symbol of that the company to which reference have be make bp shell exxonmobil hewlett packard and allied steel and wire be some of the well know high street name in the country and hope that what we have hear in this debate will be hear also in the boardroom of those and other company the people who run those company should understand that we be watch what they be do that they have an obligation to treat their former worker and their pensioner fairly and that if they do not have it within themselves to do that we in parliament and in government will make sure that they have to question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider pension scheme on point of order mr deputy speaker understand there be report online of veteran allegedly be prevent from use their veteran id card which be government issue id card for vote today in the election that be take place across the country today be sure that will be of concern to member across the house government minister have apparently make public apology and say that they will try to get the issue resolve wonder whether you have have any notice of an urgent statement next week on the matter it do seem bizarre not least because current military identity card can be use and the card be government issue document declare an interest as holder of one of those veteran card but it do seem very strange and hope we can get some clarity on this from the government have you have any notice of such statement have have no notification from any government minister that there will be statement today as you know at the end of proceeding today we go into the may recess and we will be reassemble on tuesday know that those on the treasury bench will make certain that your comment be make available to ministers in order that there can be response kingsmill massacre inquest motion make and question propose that this house do now morrissey first of all may thank mr speaker and the table office for allow and facilitate this debate it be with sadness but also with determination and commitment that bring this matter to the house have speak to the minister of state who be pleased to see in his place give he my speech beforehand and tell he some of the thing that be ask for with that purpose we try to move forward to address these issue the debate refer to an event that take place year ago the reason it have take so long be that the inquest happen only about two or three week ago although ask for an urgent question on the monday after that be very pleased to have this adjournment debate this date be perhaps poignant one because we understand that the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act have come into effect which should mean the end of the probing of legacy issue however be aware that the police ombudsman for northern ireland have say that her remit be to continue investigate former police officer for further year be not sure why that remit continue because people seek truth and justice include about kingsmill and in other avenue have be tell that the date be pass that be one of the question that have ask the minister and perhaps he could respond to it later it would appear that the vilification of the royal ulster constabulary be to continue with funding available and find that difficult to understand my party and believe all opposition party oppose the act in its entirety include on state body my view be that the government be seek to cease any police ombudsman case be afraid that that question must be answer because there be an anomaly and discrepancy there those who love one at kingsmill and elsewhere must have their question answer the kingsmill massacre live in the annal of history along with the darkley gospel hall attack as the pinnacle of evil intention there be absolutely no doubt about that in my mind or the mind of people outside this chamber who be watch the debate want to give some detail about what take place because think that they will illustrate the evilness of man the massacre take place on january just after pm red ford transit minibus be carry textile worker home from their work along the rural road to bessbrook as the bus clear the rise of hill it be stop by man in combat uniform stand on the road and flash torch the worker assume they be be stop and search by the british army as the bus stop eleven gunman in combat uniform and with blacken face emerge from the hedge man with pronounce english accent perhaps that put the bus driver at ease begin talk he order the worker to get out of the bus and to line up face it with their hand on the roof he then ask who be the catholic in the bus fear that the gunman be loyalist who have come to kill their catholic colleague his workmate try to stop he from identify himself however when hughes step forward the gunman tell he get down the road and do look back the lead gunman then say right and the other immediately open fire on the worker the eleven man be be extremely grateful to the hon gentleman for remind we of just how wicked those event be and for the passion with which he represent his constituent on these issue be clear that those be not the action of soldier in war they be the dishonourable crime of cowardly terrorist it be matter of great regret that they have not express contrition or remorse and that they do not confess to those crime and suffer the justice that they be owe thank the minister for that intervention the eleven man be shoot at very close range with automatic rifle which include armalites it be clear that man be murder because they be protestant that be what it be about interruption total of round be fire in less than minute the man be shoot at waist height and fall to the ground some fall on top of each other either dead or wound when the initial burst of gunfire stop the gunman reload their weapon the order be give to finish they other word no survivor and another burst of gunfire be fire into the heaped body of the workman one of the gunman also walk among the die man and shoot each of they in the head with pistol as they lie on the ground such horror such barbarity such evil ten of the man die at the scene will name those if can they be john bryans year of age robert chambers year of age reginald chapman year of age walter chapman year of age robert freeburn year of age joseph lemmon year of age john mcconville year of age james mcwhirter year of age robert walker year of age and kenneth worton year of age alan black who be only at the time be the only one who survive he have be shoot time and one of the bullet have graze his head he say do even flinch because know if move there would be another one only that time it would not have graze his head but would have kill he after carry out the shooting the gunman calmly walk away shortly after married couple come upon the scene of the killing and begin pray beside the victim those be the undisputed fact of the case however what the inquiry have find be what be first suggest by the historical enquiries team investigation in that although the ira be supposedly on ceasefire at the time it be in fact the provisional ira that carry out the atrocity the coroner say in his finding the attack be carry out by the ira operate under the authority of the army council which have in april give wide authorisation to ira unit it be sanction at the high level by ira terrorist scumbag however the coroner fail to name the three know ira terrorist individual who carry out the killing who be now decease themselves he should have do so it be common knowledge but for the purpose of the coroner report they should have be name think it be important that that be put on record he fail to name and shame at least three know individual now themselves decease those name be available in various medium outlet include the bbc eleven automatic weapon be use to kill those protestant workman those weapon be link to other serious republican terrorist crime over year period include the murder of two paratrooper in and the killing of chief superintendent harry breen and superintendent bob buchanan in the coroner report far find that the organisation of the attack be plan well in advance in the republic of ireland have speak to the minister of state and he know that be go to ask about this the excuse within the finding that the gardaí be not ask for information that they hold at the time be completely untenable it far make mockery of the current legal proceeding and the government legacy legislation that this clear evidence of the gardaí unwillingness to help with investigation then and now be so blatant what police organisation would say you do ask we for the information so therefore we not give it to you police organisation in this case the garda síochána should have work alongside the royal ulster constabulary and ensure that all the evidence they have be make available but it clearly be not there be question to ask in relation to that the other thing that concern greatly this be the second part of the question that the kingsmill family be ask be that the coroner refuse to disclose information contain in secret file provide to he by the security force in closed hearing the three people who carry out the attack have on the run certificate give to they so that they could get away with their past crime it grieve greatly to have to record the heartache and pain that those family feel because some of those people have get off why and how could that be the case there be another point want to raise with the minister and it be really important to do so simply because there be just so many question to be ask the finding omit any discourse on the perpetrator when it be say in south armagh at the time that the dog on the street know who have carry out this atrocity the kingsmill massacre with the murder of innocent protestant people indeed it be widely hold that the perpetrator carry on the run letter some elect member have publicly joke can think of one in particular who joke with loaf of kingsmill bread on the anniversary the family do not laugh they carry the pain some of the family wonder why the investigation of this massacre have receive nothing like the result of other investigation that have result in prosecution make the point to the minister of state whom speak to beforehand why be it that this be plan in the republic of ireland and be carry out from the jurisdiction of the republic of ireland and those people be able to cross the border with impunity and then the garda síochána do not seem to do anything about it the minister of state will know my own personal case and indeed everyone in this house probably know it my cousin kenneth be murder by the ira as well order if the hon member wish to take the time to compose himself be quite happy to wait for he to do so there be no pressure on he whatsoever know how emotional this be for he and indeed for the house so be quite happy for he to compose himself thank you mr deputy speaker my cousin kenneth smyth be murder by the ira on december use that as comparison because it be true and the three people who kill he escape across the border in the same way as the ira of they who kill the protestants at kingsmill there be question to be answer and there be debt of justice be believer as you know mr deputy speaker and believe that people in the next world will have their justice and we will have justice however would like to see justice happen for the family in this world and that be what wish to see on behalf of the kingsmill family want the answer to the question why be the garda síochána not forthcoming on the murder of the two police constable about which my party have certainly ask question in the past we want justice for they as well have hear the cry for public inquest and it be very clear from what people be say that they want to see that think it be right very right that the request should be forthcoming yet it appear that the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act will halt this however as indicate at the start of this all too brief contribution the police ombudsman have highlight that her role have be permit to carry on for further year so why be the kingsmill massacre family preclude response to the coroner report which be go to quote in its entirety state it be for the reason outline above that alan who be the survivor the kingsmills family and other have call on the secretary of state in this case it be the minister of state who be answer on his behalf to announce full independent public inquiry into the kingsmills massacre we would like to have the support of our public representative believe that the coroner finding have reaffirm that call it be what we have all know for year and there be many people in the province who seek justice our family seek justice and the kingsmill massacre family seek justice there have to be day of reckoning and would certainly like to see that day of reckoning happen in this world the coroner finding reaffirm what we have all know for many year but that be all and the family be ask for more ask this of the minister of state with great gentleness but firmness he will not mind my do so and in way that hope underline that the kingsmill massacre family deserve more very humbly ask today for that inquiry and for that justice with public inquiry and with those question answer for they thank you very much be glad to respond to today debate on subject that be as ever as we have see very painful and difficult the government recognise that as my hon friend the member for strangford jim shannon have show the victim be people who feel they be people who grieve and as my hon friend he be my hon friend have vividly illustrate the scar run deep and the pain that people suffer even today be very great and vivid we certainly recognise that people want fact and they want justice be extremely grateful to my hon friend for give people voice today he have do it with great skill authenticity and passion it be worth say if he will allow hope he will forgive that he be strong and courageous man know that and myself feel that reflect some of the passion that he do even though can never quite feel it live through the trouble as boy and as young royal air force officer in the since be on fast jet be never post to northern ireland but do have to check under my car every time get in it in the people be shoot dead people who perhaps look like because we have short hair and look military have not suffer loss as my hon friend have and any of we who have any reason to consider the trouble and what they mean must in great humility acknowledge the suffering of those who lose those they love indeed we have to acknowledge the contribution of those who serve to defend we from great evil about which he have elaborate hope that today will be able to answer my hon friend question and be extremely grateful for advance sight of his remark believe will be able to satisfy he in at least some regard and if be not able to will be glad to meet he and discuss matter far come first to the finding of the inquest the kingsmill murder in which the provisional ira shoot dead protestant workman and leave one severely injure be an appalling example of the pain and suffering inflict on civilian during the trouble we must never forget that it be the civilian population who suffer most in term of life lose from that period of violence with close to people kill the victim and family of kingsmill include the sole survivor of the attack mr alan black have fight for many decade to get information and accountability from those responsible the coroner for the inquest deliver clear and detailed finding include that kingsmill be horrific and overtly sectarian atrocity commit by the ira under the authority of the army council and the attack have absolutely no justification that the attack have be plan well in advance and an attack of such scale require significant amount of planning that the attack occur in the aftermath of and ostensibly as response to the reavey and murder but the reality be that it have be plan long before they take place the coroner also say that the rumour concern the involvement of captain robert nairac in the kingsmill attack be entirely false and would like to quote from the judicial communications office the coroner be entirely satisfied that captain nairac have no role whatsoever in the kingsmill atrocity he say captain robert nairac be highly decorate soldier and his memory be ill serve by those who persist in rumour monger concern his involvement in kingsmill moreover the false accusation serve to distract from the proper attribution of responsibility for those who carry out the attack rumour concern the involvement of captain robert nairac in the kingsmill attack be entirely false the coroner also say that the attack be at least in part plan in ireland the border between northern ireland and ireland be exploit by terrorist and allow for planning training organisation weapon storage and retreat at safe physical and legal distance from the authority that would be face with investigate terrorist act in northern ireland despite these finding acknowledge with regret that there will be some unanswered question for the family that be unfortunately often the case in what be complex sensitive and decade old trouble relate case one key reason why such question remain unanswered in this case be what the coroner describe as the absence of any disclosure or evidence from those who cause the death the coroner say that the inquest do not receive disclosure from any individual concern in the attack nor their organisation nor their political representative in fact numerous call to assist the inquest be meet with silence as result despite the savagery of the attack the coroner find that there have be no acknowledgement by the ira of the utter wrongness of the atrocity its impact on those bereaved or the damage cause to the entire community as we look forward to an amazing period of opportunity for northern ireland ahead of we with the executive restore and perform extremely well there be great role to be play as we move towards reconciliation by people who have the opportunity to express contrition and remorse it be extremely difficult to forgive someone who claim that their action be necessary and that they be soldier in war they be not they commit act of terrorism as this incident clearly illustrate encourage everyone involve to express contrition and remorse to seek forgiveness and to help northern ireland to move on that be in everyone interest whatever their view on the constitutional question the hon gentleman ask about the police ombudsman for northern ireland and letter of comfort to address his point about the ombudsman work will provide clarification on what investigative body can still deliver section of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act specifically prohibit the commencement or continuation of any trouble relate criminal investigation from may apart from those that will be conduct by the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery that remain the case for all investigative body include the police ombudsman for northern ireland in the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act commencement no and transitional provisions regulations which we lay yesterday we include transitional provision to clarify that in case where an investigation have be complete prior to yesterday may and only final administrative task remain outstanding which may include activity such as report writing family engagement or publication they may be retain and complete by their original owner but no further investigative work may now be do except by the icrir in relation to trouble era offence and that include the ombudsman the transitional provision apply to any body that have such outstanding final administrative task on may include operation kenova the police service of northern ireland and the police ombudsman for northern ireland the issue for the family be that they be aware that the garda síochána have information pertinent to this atrocity this massacre of innocent the question that they be ask and that be ask as member of parliament which hope the minister of state can respond to be about evidence not available before that be available now it could have determine impact on decision know also ask on behalf of the family for public inquiry but if all the information and evidence that should have be available but be not be available now it could put different stain or paint different colour on what happen it could lead to those who be responsible be hold accountable believe will be able to cover all those point that the hon gentleman have raise as go through my remark hope you will not mind my saying mr deputy speaker that we be not short of time it be worth for the hon gentleman and those watch my give proper answer hope to do that and will certainly take further intervention from he as we go on in relation to alleged on the run letter in the hand of perpetrator the then secretary of state for northern ireland my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers set out the government position on the on the run scheme fully in her statement to the house of commons on september that follow detailed consideration of the report by lady justice hallett which be publish in july in her statement the then secretary of state be clear that the on the run scheme be at an end and there be no basis for any reliance on letter receive by so call on the run under the scheme during legislative passage of the legacy act the government again confirm that position do not know who do or do not receive on the run letter will come on to that matter in moment but it will now be an operational matter for the icrir to consider it be not something on which can elaborate far will the minister give way will but will talk about the icrir straight away if the responsibility fall on that body be it in order to ask it to clarify the matter of the on the run letter that be clearly not do in the coroner report but the family indicate clearly that it do have they would be grateful if family make reference to the icrir later shall publish link to its website which speak about investigation have have good look at the website in prepare for the debate will come on to that and will send that link to my hon friend so that he can share it with people yes people should certainly make reference and hope that the icrir will feel able to satisfy they but he will know that it be independent of ministers so that be not matter for but for the commission believe that members of the house will share the government disappointment that the inqu could not obtain the co operation it desire from those implicate in or with knowledge about the atrocity and who may have be able to provide additional information for the family involve the government have long recognise that truly effective information recovery require the co operation of the various different actor during the trouble that be exactly why the new independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery be support by both legislative requirement for full disclosure by the state and by power to compel witness to provide evidence be pleased that the icrir commence its function on may as expect those power mean that the independent commission will have the tool that it need to obtain as much information as possible for individual and family in fact the northern ireland high court recently find that the disclosure power hold by the commission be not only compliant with the state international obligation but could improve on current inquest mechanism individual suspect of hold information that might be pertinent to review by the commission will now be require to co operate with the commission or risk significant sanction refusal to comply with notice of disclosure by the commission be subject to penalty notice of up to turn to remark by peter sheridan the commissioner for investigation in an article release by pa media title chance of prosecution from new legacy body vanishingly small mr sheridan say have hear across the board about how justice stop on the first of may actually if people read the information the opposite be true as the commissioner for investigation have the ability to do criminal justice style investigation and report to the prosecution service either in england and wales or here in northern ireland where we find evidence available he far say want to be absolutely honest with victim and survivor on what be vanishingly small possibility around criminal justice prosecution not that there be still hope there could be evidence available that be enough to prosecute but he also explain if you take kenova million eight year work and no prosecution so we have to be honest with people of what achievable about case that be year old that be the situation we face and that be why we have institute the commission it will have the opportunity to engage in culpability investigation my hon friend and the family be keen for people to be name culpability investigation be describe on the website understand my hon friend concern regard the naming of individual it be important to note that there should be consideration of many issue and judgment make include about the safety of life such consideration will remain relevant as the process move forward the icrir will seek to establish all the circumstance of the death or other harmful conduct use its full range of statutory power include the ability to compel witness the commission will at the conclusion of its review write final report it will make finding on the balance of probability on issue such as who and what be to blame importantly it will answer specific question ask by family where that be possible however the content of report be an operational matter for the icrir it be independent of ministers as be right and proper be confident that many people out there would not believe minister so it be important that the icrir be independent encourage people to look at the website and will tweet the link later hope that the hon gentleman will feel able to share it with family turn to the irish government one of the coroner other key finding the exploitation of the border in the planning execution or aftermath of criminal activity not just in this case but throughout the entirety of the trouble be well establish as the hon gentleman indicate as he will know well there be many trouble relate case in which criminal activity be suspect to have take place across jurisdiction for individual and family who be the victim of such case effective information recovery will require the provision of information by the irish authority one such case be the omagh bombing the uk government continue to press the irish government to co operate fully with the inquiry on that and if necessary to establish similar process in ireland to facilitate the full provision of answer for the family affect repeat that invitation to the irish government today they be very welcome to establish process for co operation with the commission to the end that the hon gentleman mention where they have information that could help with information discovery and reconciliation encourage they to work with the commission to date the irish government have decline to commit to co operate with the commission to facilitate the provision of information to family who request it the recent northern ireland high court judgment find the commission to be operationally independent from government and capable of conduct review in accordance with the state obligation under article and of the european convention on human right we hope that that will lead to further engagement by the irish government with the commission the approach take by the irish government to co operate with the kingsmill inquest the coroner express gratitude for the co operation of the irish authority should act as useful template for future co operation with both the omagh bombing inquiry and the icrir would like to put on record that the relationship between the uk government and the irish government be today one of robust friendship we be friend and partner not rival or opponent we be go forward together in spirit of constructive co operation on wide range of matter be proud to have play some part in make that possible this would be great time for our two nation to co operate in detail on issue of the past to help lay to rest various suspicion or expose wrongdoing and so make progress thank the minister for that positive outlook bring this adjournment debate on behalf of the family who lose love one and the survivor alan black could the minister answer and the correspondence be convey to the taoiseach down south and the necessary minister there with the message that we seek justice for the kingsmill massacre family to ensure that after year their case be answer would be astonish if the irish government be not follow this debate live we have friend in the embassy of ireland and in the government of ireland whom we respect and with whom we wish to continue to develop friendship and co operation the relationship between the uk and ireland be fundamental for too long we fail to look west but we should have do as be often say one of the problem we face be that the irish never forget the history and the english never remember we need to make the effort to remember and to go forward as friend in spirit of co operation it be precisely because we respect ireland and its status as an independent nation make its own choice that we can really only plead encourage and invite it to join we in work with the icrir the hon gentleman make the case on why an garda síochána be not forthcoming will just say that that will have be hear by the irish government and think he make powerful case for further co operation the garda will have record that may assist in answer the kind of question that he raise it be in their interest to defend their excellent reputation in the interest of defend themselves the record should be share certainly wish to offer no criticism in closing express my sincere hope that the conclusion of the long run kingsmill inquest will bring some form of comfort to the family affect where question remain urge the family seek answer to make use of the power of the new commission the icrir be lead by sir declan morgan kc and staff by dedicated individual experience in work on legacy and reconciliation issue and the government have full confidence in its ability to deliver for victim and survivor include those affect by the awful appalling and unjustifiable action of the ira at kingsmill in january question put and agree to house adjourn
