always matter for the home office but be sure there will be discussion about the issue raise by the hon gentleman school support staff vacancies trends what recent assessment she have make of trend in the number of support staff vacancy in school support staff play vital role in our school we have give school the freedom to recruit the staff they require to meet their own need although we do not collect central datum on vacancy as result can tell the hon lady that the number of support staff work in school have increase for the past three year we have already hear in this question time about delay in get the education health and care plan in lancashire as consequence rural school like quernmore which have the privilege of visit on friday be leave with more child with special educational need in mainstream but without the financial support package that should come with that these small rural school be therefore have to support child with additional need and do not always have the right number of staff to be able to do so in the way they would like be support available to rural and small school especially in lancashire to meet the need of all child we must meet the need of all child and at some level every teacher be teacher of special educational need and disability recognise that there can be particular difficulty for small school in rural area as the hon member mention we have the wide ehcp system which be well than the previous system on place available in special school where child be in mainstream school recognise the central role play by teach assistant that be why we have set out in the send and alternative provision improvement plan how we will look to consolidate that position and give further advice on the good deployment of ta teacher workload what step she be take to help reduce the workload of teacher reduce unnecessary workload be priority for the department and for we have convene workload reduction taskforce of expert teach union and practitioner to make recommendation on how to minimise workload for teacher and school leader it be good to see you back mr speaker and look so well the last minute nature of ofsted inspection be cause huge anxiety to my small rural school in meon valley that mean that teacher and in particular headteacher be put off activity such as residential school trip educational trip and professional development course in case they get that call from ofsted will my right hon friend consider change the notice period for inspection so that teacher can plan their workload well value all those activity that my hon friend set out that school undertake for their child like she represent rural constituency indeed we have next door constituency recognise what she say about small rural school inspection have an important role to play but ofsted also have the flexibility in the framework to take account of the particular position of small school teacher workload be be exacerbate by teacher vacancy that school be struggle to fill and funding pressure be result in cut to support staff who often support the most vulnerable and needy child that be lead to an exodus of teacher from our school just last week we see the staggering figure from the government that teacher train recruitment target have be miss by whopping in our secondary school with the sharp fall in math which be allegedly priority for the prime minister how bad do it have to get before the government will produce and implement proper workforce strategy can confirm that there be more teacher and more teaching assistant in our school compare with we have the most talented generation of teacher ever and we continue to focus on strong recruitment and retention strategy so that we continue to get the good talent to teach our child call the scottish national party spokesperson the workload and stress level of teacher rise exponentially during an inspection be sure that the minister will join in offer condolence to the friend and family of ruth perry in the light of the coroner verdict that the rude and intimidate nature of the ofsted inspection contribute to ruth perry tragic suicide how be the minister ensure the welfare of school leader be prioritise during inspection of course extend my condolence to the friend and family of ruth perry it be the most awful tragedy my right hon friend the secretary of state will say word on that tragedy and ofsted in moment for now let just say that of course the inspection framework and process must both be fully informative to parent and supportive to teacher and school free school meals impact on children and parent what recent assessment her department have make of the impact of free school meal on child and their parent free school meal support disadvantaged family to the value of year ensure that eligible pupil receive healthy nutritious meal the government have expand free school meal more than any other in recent decade now more than third of pupil in england receive they compare with sixth in recently we have have high food inflation while welcome the fact that the government have now halve inflation one of my small school have tell that it be unable to provide free meal within the money allocate as it can not benefit from the same economy of scale as large school will my right hon friend review the fund available for small school acknowledge my hon friend point the national funding formula recognise that some school be necessarily small and do not have the same opportunity to realise economy of scale every school receive lump sum irrespective of its for next year and the government have reform the sparsity factor increase funding for that from million in to million in high education institutions international students what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of trend in the level of university application from international student on the long term sustainability of high education institution be pleased that we have surpass our target with well over international student they remain an important source of income and source of pride for our university and the total impact of international student be worth billion across the duration of their study as the minister have just mention the economic benefit of overseas student be some billion spread between university and economy across the uk but application in this ucas admission round be down with increasingly stiff competition from elsewhere uk institution can not simply rely on their excellent reputation so what more can the minister do to ensure that the uk remain an attractive place for international student to study as say to the hon lady we have something like international student and our target be report december vol we be work very closely with sir steve smith we want to diversify to whole range of different country to advertise ourselves to international student but as say the trend be good the hundred of thousand of international student who be here benefit our economy and provide an important source of income for university call the shadow minister matt western it be great to see you mr speaker as well as contribute to britain world lead research the financial contribution of international student be vital to uk university particularly at time of rise cost pressure and real term fee value erosion any sudden change in the number of international student come to the uk obviously put the high education sector at risk the minister speak of his pride but would like to stress the point and ensure that he put this on record can he absolutely give his assurance to the house that the government remain robust in their ambition to continue to attract international student year as lay out in the international education strategy welcome the hon gentleman question be absolutely committed to the target of as say in response to the previous question we have surpass that with well over report december vol as say they be of benefit to our university and our economy and they be very important source of income for all our high education institution violence in classrooms what recent assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of trend in the level of violence in classroom of course no one should face violence in school in england we have take decisive action to improve pupil behaviour through strengthen the behaviour in school guidance and invest in give support and propagate good practice through the behaviour hub the late pisa figure which be release in the last few week show stark picture of violence in school across the whole uk nowhere else in the oecd do rate of violence reach anywhere near the level in the uk pupil be almost twice as likely as the oecd average to witness fight in their in england and in scotland and as teacher can say from experience that violence in school disrupt every part of pupil learning exclusion clearly be not work and the scottish government recently announce proposal in scotland be to put all the responsibility on teacher what more can the government do to illustrate way forward for school to deal with this problem so that young people learning be not hamper by violence in the classroom for completeness we ought to note that the pisa study note that the great majority of pupil in england report feel safe in school very similar to the oecd average and be less likely than the oecd average to see the most serious manifestation of such behaviour such as see gang at school or see somebody with weapon it be absolutely true that school must have the full range of measure at their disposal there be no right level of exclusion and it should not be use lightly but it have to be there it have to be available early in our time in government we make it clear that teacher can use reasonable force we also extend search power remove the requirement to give parent hour write notice for after school detention and simplify advice on how to prevent and tackle bullying because safe and ordered environment be essential for both child education and their general wellbeing topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility ruth perry death be tragedy that leave hole in the heart of her family her community and her school throughout this year have be honour to work closely with ruth sister julia and her friend lisa and edmund to introduce important change to inspection practice alongside ofsted which ensure that headteacher can share their inspection outcome include with colleague friend and family our new change mean that if school be grade inadequate due to ineffective safeguarding but all other judgment be good it will be reinspecte within three month that have now happen at caversham primary school which be regrade as good this summer we also double the wellbeing support for our school leader in life ruth dedicate herself to her school and we will build on her legacy to help ensure that such tragedy never happen again thank my right hon friend for her statement agree with those sentiment this conservative government will fund new school to

ground next year for the new school will she meet to discuss this urgent matter far our school rebuilding programme be transform school across england and be delighted that tipton st john primary school be one of they the school be currently in flood zone and be impact by the recent storm we be work actively with the diocese of exeter and devon local authority to identify suitable site for the school be happy to agree to meet my hon friend very soon call the shadow secretary of state may start by again send my condolence and those of the entire labour party to the family of ruth perry we must all now listen and learn to deliver an inspection system that work in the good interest of child school staff and community the education secretary have say that her government be do everything to get child into school yet this term the attendance rate have decline consistently hit terrible new low in the late figure be not the real truth simply that the government see attendance as problem affect other people child absolutely not attendance be my no priority regularly meet and chair the attendance action alliance group and we be determined to help ensure that child be in school because that be where they can get the good education we be work with gps and other medical professional to ensure that everybody be aware that first school be good place to be actually well place to be for those with mild anxiety and secondly we be there to give support in school and we want everybody to be in school those effort be start to pay off we now have few child miss school but it be very much at the top of my agenda if it be the secretary of state no priority why be she not legislate for register of child not in school that measure have wide support right across this house but it be miss from the king speech despite the secretary of state repeat promise to legislate despite it have be in the government abandon schools bill and despite it be in her department submission accord to the permanent secretary at the department will the secretary of state confirm as the permanent secretary suggest that it be block by no no absolutely not of course more thing go into king speeches than

resource to good support pupil in that regard thank my hon friend for raise this important issue we know that school base provision work well when all staff be clear about how to support mental health which be why we be provide senior mental health lead training grant to all state school of which have claim grant so far we be also work with the department of health and social care to extend mental health support team to cover at least of pupil by spring call the scottish national party spokesperson if there be to be hope for peaceful solution in the israel gaza conflict the input of palestinian academic will be crucial but many have already lose of their life could the minister make statement about representation that he have make to cabinet colleague about introduce an emergency humanitarian visa for academic in gaza will write to the hon lady about that parental choice be crucial be it not to that end when will wave of the free school programme open my right hon friend and

and standard high order may ask everyone to help out in future please some may not realise that topical question be mean to be speedy so that all member can be accommodate israel hamas war diplomacy urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make statement on the international diplomacy surround the israel hamas war thank the right hon gentleman for his question the government be undertake extensive and global diplomatic engagement to get much great aid into gaza support british national and the safe return of hostage and prevent dangerous regional escalation day after hamas brutal attack the then foreign secretary be in israel to see for himself the devastation work by this heinous act of terrorism and his successor visit in late november to continue dialogue with israeli leader last week the prime minister discuss the late effort to free hostage with prime minister netanyahu and stress the need to take great care to protect civilian in gaza two day later the foreign secretary discuss the future of the middle east peace process with the us secretary of state in washington the situation in gaza can not continue and we be deploy all our diplomatic resource include in the united nations to help to find viable solution the scale of civilian death and displacement in gaza be shocking although israel have the right to defend itself against terror restore its security and bring the hostage home it must abide by international law and take all possible measure to protect civilian we have call for far and long humanitarian pause it be imperative that we increase the flow of aid into gaza but as we have say at the un call for ceasefire ignore the fact that hamas have commit act of terror and continue to hold civilian hostage we remain committed to make progress towards two state solution britain long stand position on the middle east peace process be clear we support negotiate settlement lead to safe and secure israel live alongside viable and sovereign palestinian state know that you continue with your good endeavour mr speaker but when it come to matter as important as this think we see why it be so problematic that the foreign secretary be not in this house the scale of death and destruction see in gaza over the last two month have be intolerable the child leave under the rubble the family displace from their home and the many innocent palestinians face the threat of starvation and disease despite international pressure on israel to change the way it be fight to not replicate the kind of devastating tactic that it use in the north to protect school and hospital and to ensure that humanitarian aid be ramp up labour share grave concern that those condition be not be meet diplomacy not bomb and bullet be the only route to last peace the grave warning from the united nations can not be ignore and they show the urgent need for action to relieve the suffering it be right that the un security council have be debate this war but it constitute failure that it have be unable to reach consensus and to speak with collective voice labour want resolution to pass the un security council resolution that properly condemn hamas terrorist and the appalling october attack on israel and call for the release of all hostage resolution that demand renew cessation of hostility and the protection of palestinian civilian resolution that act as stepping stone towards an endure end to this war we can not give up too much be at stake can the minister explain what step he will now take to help reach that consensus can he update the house on any progress to open up the second crossing at kerem shalom international diplomacy must focus on gaza but it must also focus on further escalation in the west bank and the wide region include lebanon will the government therefore increase pressure on the israeli government in the west bank by impose travel ban on illegal settler involve in attack serious criminal activity and the fostering of hatred will he say unequivocally like labour that we will not tolerate the expulsion of the people of gaza or the west bank and that they must be able to return to their home finally will the minister and the government back labour call for joint western and arab lead international contact group to replace the defunct quartet thank the right hon gentleman for his question recognise the enormous authority that lord cameron hold in these matter and the right hon gentleman request that he should be available in the house will do my good to satisfy he on the question that he have ask as he know lord cameron be keen to engage with the house of commons in every possible way the right hon gentleman ask why britain do not support the un security council resolution can tell he clearly that there be lot good stuff in the resolution that britain do support but there be no condemnation of hamas and for that reason we feel unable to support it however we do not oppose it because it have lot of useful and important stuff in it and we therefore abstain he will recall that there have be number of resolution we vote yes to the un resolution draft by the americans but that be veto by china and russia apparently because they could not bring themselves to condemn what hamas have do on october the right hon gentleman ask about settler violence the targeted killing of civilian be completely abhorrent and we be seek that those responsible should be not just arrest but prosecute and punish on his comment about travel ban can tell he that planning be go on the foreign secretary discuss this with his us counterpart last week and hope it may be possible to say something about that shortly the right hon gentleman also ask about kerem shalom think that the position of kerem shalom be be enhance at the moment and hope very much that that will lead to some facilitation but those discussion be ongoing at this time be sure that the minister will want to condemn the gratuitous sign of antisemitism that we see on the street again this weekend which lead to karen pollock from the holocaust educational trust describe london as no go zone for jewish people know that he will want to condemn that on the broad issue of negotiate ceasefire will he confirm that the government position be as it have be throughout namely that hamas can play no role in the future of the governance of gaza and that it be hamas who be responsible for what be happen in gaza today very much agree with what my hon friend have say on his point about ceasefire at the moment ceasefire be wholly implausible first of all hamas would not agree to one they have make it absolutely clear that they want to replicate the terrible act that take place on october so fear that that be not go to happen that be why we call for extended humanitarian pause and as understand it that remain the position of his majesty official opposition call the snp spokesperson humanitarian aid agency be now repeatedly warn in strong and unmistakable term that they simply can not fulfil their mandate in gaza the united nations relief and works agency have say that gaza be hell on earth over million palestinians now need food assistance what the hell be the uk government do allow people to starve to death when they could do something about it what in god name make they think it be acceptable to stand by as more than people be injure and the hospital that would have treat they be be bomb and starve of supply when they could have an influence over that how on earth have we reach time when people have be slaughter in gaza by government say so and still they be not call for ceasefire do they know that thousand of people in the uk be now scream in horror at their tv screen because they just can not believe what they be witness in gaza and that they be stun by the uk response which be to say that israel have the right to defend itself all country have the right to defend themselves but how can kill the former glasgow university student dima alhaj and her six month old baby ever be describe as self defence why do the uk abstain on the un resolution call for ceasefire the former home secretary call that disappointing call it shameful recognise the passion with which the hon lady speak but have explain in some detail why the government feel it be not possible to support the resolution we do not oppose it we abstain urge the hon lady to think again as ceasefire be wholly implausible it be much more sensible to try to get these humanitarian pause where we have see some success we urgently need to see more for the reason she set out so eloquently the prime minister have repeatedly express his unequivocal support for israel right to defend itself may urge the government to maintain that position to stay the course and to ensure that we continue to give israel our strong support my right hon friend be absolutely right we have make it clear that israel have every right to defend itself but that it must abide by international humanitarian law and the law of war it be wrong and illegal to target civilian international law be very clear that there must be the targeting of civilian those be not my word but the word of the new foreign secretary and then prime minister during the war in gaza give that over palestinian child alone have be kill can the minister confirm whether the foreign secretary and therefore this conservative government still believe that israel target of civilian be wrong and illegal what step be he take to hold the israeli government to account again recognise the integrity with which the hon gentleman speak can tell he that no the israeli government never target civilian but they be pursue strategy of degrade and eliminate the appalling perpetrator and the military machine that work the terrible disaster that take place on october which remind he be pogrom more jewish people be kill on that day than on any single day since the holocaust in even if the foreign secretary be at the dispatch box today doubt if he would do well job than my right hon friend can he say whether the government have make any estimate of the number of hamas fighter who have be kill we seem to get very precise estimate of the number of civilian who have be kill but clearly large number of hamas fighter be engage in oppose israeli force on the ground be any other people other than hamas fighter resist israeli force on the ground thank my right hon friend for his kind personal remark truth be often the first casualty in war and none of the figure that we be hear can be rely upon word now fail to describe the despondency feel by those of we who stand for peace when say we do not just mean those of palestinian descent also mean people in israel who have fight for peace over many year the only way to have last peace peace without fear be to have two state so will repeat the question that put last time what be this government do later today will table bill to recognise palestine will the minister meet to discuss it how do we prevent this from happen ever again will of course be very pleased to meet the hon lady we have previously discuss the content of the bill in another situation but will be very pleased to meet she we be develop proposal the hon lady specifically ask what we be do and obviously we be try to lift people eye to the political track that will at some point be possible we be look in detail at develop proposal for support for the palestinian authority to build up the sinew of statehood in pursuit of the establish policy of both the major political party in this house that there should be two state solution with israel live behind secure border and palestine as free and independent state the minister do say that too many palestinians have die in pursuit of solution to the hamas problem but wonder do he genuinely believe and be it the government position that military solution military defeat of hamas be possible have no doubt that it be possible to degrade and stop the military machine that work the terrible disaster on october when address an ideology however it be extremely important to recognise that political process be absolutely essential that be why the government be spend along with our ally enormous amount of time in try to work through how that could be achieve shamefully our government refuse to back the ceasefire at the un security council last week when motion be support by country include france spain and portugal among other european nation in the face of the indiscriminate killing and suffering that we be see day after day in gaza be it not failure of moral leadership to refuse to back ceasefire will this constant refusal to back ceasefire not be see as give the green light to israel to commit yet more war crime think the hon gentleman would receive the same response from those on his own front bench as he will receive from as have already say to the house ceasefire be simply impractical because we have to have two side that be willing to sign up to ceasefire and there be absolutely no suggestion at any point that either of they will minister in the iranian government general ezzatollah zarghami formerly of the islamic revolutionary guard corps have tell iranian medium that this first mission as the production manager of iranian make rocket be to supply those rocket to be fire into israel and hit civilian he openly tell iranian medium that he live in hamas terror tunnel for some time that be an iranian minister openly admit to have live in terrorist tunnel and supply rocket do my right hon friend share my concern about iran bankroll and arm hamas yes share that concern very much as do the government on illegal settlement do not the experience of the past two decade show that word have absolutely no impact on prime minister netanyahu welcome the minister announcement today that the government be examine sanction the violent illegal settler follow in america footstep but why can we not have ban on all trade between the united kingdom and the illegal settlement the government have always make it absolutely clear that the settlement be illegal under international law and we will continue to make that case as forcefully as we think appropriate agree with the deputy secretary of state comment on degrade hamas but do he agree that the malevolent force in the region be iran although obviously we do not want direct conflict with iran what more can the government do with our partner and ally to ensure that we can degrade the capacity and capability of iran to inflict the suffering that it have inflict on the region my right hon friend will know that the government have be clear that measure need to be take and we have use our own military asset in this respect to make sure that the conflict do not widen we have send very clear warning to iran in that respect along with our ally and he may rest assure that we continue to watch this issue with extreme care in response to an early question the minister talk of dangerous regional escalation and the scale of the loss of life how do his government hope to prevent either and support just and last peace without call for ceasefire how can they claim to support two state solution when they do not recognise the state of palestine one plus zero have never equal two it be think the policy of both side of the house that we should not pursue the possibility of ceasefire because there be no possibility for very trenchant reason that have be set out the hon lady be however right to point to the political horizon to ensure that we take advantage as soon as the moment be plausible of build political track as part of that we be look to build palestinian state capacity we know that gaza should be under palestinian control when this be over hamas have no place in future of gaza and we must never allow they ever to be able to entrench themselves in the civilian population again refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests what recent engagement have my right hon friend have with qatari counterpart in relation to their pivotal role as mediator between israel and hamas discussion with qatari go on all the time indeed my noble friend lord ahmad the foreign office minister with responsibility for the middle east have be in qatar recently the minister will have see picture of the horrific loss of life in gaza which start up again over the weekend and of half naked man be parade through the street the geneva convention prohibit turn prisoner of war into object of public curiosity he will also know of the grave concern about report of the use of rape by hamas fighter on october all of this show that we will need very clear mechanism for the investigation of allegation of war crime and for accountability if war crime be find to have happen will the minister set out what the uk government who have say that international law must be uphold believe that mechanism should be have great deal of sympathy with the point that the hon lady make the british government have make it clear that all party in this terrible conflict must abide by international humanitarian law we continue to identify and look for mechanism for ensure that there can be no impunity in that respect and that there will be transparency over the action that the force take it be good to see you back in the chair mr speaker the humanitarian pause give an opportunity for the welcome release of israeli hostage however as result of palestinian prisoner be release there be concern that hamas be gain ground in the west bank and could end up be the major force in the whole of the area that we call palestine what effort be my right hon friend make to ensure the release of the hostage without any condition my hon friend be absolutely right to focus on the terrible plight of the hostage can not give the house run commentary on what be happen in respect of the hostage but there have be no new development he will know that the ministry of defence be supply surveillance flight over gaza to assist in that general endeavour but he may rest assure that the plight of the hostage be at the top of our list of concern the israeli defence ministry have tell the un that it must do well at deliver aid to gaza this be not natural disaster it be deliberate military action during which israeli force have so far kill un aid staff mostly alongside their family how many more innocent people must die before member on both front benches realise the scale of the atrocity and demand permanent ceasefire as the only way out understand the right hon lady strength of feeling but she do no service to member on either front bench who have make it clear that the reason why ceasefire would not work be know to the house and that try to secure humanitarian pause the long the well be the way to release humanitarian support to those who be suffer in the way she describe the despicable action of hamas and iran be responsible for this conflict but proportionality be important in the rule of war as my right hon friend know can he explain what we be do work with our friend in the middle east to encourage sense of proportionality in israel response so that we minimise the many civilian casualty while respect their need to take military action my hon friend express the balance very clearly and very well particularly in the first part of his question the important point which britain make continually to israel be that its response must be proportionate and it must operate within international humanitarian law we urgently need to see step towards permanent ceasefire and an end to hostility on all side but the minister be right that neither israel nor hamas have agree to that in seek the release of hostage and know that we need to see an end to hamas influence and place in gaza there ultimately need to be an alternative to israel current strategy with hospital now at break point food and medicine not get through and effectively the de development of gaza what be the government do to push for consensus at the un and for strategy to ensure that the international criminal court will be able to hold all party to account for their conduct the hon lady make an important point about the critical need to get support into gaza yesterday truck get through and litre of fuel get through during and december it be nothing like enough but we be do everything that we can in respect of the humanitarian effort alongside our likeminded partner to galvanise the international humanitarian community to get aid into gaza it be not an issue of get aid into the region the aid be there and there be plenty more back up to come it be about actually get it into gaza we be stretch every sinew to try to achieve an increase in humanitarian support as fast as we can few would deny israel right to defend itself against an internationally proscribe terrorist organisation but as military man do not always find it easy to reconcile that with what we be see on the ground in gaza or the broader operational nature of that campaign could the minister please assure of the effort be conduct behind close door to ensure israeli restraint my hon friend be right to underline the concern about the humanitarian casualty but as have say repeatedly in response to this urgent question we be do everything we can to make the point that he have emphasise hamas be an obstacle to peace and two state solution and they must release all hostage now while push for that as means to further pause in hostility can the minister confirm what discussion be take place with international partner to create the condition where israel be secure and palestinians can see path to reconstruction renewal and statehood in gaza reassure the hon lady that those discussion be indeed take place the foreign secretary be in washington dc last week and he have discussion with his counterpart the prime minister have lengthy conversation with prime minister netanyahu on december and at cop the prime minister meet israel qatar egypt and jordan he emphasise throughout the importance of provide political horizon the hon lady be right to identify the set of action that be require but she may rest assure that the government be do everything we can to pursue they be profoundly disappoint by the minister comment when he dismiss call for humanitarian ceasefire as be implausible if it be so implausible can he explain why that be the position of every other country in the world with the exception of the united states of america and do he not understand that it be damage this country credibility to be an honest broker in the necessary international discussion that have to follow can he name one action by his department that have be design to try to gain the trust of the palestinian people in this conflict on the hon gentleman last point be in no doubt that lord cameron visit to the west bank will have do just that on his first point perhaps he should ask those who be advocate for ceasefire the question that have seek to answer how can there be ceasefire when neither party to the military action would be willing to accept one since the terrible attack by hamas on october more than palestinians have be kill by illegal settler in the west bank and there be unconfirmed report of the involvement of the israel defence forces in the violence the criterion outline who can receive arm export licence from the government include strong wording on violence against woman and child what diplomatic engagement have the minister have to ensure that any arm export from this country be not use to facilitate unlawful military activity the hon lady be absolutely right to make it clear that the target killing of civilian be completely unacceptable that be why say in response to the shadow foreign secretary that we seek not just the arrest but the prosecution and punishment of those responsible in respect of arm licence she may well know that britain have the most demanding export licence regime of any country in the world think that can give we all confidence that those export licence be grant on the right term be it not very obvious that israel be herd the entire population of gaza in state of utter desperation and poverty with lack of food medicine and water and with serious injury that can not be treat and that its ultimate aim be to expel the population of gaza and to reoccupy it do the minister not think it be time that we support the call for ceasefire as every other nation in the world have do and stop be isolate in this ridiculous approach of say that somehow ceasefire can not work we have to start somewhere to save life we have to start somewhere to prevent this catastrophe from get even bad on top of the already kill in gaza have set out what we be try to do to relieve the suffering the right hon gentleman so eloquently describe in gaza but have to caution he that simple call for ceasefire be not the answer much well in the view of the government be to make it clear that humanitarian pause preferably extend humanitarian pause offer hope of the sort of relief that he and both wish to see when this terrible conflict come to an end as all war must both gaza and the west bank will require substantial investment to restore and enhance the economic wellbeing of the palestinian people what discussion be my right hon friend have with other country about how they may take role in an economic revival of the area which could play role in last peace my hon friend be absolutely right to emphasise that the economic reconstruction and rebuilding of gaza will be an essential element in any political settlement more widely as have set out the government be try to make sure that when there be an opportunity to drive forward that political horizon that be precisely what we will do have just meet with othman constituent from halifax who be originally from gaza and be utterly distressed about what his family back home be endure the un secretary general have declare that nowhere in gaza be safe for civilian we know that the aid get in be utterly insufficient and the humanitarian situation can not be address until the violence end have hear what the minister have to say but the humanitarian pause that have be secure might have feel impossible at the start of this conflict we urge he to redouble his effort to work towards an endure humanitarian ceasefire which surely be the next logical step agree very much with the hon lady about the importance of secure humanitarian pause that be exactly what we be do she will be pleased like to hear that the united kingdom permanent representative at the united nations be on visit to the region at this time to see among other thing how we can achieve precisely that the minister talk up the uk arm export licence but amnesty international have identify particular loophole in those licence the incorporation guideline allow uk component to be send to third destination for onward export to israel can he give any assurance that unlike in and that be not happen right now have set out the fact that britain have the tough export licence and regulation anywhere in the world of course if the hon lady have any evidence of those licence be infract in some way she should bring it to the attention of the authority the minister will be aware that as far back as october the independent un commission of inquiry say there be already clear evidence that war crime may have be commit in the late explosion of violence in israel and gaza and all those who have violate international law and target civilian must be hold accountable for their crime as of saturday the death toll be more than people of whom nearly be woman and child and thousand more be believe to be bury under the rubble every passing day be another day of child die like so many of my vauxhall constituent who email it be hard not to feel powerless when we watch the scale of death and destruction day after day do the minister agree that the international criminal court should be the jurisdiction that address the conduct of all party in adhere to international law the government have make clear what the role and remit of the international criminal court be as the hon lady will be aware the british government be strong supporter of the international criminal court the situation that she describe only emphasise the requirement the demand that we achieve another humanitarian pause and be able to get deeply need humanitarian supply into gaza with hundred of thousand of palestinians now homeless and part of northern gaza render effectively uninhabitable there be understandably real concern that many people will not be able to return to their home can the minister tell we what representation he have make to make it absolutely clear that permanent forced displacement of the gazan population be unacceptable not just across international border and into the west bank but within gaza itself the hon lady will know that in order to help those people the possibility of provide safe area in which support can be give be be actively look at by the united nations the problem with safe area be that they have to be absolutely safe and we must have the understanding that both hamas and israel and every other entity will guarantee safety when people be bring there to receive support that be an ongoing discussion but it be an area of considerable concern to the united nations and other humanitarian which be seek to operate in this space the labour party continue to call for cessation of hostility in gaza to give we the time and space to alleviate the immense suffering of palestinian civilian by get the require food water medicine and other aid into blockaded gaza and to facilitate the release of all remain hostage do the minister agree that the international community can and must use the next cessation of hostility to make political progress towards what we all want an end to the conflict and permanent ceasefire the hon gentleman be not think stray from the policy that have be set out by his front benchers we all want to see those pause develop so that urgently need humanitarian aid can get into gaza so in that respect think that he and the government be in agreement have hear the minister explanation of why the uk make the deeply disappointing decision not to support the un security council resolution call for ceasefire over the weekend he may have hear the comment of tom fletcher former ambassador and no adviser who say that when the uk support such resolution in it help to move the us away from veto and towards abstention ultimately secure ceasefire be the minister at risk of let the good be the enemy of the good when we should be grab every possible opportunity to end the bloodshed and the suffering that we see in gaza the government be do everything we possibly can have set out clearly the difficulty of achieve ceasefire when neither of the prime party to it be willing to accept it hope that the hon lady will reflect on that the uk abstention on the un security council resolution on friday be shocking and wholly wrong it have be report today that egypt have invoke resolution to circumvent the us veto on the security council act to maintain peace two million gazans be displace and face disease and starvation and people have be kill of whom be woman and child will the uk now back ceasefire implore you minister at an emergency session of the un general assembly that be the only way peace will be achieve we have quite few people stand be go to finish at pm and do not want member to miss out the hon lady make an eloquent call for ceasefire but she need to address the point that have be make elsewhere in the house about why ceasefire can not be achieve hope she will feel that the government be do the right thing in try to secure humanitarian pause and increase the flow of humanitarian supply through rafah and other entry into gaza do the minister share my upset and deep concern that the un security council be unable to find the wording for resolution to end fighting in palestine that all its member could agree on and to make political progress towards the permanent ceasefire we all desperately want if he do agree that newly word un resolution be need what role will the uk government play pay tribute to the british team at the united nations under its leader barbara woodward that team have an extraordinary effect punch above britain weight in try to corral people to agreement but hope the hon lady will understand that in the circumstance of last week it be not possible for britain to agree to resolution in many respect it be very good resolution but as point out if there be not the will to condemn hamas for the appalling atrocity commit on october we simply do not feel we could support it have to tell the minister that humanitarian pause be merely delay innocent child be be bomb and humanitarian pause do not stop that however can he tell we what consideration be be give to the huge number of gazans injure in the idf indiscriminate attack for whom proper treatment be utterly impossible constituent who be nhs clinician have get in touch with look to offer their assistance in the region just as soon as it be practical and safe to do so have any discussion take place about facilitate such offer if as think the hon gentleman be say those be offer to provide hospital and medical support we along with other be actively look at what support we can give to those who be injure in gaza and may come out of gaza the minister say early that international humanitarian law must always be uphold with no impunity but what do that mean in practice what mechanism be he propose we use and what specific conversation have his department have with the international criminal court to investigate potential breach of humanitarian law have it withdraw from the position of the former prime minister that israel be outside the jurisdiction of the icc must make it clear to the hon gentleman that the government position on the international criminal court have be well set out not least that it be not for minister to make those judgment but for judge the prosecutor and the court itself be afraid that can not help he on that point but on the importance of abide by international humanitarian law of there be no impunity and of there be retrospective judgment on that the hon gentleman will know that the british government have be one of the foremost government around the world in insist that impunity should never exist do the minister agree with labour that israel must not besiege or blockade gaza must comply with international law must protect innocent life and must not replicate the devastating aerial bombing tactic that have be use in northern gaza and accord to israeli report have result in of death be civilian the hon lady ask whether the government agree with labour on these matter as she know there be agreement on many of these thing across the two front benches in particular that call for ceasefire be not the right thing to do israeli defence minister gallant have be report as say that gaza will return to what it be before we will eliminate everything and that we be fight human animal and we act accordingly he be not the only israeli political leader to make such dehumanising statement all the while war crime be inarguably be commit by israeli force who have kill close to palestinian people do the minister believe that such statement indicate genocidal intent and what concrete step be he take to sanction those responsible what can say be that in gaza there will in the future be no place for hamas administration the idf promise we precision and intelligence but what the world be witness be the wholesale destruction of society and people what must change for the uk government to vote tomorrow for un security council motion for cessation of hostility that will ultimately lead to ceasefire the two point have mention about the un be that there be plenty of good line in the un security council resolution on which we abstain but that we will not support resolution that do not condemn hamas for the appalling event that take place on october welcome the shift in the uk government position to abstention at the united nations last week different position from that take by the united states qatar say that the former willingness to discuss pause be not in place at the moment and the minister have rightly say that event in gaza can not be allow to carry on what do he think it will take to re establish the willingness to discuss pause as first step hopefully towards the permanent ending of the conflict the right hon member be right to focus on secure these pause because there be precedent and the hope that we can achieve that what be most important be that everyone should press for these pause for as long as possible previously we be ask for five day pause as minimum so that the humanitarian supply and support can get into gaza to clarify something the minister say about the united nations resolution if it have rightly condemn hamas would the uk government have vote for it so that we can all see an end to the killing unfortunately it be not possible to achieve that compromise when it come to negotiate the un resolution but the hon member may rest assure that in all these matter britain be force for good at the un in try to achieve the end aim that everyone in this house agree be require could the minister clarify whether the uk government fail to support the un security council resolution because it do not mention hamas or because they oppose ceasefire in any event or both if the government have doubt about israel adherence to international humanitarian law should they not call for ceasefire observe by all side until they be persuade that palestinian civilian be not subject to collective punishment it be the plausibility of ceasefire that inform our decision on that matter but on the hon member specific question we be unable to support the resolution because it do not make an absolute condemnation of what hamas do on october do the minister now accept that if israel intention be to raze gaza to the ground which it seem as though it be that can not possibly help move the situation towards long term two state solution or do he suspect there may be some in the israeli government who have no intention of want to achieve that solution do not believe it be israel intention to raze gaza to the ground israel intention be to ensure that hamas terrorist can never inflict on the state of israel the appalling event that take place on october give that the un security council be unable regrettably to achieve ceasefire because of the decision of the us and uk governments what discussion have take place about create ceasefire in the south of gaza to which many palestinians in gaza have be send for their security and safety and would the minister advocate such position for reason the hon member will understand there be no discussion about ceasefire within the government have very clearly set out the reason but on southern gaza we be explore every possible mechanism to bring the relief of humanitarian supply include the extremely difficult but plausible advent of safe zone it be possible to condemn both the brutal rape and murder carry out by hamas and israel indiscriminate and illegal killing of woman and child and we now have scholar of genocide state that this continued bombardment of gaza be at grave risk of be genocide with that in mind at what point will the government consider support permanent ceasefire as have repeatedly set out to the house the reason why the government and indeed the opposition front bench be unable to call for ceasefire be very clear at the end of last week the us veto security council resolution bring about by the un secretary general trigger article what be the government do to encourage our friend in washington to support or at least abstain on resolution that do refer to hamas and that be acceptable to other permanent member of the security council the team in our mission at the un in new york work night and day to try and get progress on the terrible event take place in the middle east and it will be encourage by the hon gentleman word that more can and should be do united nations secretary generals initiate article very rarely understand this be only the seventh time that this have happen and it be only initiate when the secretary general believe an event threaten the maintenance of international peace and security as the uk abstain on the resolution and member support it with the us against the uk be in an isolated position do this mean the uk government disagree fundamentally with the position of the un secretary general the un secretary general and the british government work extremely closely together it be an extraordinarily important and close relationship for both party but have set out very clearly why it have not be possible for britain to support ceasefire and above all it be because of the impracticality of call for it thank the minister for his clear answer and clear understanding of the conflict the destruction and dismantling of the hamas terrorist group must be achieve and conclude before any permanent peace can be find story in the press today tell of those who come so close to be release the return of hostage be an urgent matter for the family who have wait over month imagine the horror be face by their love one what progress be be make to see at least the woman and child return and can our government and our minister say whether anything far can be do to help to see this war end and people return to semblance of normal life my hon friend speak for many in the house with his compassion and determination to improve what be dreadful position as have be so clearly set out throughout this urgent question and the whole house will join he in hop we can make progress in the come day and week former afghan special forces deportation urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make statement on former afghan special force face deportation from pakistan to afghanistan thank the shadow minister for ask this urgent question the afghan relocation and assistance policy be far more generous in design than predecessor scheme such as the ex gratia scheme none the less arap be specific scheme intend to support those who work for with or alongside the uk armed force in support of the uk mission or national security objective in afghanistan while we be acutely aware of the difficult circumstance in which many afghans find themselves not everyone will be eligible even if they work for the afghanistan security force many afghans have work in proximity to uk armed force but this may have be in service of the afghan government in nation building capacity or though work directly with other nation and know as the triples be afghan lead taskforce set up to counter drug trafficking and organised crime and they report into the afghan ministry of interior affairs they be therefore component of the afghan national security force and be not automatically in scope for relocation under arap regrettably we can not relocate all former member of the afghan national security force under the arap scheme that mean that some afghans whose bravery and heroism be in no doubt whatever indeed serve alongside many of they myself such as certain member of the and taskforce will not be eligible for relocation under arap each arap application be assess on case by case basis all application include those from former member of the triples be scrutinise on their own merit and in line with our publish policy and eligibility criterion available on the government website and in line with the immigration rule all applicant irrespective of job role will be eligible only if they individually meet these criterion outline in the publish policy must emphasise this point for the record any suggestion that we be make blanket decision eligible or ineligible for any cohort of applicant or that we have any preconceive position on any application to the scheme be simply untrue that be not the approach that defence take on processing application as matter of policy the mod consult the evidence provide from each applicant and our own internal record and engage with internal stakeholder and other departments when determine eligibility in line with the afghan relocation and assistance policy and the immigration rule since before the fall of kabul the government treatment of afghans who work alongside british troop have be shameful saga of failure minister have fail to deal with the ballooning backlog of arap application broken housing promise data breach and afghans stick abroad in limbo fear for their life today we have learn from report that former afghan special force who serve alongside british troop be possibly face deportation back to afghanistan let we be clear that mean that life could be put at serious harm from the taliban all of we in this house want to see the government finally and fully honour the commitment give by britain as nation to these afghans that be why we be all here today urgent detail be now need from the minister about this escalating situation first how many former afghan special force who serve alongside our force be at risk of imminent deportation from afghanistan to pakistan what assessment have be make by the ministry of defence of the threat to these afghan elite force if they be deport back to afghanistan what assessment have be make of the threat to their family and be it as grim as we all fear what be the current backlog in arap case in parliamentary question answer last week about the safety of afghan refugee in pakistan the government say that they have receive assurance from the government of pakistan that afghans be support under the afghans relocations and assistance policy arap and afghan citizens resettlement scheme acrs will remain safe in pakistan while they await relocation to the uk in light of today news what be the original assurance give to the uk by the pakistani government can the minister confirm that zero afghans pende arap or acrs application decision or relocation will be send back to afghanistan general sir richard barrons who serve with the british army for year in afghanistan describe the failure to relocate these former afghan special force to the uk as disgrace and betrayal he be right be he not there can be no more excuse minister must fix their ail afghan scheme and honour the commitment give to our afghan friend before they be deport back to afghanistan and potentially kill by the taliban be not sure where to start on that what the hon gentleman think be knowingly do be conflate number of separate issue there be the issue over the processing of those who can legitimately come to the uk under the arap scheme find those applicant in among ten of thousand of application many of which be duplicate and many of which be bogus though plenty be not have be heck of task for the team within the mod that have be task with that over the past two year however we be get to the bottom of the pile crucially those who be eligible under category which be those who work directly for the british armed force whether as patrol interpreter or cultural adviser and so on be know to we we have the employment record so as have say to the house many time we have be able to go into the list of application find those whom we be look for and whom we know to have work for we and accelerate their approval as we get through the tail end of the application we be see lot of rejection because frankly we have already go ahead and find those who match the employment record that we have from our time in afghanistan on those who be eligible for the core of the scheme have great deal of confidence that we really be reach the bottom of the list and we be move at pace to bring they out will first answer the hon gentleman question about the deportation of those who be eligible speak to both the uk high commissioner to islamabad and the pakistan high commissioner to london this afternoon before come to the house both be entirely comfortable with the assurance we have receive from the pakistan government that those for whom we have make an eligibility decision will not be deport know of one case where somebody who have receive rejection be deport before their appeal be hear be not sure that there be necessarily anything we can do to mitigate that pakistan be after all sovereign country and have every right to say who can and can not be in the country but that person whose review be successful be successfully bring back into pakistan and be now wait to come to the uk as for those in islamabad wide pakistan or any other third country and who may have work for the afghan special force the answer be that we can not possibly know that because we do not have the employment record of the afghan special force therefore we can not say who do and do not work with they we know who have apply to arap and every time someone do we make an individual judgment about what that person do be they just member of the triples heroic and important but not necessarily work directly for and with we or be they member of the triples who routinely work with uk special force or the intelligence community who would thus be eligible under arap category appreciate that that be suboptimal answer to the hon gentleman question but if we do not know who work for the afghan special force because they work for the afghan ministry of interior affairs or the afghan ministry of defence it be impossible to say how many of those people may or may not now be in pakistan think be right in say that the international security assistance force be officially nato assistance force to the then afghan government so what be there to prevent nato country from band together and make joint representation to the pakistani government that whatever they do with former service personnel who at our request fight against the taliban they should not now mercilessly deport they to the tender non mercy of the taliban who be currently out for vengeance understand my right hon friend question he be great champion of this cohort nato country and indeed country beyond nato like australia routinely make representation to the pakistani government who have be incredibly flexible and supportive in work for we the challenge it be sad to have to say this be that there be many people who claim to have serve in the triples who may well not have do if my right hon friend be to go through the casework file on our system he would see the same picture submit again and again as evidence by people claim to have work in the triples absent those employment record from the afghan moia or the afghan mod it be incredibly hard to say who be and who be not legitimate give that often people be access on social medium stock photograph that they seek to use as evidence have every confidence that the pakistan government be be incredibly flexible and supportive but it be very difficult to ask they to allow everybody who claim to have serve in unit to stay when that be incredibly hard to verify other than when people in the uk mod the us dod the australian department of defence or wherever else can personally vouch for the relationship they have with that operator be sure the minister will recognise that it be not only members of the house but some of his ex comrade in arm even people like my own brother who serve two tour of duty in afghanistan who be deeply concerned about the idea of their former comrade in arm be force back into the hand of the taliban to they it seem to reflect reality there be lack of clarity about why some people be not get access to scheme to access the uk especially those who flee without paperwork because as be sure we can imagine the taliban will not be give ex special force any passport anytime soon wonder whether the minister answer two specific point do he recognise the reality that ex special force from afghanistan would face if they be give back into the hand of the taliban do he agree that while pakistan may have the right to do so it have not always be the good arbiter of relationship with the new regime in afghanistan and have sometimes go out of its way to undermine collective approach to they on the hon gentleman last point be reluctant to join he in make that criticism because in my experience of deal with the pakistan government of whom have ask an awful lot as do the chief of the general staff when he recently visit and be host by the pakistan chief of the army staff they have be incredibly accommodate they have arguably be more accommodate to the uk request than those of other ally and partner on the hon gentleman first question deeply uncomfortable one do indeed recognise the danger recognise the danger face by the kandak that serve alongside in the upper helmand valley recognise the danger that exist for every other afghan army and air force unit which be undoubtedly closely relate to isaf force throughout the campaign but for they none of the resettlement scheme from any of the isaf country or their partner allow they to come because they be not set up for those who serve in the wide afghan force as veteran of that conflict someone who live cheek by jowl with kandak can tell he that it make sick but that be the reality to make they all eligible would be to give eligibility to hundred of thousand of servicepeople and five time that again to bring their dependant that be simply not an endeavour that the uk can undertake know from work with the minister on operation pitting the passion that he bring to this work and the deep debt of gratitude he personally owe to those who fight alongside he he will appreciate the house concern that we could see someone who fight alongside our force force from pakistan back to afghanistan take on board his point that the entirety of the special force work with the whole mission and not just with the uk so what discussion be he have with our ally about perhaps have quota for move people over that be clumsy way of put it but it be the good way can summarise it what work be he do with home office resource to ensure that there be no backlog in arap place and what be he do with colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities to ensure that housing be available for those who need to be relocate from pakistan my hon friend be right to ask whether it be possible for country that have relocation scheme to club together to share the burden of any particular grouping the difficulty be that without the employment record there be no way of know the entirety of those who serve in that grouping thus as say previously member of the triples or other unit the national directorate of security for example tend to be grant category because there be member of the uk armed force or uk intelligence community or veteran who can personally vouch for the role they play in the conflict that will be the same for the australians the canadians the americans the danes and whoever else it would be impossible to say that an entire taskforce or could all come without know the totality of the employment record because there would be simply no way to determine who do or do not serve with those unit thank the minister for his statement have constituent who be member of the special force in afghanistan will not name he and who approach several month ago about his family stick in pakistan the bureaucracy and disconnection between different part of government be astounding finally we have relocate his family to the uk but it be not an easy process it take long time for to wade through the treacle of the various government departments who be in charge of that we have just spend million on the rwanda resettlement scheme surely put some money and effort behind the scheme would solve the problem number of policy decision and reality around wide immigration in this country have mean that arap have move at variable pace ultimately arap sit under the mod and thus acrs sit elsewhere since the pakistanis make it clear that they would start to deport those without document we have be able to accelerate movement both from afghanistan to pakistan and from pakistan to the uk regret that it come on the back of number of month of relatively little movement but we be now move with an urgency that feel much more comfortable standing in the house and talk about have just come off the phone to friend who live in the mountain and work with the he explain how the foreign office pay they through the ministry of interior affairs but he and his colleague give they cash to top up their payment effectively to pay they special force pay he say that the mod position be the most ludicrous argument have hear in my life if it be not so sad it would be hilarious the work with every single brigade in helmand and be describe as an indispensable part of task force helmand do outreach and reconnaissance do the government not need to take slightly hard look at this the government be look at it very hard indeed we consider every case on its individual merit if an individual serve in one of those taskforce or in the national directorate of security and be not entitle to come but there be evidence that they work closely with uk intelligence community uk special force or our embassy we be make the case for they to come under category as could have say in response to many question where colleague feel that they have the evidence need to show direct connection between the individual and the uk rather than simply their service within unit we will consider that evidence on the individual basis that we set out be in afghanistan at the very beginning with the triples it be particularly painful that despite commitment and assurance from the uk government this cohort of afghans and their family be leave fear for their life listen carefully to what the minister have to say but have see credible evidence of an individual who serve with the triples and who be reject for the arap scheme by the mod he be subsequently arrest by the taliban beat and kill do the minister know of any triples who have die under similar circumstance if he do what more can be do to prevent the loss of life of the hero we serve alongside the house may think that be speak relatively plainly in response to these question undoubtedly significant number of people who serve in the afghan national security force like the person the hon gentleman refer to be in mortal danger as consequence of have serve in the afghan army air force or special force it be also reality that no country have set up relocation scheme that extend beyond those who work directly for that country and that verify the service of those people unless directly alongside the uk special force or uk intelligence community that be extraordinarily hard would like to sit down with the hon gentleman who be great champion of this cause to talk through the case that he know of there be no point pretend that there be not many other but there be also the reality of how hard it be to verify the service of those who just serve in the unit rather than explicitly alongside uk personnel give the contrast between the rhetoric and promise of resettlement and the shambolic reality face many afghans who work for we with we or fight alongside our troop as detail by many member across the house what assessment have the minister make of the likely impact of his apparent bad faith on the willingness of foreign national to offer we their assistance in future push back on the idea that this be all some sort of failure the reality be that we have move out very nearly people we have continue to do so against incredible difficulty in afghanistan and while need to work very carefully alongside the pakistan government to meet their requirement so do not accept that initial characterisation as for the hon lady wide question about what impact the scheme may have on our ability to work with partner force and locally employ civilian in future would turn the question round the other way my grave concern be that while think we be do the right thing by those we serve with and alongside in afghanistan because of the circumstance of our departure from afghanistan if we set the precedent where every time our military work anywhere in the world those who work for we or alongside we in partner force have an expectation of immigration right in the uk that will make it incredibly difficult to operate that be not the question she ask but think the counterfactual be equally worth consider early this year the minister say that the backlog for arap would be clear by august and early he say that he be get to the bottom of the pile exactly how many application be still outstanding apologise to the house mr deputy speaker if say that we would do it by august and we have not own my word and thank the right hon lady for point out that have not achieve that my knowledge be that there be less than few hundred eligible application that we need to find there be around people in afghanistan who we need to move out and around leave in pakistan who we need to bring in in all would expect another to arrival we be aim to that get do as quickly as possible because the pakistan government be keen that we do so without delay we be work with they to achieve that be grateful to the minister for explain what engagement he have have with representative of pakistan government in islamabad do the assurance he receive from islamabad in relation to personnel who will not now be deport to afghanistan extend to their family yes absolutely for those who be in pakistan with an acceptance or eligibility we have be work with the pakistan authority through our high commission in islamabad to make sure that the afghan principal and their family be protect from the work the pakistan immigration service have under way if the hon gentleman or indeed other member shake their head knowingly know otherwise would be grateful for the name of the people they be concern about and will make sure that be discuss with the pakistan high commission without delay the minister say that he be process the people who have be accept for arap to come to the uk from pakistan at pace since the hotel they be stay in be close down include in my constituency how many who be eligible and have be give the paperwork have actually come to the uk secondly where somebody believe they have be wrongly deny arap will he undertake to look at case where there be very clear evidence that decision may have be make wrongly in the last couple of week think off the top of my head about seven flight so about people have come to the uk in december we will move significantly more than in any month since august when operation pitting happen those move be combination of arap and acr the reason we be able to move they at such pace be that we have mobilise quite significant amount of the mod training estate to act as transitional accommodation we be try to move people through as quickly as possible into service family accommodation which we have make available we be hugely grateful to local authority all over the country for how closely they be work with we to deliver that while no one doubt that this be complex situation the case that we be bring up reflect how it have be manage and think that that be what present the challenge have two separate constituent who be under the direct supervision of uk force indeed the uk pay for they to be train so there should be record in the uk that they be work for the afghan force the minister say himself that he feel sick about people who would have work alongside colleague who may now be at risk of harm as result of be deport back from pakistan to afghanistan will he meet those of we who have constituency case that we believe should meet his threshold for an intervention so that we can establish whether anyone have be miss out and ensure that we do not miss out people who serve with our colleague for want of piece of paper of course would like to meet the hon lady to discuss those case give the way she describe they my instinct suggest that these may have be people who serve in unit that be mentor or partner by the uk armed force indeed my own battalion on the tour on which it go shortly after leave do exactly that with the kandak who be base in helmand at the time that do not quite constitute what arap be set up to do but would love to sit down with the hon lady to talk through the detail of the case if be right and she be wrong should like to explain and if she be right and be wrong we will of course look at the eligibility of those people be sure that the minister will have hear some of the comment from senior former uk military leader who have speak about this issue in the last day or two it sound as if somehow the uk government have desert these afghan hero who support we through the conflict can the minister tell we whether any afghans await an arap decision have be deport from pakistan to afghanistan and be now at risk from the taliban do not have the number and be not sure how would obtain it but will inquire within the department whether can if can will write to the hon gentleman and if can not will write to he to say that can not to those of we who have serve the term that the hon gentleman use in the first part of his question have particular meaning suspect that he mean it in that way but that be not what have happen here the offer that the uk have make in comparison with that of every other country give our size and the size of our military commitment be one of the most if not the most generous we have work incredibly hard to bring people out in very difficult circumstance and it break the heart of all those who have anything to do with operation in afghanistan on the military side in the intelligence community or in diplomatic context not to be able to bring everyone here but that be simply an unrealistic aim arap be set up to be what it be likewise the acr and the hon gentleman while disappoint in the government policy will need to accept from that we be work as hard as we can to bring both those scheme to resolution as quickly as we can thank the minister for the helpful clarity that he have provide today in particular on the eligibility of member of afghan special force for the arap scheme that have be say however would suggest that whether and wherever people be fight alongside uk or other nato troop in afghanistan they be still fight the taliban they be still cause they attrition and loss and pressure on whichever front that might be should have think at the very least that under the acr member of special force have assist in stand up for value such as free speech woman right and the rule of law give that they have do that would not discretion be the well part of valour especially when we be speak about people who potentially fight with great valour the minister have talk about get to the bottom of the list that be great but it be not the target the target be to get everyone we possibly can back to safety in the uk and free from the clutch of the taliban be that still the minister position think have answer that question in different form over the past half hour it be the case sadly that not everyone who serve alongside the british force within an afghan unit will be eligible it be also impossible think to verify the service of those who do not serve directly alongside the british armed force in circumstance in which there be someone within the british system who can vouch for the closeness of that service the sad reality be that there be ten of thousand of desperate people in afghanistan who be wrongly apply to the arap scheme out of desperation the same be happen with the acr and show evidence that be not real we have do our absolute good over the last two year to find the people we be look for and to verify the service of those who be not on employment list our effort in those regard across the uk special force intelligence community and the military have be extensive but it would be impossible to just say that everyone who have serve in one unit could come because we would have no way of know who have and who have not thank the minister for respond to urgent question we be now go to move on to the

time on friday february and to be print bill we have lot to look forward to on fridays next year look forward to see you all interruption well some of you leasehold and freehold reform bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time before proceed to the heart of the bill may offer few word of thank to those who have labour long in this field we all know that leasehold and freehold legislation have preoccupy the house not just in this parliament but in many parliaments in the past indeed in the and much of the house time be take up debate the fine point of such legislation be once describe as young man in hurry be now an old man but be still in hurry in order to make sure that this legislation make progress and that we liberate leaseholder from many of the unfair practice to which they be still subject will say bit more about that in second but want first to say special word of thank to my predecessor as secretary of state who help to issue the consultation and lie the groundwork for the measure that we be introduce today thank my right hon friend the members for newark robert jenrick and for bromsgrove sajid javid but in particular thank the late james brokenshire who do so much work to get we to this point have thank they can not but thank my hon friend the member for redditch rachel maclean who be brilliant colleague in the department and do so much of the heavy lifting to ensure that this legislation be ready to be introduce she have be brilliant colleague and great minister in so many way all the good thing in the bill be down to she anything that be lack be down to also thank member of the all party parliamentary group on leasehold and commonhold reform who have work so hard for so long to ensure that the ground could be lay for today legislation thank the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders for his work and in particular his predecessor the former mp for poplar and limehouse jim fitzpatrick must thank the father of the house my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley who have be the single most consistent and brave voice in stand up for leaseholder also thank even though she be not in the chamber the hon member for st albans daisy cooper who speak on behalf of the liberal democrats and have contribute to the work of the appg the appg would not have be able to do its work without the leasehold knowledge partnership in particular thank martin boyd who have be hire by the government to head up our leasehold advisory service and sebastian both have contribute to help leaseholder and provide they with the advice and counsel they need to navigate this tangled landscape also thank the campaigner some of whom have chance to talk to early who have be indefatigable in make it clear that the law need to change thank in particular katie kendrick cath williams and joanne darbyshire all of whom have make an impeccable case for change throughout what be the problem that we be try to solve basically it be this leasehold as form of tenure be essentially deal where someone be invite to buy home and then instead of become full homeowner they be treat or can be treat as tenant it be fundamentally unfair system and fundamentally inequitable tenure because those who buy flat and increasingly in recent year house in good faith pay market rate assume and hop that they would be homeowner in the full sense of the word have find that rather than be homeowner they be at the whim of the ultimate owner of the freehold who be in effect their landlord in the past there be justification there be case and example where those who hold the freehold operate in an enlightened and paternalistic way for example the freehold of property be sometimes hold by trade union or other enlightened organisation that would ensure that the common interest of all those within particular building be look after it be still the case that some landowner and freeholder take their obligation towards leaseholder seriously ensure that the service charge be levy in an appropriate way keep the ground rent at an appropriately low level and ensure that the building be maintain in good state of repair however individual leaseholder should not simply have to rely on the good will and good character of whoever the freeholder be they need well protection in law which be what we seek to achieve with the bill many of the leasehold home in rother valley be build by the national coal board to provide home for miner and their family with the intention that the ground rent would be peppercorn but since the closure of the pit many of those freehold especially in area such as thurcroft wales and north anston have be sell to private developer who be take advantage of their leaseholder for example in thurcroft leaseholder be force to represent themselves in court when the freeholder try to raise the ground rent from year to year which be absolutely shameful how can we ensure that freeholder must act reasonably and not stray too far from the spirit of the original legislation my hon friend be absolutely right the miner family and their descendant whom he represent so well be originally in home that the ncb establish to ensure that those in the pit village he represent would have proper landlord provide stewardship care and support but as he rightly point out the freehold ownership have subsequently be use not as an obligation towards the leaseholder but as commodity to be trade more and more freehold be in the hand of entity often base offshore that regard they as licence to extort from the leaseholder rather than as an obligation to be discharge have raise concern on behalf of leaseholder in my constituency on many occasion in this house particularly on the issue of service charge which the secretary of state refer to moment ago and the lack of transparency around they have see again and again case where certain information be not provide to leaseholder where they be not sure that the money be be spend on what they have provide funding for or where it be not clear whether for example there have be an adequate tendering process for work insurance and so on can he explain what will be do on that and whether it will fully extend to england and wales what co operation have he have with the welsh government about those provision it be the case that this bill cover england and wales obviously the hon gentleman be aware that there be slightly different tribunal that operate in each jurisdiction but it will precisely address the situation he mention it will ensure there be transparency over service charge and through the appropriate tribunal in each jurisdiction it will become easy on the part of the leaseholder to contest any unfairness rise just want to make one or two additional point and then be happy to give way personally one of the moment where realise that the system which be hard to defend in any case be fundamentally break be in the aftermath of the grenfell tragedy we know then that it be important that responsibility be take for remediate building that be unsafe we know then that individual and organisation have to take that responsibility on their own shoulder we know then that freeholder if they be true to the spirit of the original legislation would say yes we have responsibility for this building and for all those within it we have responsibility to make sure this building be safe therefore we should have responsibility to pay for the remediation but do we find freeholder queue up to do that absolutely not they be there ready to extract income at the high possible rate whenever they could through ground rent and service charge but when they be call upon to discharge their responsibility to the leaseholder within those flat they be absent they run away from their responsibility that be why have limit to no patience now with the well fund lobby group that stand up for those freeholder and seek to ensure that they can continue to extract money from leaseholder it seem to that at critical point the argument that be sometimes make on behalf of those people disappear because of their negligence and their moral fault the right hon gentleman say that traditionally it be flat that be leasehold but increasingly it be house mainly fuel by the government help to buy scheme in my constituency persimmon homes business model be structure around not only sell on the leasehold but the tactic of include area of the estate that traditionally would have be pass over to local authority as the responsibility of the leaseholder would he agree that the government need to take some responsibility for the tsunami of money they throw at some of those developer and for turn blind eye to what they be do in their business model take the right hon gentleman point but he be conflate two thing help to buy can be criticise or defend on its own term and believe it be the right intervention to ensure in particular that more first time buyer could get on to the property market however he be also right that leasehold which as he say be originally tenure design for flat be then extend to house and in way that be difficult to defend it have expand over recent year that be why we be legislate now to ensure that we can stop it there be two separate argument that can be have there particularly look forward to that part of the secretary of state speech when he will tell we whether this will apply to new leasehold or will be retrospective on those suffer under exist leasehold arrangement however there be one step the government take that have not be helpful to leaseholder and of which have personal experience create presumption in favour of development where the airspace above block of flat be sell and the freeholder then insist on have one or two more floor build on top that can cause immense damage to the building not to mention disruption and then who get the bill for pay for the damage it be transfer from the freeholder to the leaseholder the government should think again about that presumption in allow that sort of ill consider development my right hon friend make an important point on permit development right on the whole be in favour of the extension of permit development right because want to see an increase in housing supply overall but it be incumbent on the government to review how those right have be operate he raise one concern but there be other legitimate concern about the way permit development right when commercial building have be turn into residential have mean that the quality of those new residential flat have be insufficiently high also know that colleague not least in london be concerned about potential future extension of permit development right there be responsibility on and other to review their impact and that be what we be do separate from this particular legislation rise an embarrassment of rich will give way to all colleague currently stand and then will try to make progress represent an area with lot of leasehold house it be just cynical money make scam some people own house but be require to pay an admin charge to change the flooring or have pet so it do not feel as if they own it can understand the floor thing if they be in flat but not if they be in house it be just con could agree more one of the challenge here be the lack of voice for our constituent in try to address the problem the secretary of state say that he can not defend leasehold none of we can it be feudal process that still deny our constituent voice over the thing that be most precious to they their home if he agree with that why will he not agree with we that we should move forward to commonhold whereby everybody have voice and say in their own building actually agree that commonhold be the ideal form of tenure but there be certain technical question about when commonhold can apply not least if building also have commercial us on the low floor when we come to clause will the secretary of state clarify whether good value apply to leaseholder or to freeholder it certainly seem that leaseholder do not get good value when test what additionalitie and enhancement be put into their scheme that be certainly true and quite agree the secretary of state be talk about leasehold house be recently visit by group of resident from hampton wick in my constituency who have be collectively try to buy the freehold on their house they have very obstructive freeholder and be now resort to an enfranchisement notice under section of the leasehold reform act but that require valuation from for which there be no record available so they be now be obstruct in buy the freehold by that legislative basis when the bill introduce new methodology for calculate the value of enfranchisement will that old provision be get rid of believe that it should be and encourage the hon lady constituent as be sure she have do to be in touch with martin boyd leasehold advisory service to be absolutely clear that they be get the support they need it be little disappointing that the secretary of state do not refer to the levelling up housing and communities committee report of the government work with the appg have follow many of the report recommendation but some of those recommendation we will come to they later with your permission mr deputy speaker have not be include so will make just couple of point the real challenge be first that freeholder who will not comply with any legislation or will try to avoid it do not reply to letter have exchange information with the minister for housing planning and building safety on how to deal with coppen estates and what the penalty will be for non compliance secondly there be freeholder who seek to move the ownership of property around in order to avoid the legislation why not give exist leaseholder the right of first refusal before any freehold be sell be very grateful to the hon gentleman and his committee for all their work it be discourteous of when run through the name of those to whom be grateful not to mention they his broad point about not just the operation of the freehold system but the way in which different aspect of the property market work be fair one the use of opaque overseas entity and special purpose vehicle the way in which ultimate beneficial ownership can be hide be all problem that require to be address the bill be pretty lengthy and substantial and deal with many of the issue will go on to explain why we have take the approach that we have but there be other abuse within the property and land market system that require to be address which we will address and not just in this parliament but after we be return at the next general election thank my right hon friend for give way and for the pragmatic approach that the government have take in this very complex area in my constituency of dover and deal we have fail development sunningdale home and long stand problem with persimmon homes in relation to sholden both situation relate to the lack of adoption by local authority and to service charge and other management arrangement would be grateful if my right hon friend could say more about the way in which those sort of situation will be help and whether there will be any retrospective help for situation that have remain unresolved for many year be very grateful to my hon friend she and my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller have be particularly energetic in press to deal with this issue of leasehold home fleecehold estate as they have become widely know which be believe precisely the phenomenon that the right hon member for north durham mr jones be also refer to the bill will ensure that there be ban on new leasehold home but as well as avert that problem in the future we be attempt to deal with the difficult situation we have all inherit we will do so by make sure that we squeeze every possible income stream that freeholder currently use so that in effect their capacity to put the squeeze on leaseholder end that will mean the effective destruction of the leasehold system do not take my word for it as sebastian of the leasehold knowledge partnership have make clear in his writing the bill be full on assault on leasehold income stream first we have consultation on ground rent can not pre empt that consultation but at its conclusion we will legislate on the basis of that set of response in order to ensure that ground rent be reduce and can only be levy in justifiable way as say can not pre empt the consultation but in way already have because be ask by the select committee last week what my favour approach would be and believe that it should be peppercorn of course if compelling evidence be produce as secretary of state with great civil servant will look at it but my preference be clear and suspect that it be the preference of the house as well indeed it be important to say that that particular squeezing of the freeholder income stream go beyond what the law commission recommend we be really grateful for all of the law commission work but it be little bit cautious in this area we be deliberately say no know that some people will say what about right under the european convention on human right you be take property away from people respect the echr but if it stand in the way of defend the interest of people in this country who have be exploit by ground rent massaging be determined to legislate on behalf of those people because their interest matter more than that particular piece of legislation be grateful to the secretary of state for the way he be address this issue can draw his attention to particular variant of this practice that exist in my constituency between developer and local authority scheme be allow whereby resident be and continue to be charge for access to public open space on their estate and indeed to maintain neighbouring park that resident across the district can enjoy that be surely wrong and hope he will look into that matter the hon gentleman be absolutely right number of the people who have build operate and retain the freehold on these estate levy service charge for all sort of thing that in my view be totally inappropriate that be why the bill make clear that service charge have to be issue in standardise format so that they can be more easily scrutinise and challenge it also make clear that those charge can be challenge in such way as to ensure that egregious example such as the one the hon gentleman have mention will end be not against what the secretary of state be try to do but philosophically there be reason why the conservative party have be the defender of property right it be to do with freedom and establish right so it be nothing to do with the echr or anything like that before this debate become just about bash landlord what about the duchy of cornwall there be excellent freeholder that have traditionally maintain property and do wonderful work in ensure that property be well maintain and in look after their tenant quite agree with my right hon friend there be good landlord and the duchy of cornwall have be stand out example as have be the cadogan estate the howard de walden estate and so on they be responsible landlord absolutely but an individual leaseholder should not have to rely on the good will and the grace of his grace as it be to get the protection they need there be no stauncher defender of capitalism and property right than but what have happen be that freehold have become utterly tear away from the warp and weft of the capitalist system as we understand it in this country and have become tradeable commodity that foreign entity be use to exploit our people who have work hard and save to get their own home so whose side be on homeowner who have work hard and save up to secure mortgage or shadowy foreign entity that be essentially attempt to rip off british citizen be on the side of homeowner when the secretary of state be consider the evidence from the consultation he mention will he adhere to his own adage of follow the money and remember that those people advocate for high ground rent probably have motivation for do so my hon friend be completely right will be look at the response to the consultation and be sure that some of london fine legal firm and most eloquent solicitor will be put in some very thoughtful contribution but the question will be who be pay for they and how much be they be pay to my mind people can buy silver tongue eloquence but what be far more important be actually be on the right side of justice will the secretary of state give way believe that most of the people in the house be on the right side of justice especially the hon lady on ground rent share owner who have staircase their way up to and become leaseholder obviously have long lease of year but face the issue of have their ground rent double every say year clearly that be an unfairness in the system so will the secretary of state consultation address that point believe it will must now make progress because know number of people want to contribute so will try to run through the other argument about why we be take the approach that we be mention service charge and one other example to which the father of the house have of course persistently draw our attention of where those who have be manage property on behalf of the ultimate owner have abuse their position be that of insurance commission we will be take step in the bill to make sure that insurance charge be transparent and that fair handling fee be bring in the fact that can list all these example just show hon member the way in which freeholder have operate many who have get hold of such freehold have be think right okay we can jack up the ground rent great we can have service charge keep they opaque and add something tell you what insurance let try to get more out of that it be persistent pattern of behaviour that do require reform another pattern of behaviour be the way that lease extension and the whole question of enfranchisement have be go if someone lease go below year and they want to enfranchise themselves they have to pay what be call marriage value that be the principle that by bring together the ownership of the freehold and the leasehold in one by enfranchise themselves bring those two together in marriage people be enrich themselves again however it have be use by freeholder to bilk leaseholder overall which be why the approach we be take will in effect eliminate marriage value it be also why when we talk about lease extension instead of people have to extend and extend again generation after generation we be say that lease can be extend to year in effect as say this will make sure that one of the approach that freeholder have take to extract more cash from leaseholder will end agree with the secretary of state about the seriousness of the problem of excessive insurance premium be charge to leaseholder and will give an example if be able to contribute later do the secretary of state agree that the solution require risk pool among insurer the initiative on that seem to have stall can he hold out the prospect of the delay be resolve broadly on the whole question of insurance be due to meet the chair baroness morgan of cotes and the chief executive of the association of british insurers later this week to address not just that question but some other relate question will the secretary of state give way will at this stage freely admit that this bill do not go as far as some in the house and elsewhere would like strong argument have be make about how property agent can be well regulate and lord best in another place have make argument that find incredibly persuasive so why not legislate for they now well as mention early this bill have many clause deal with technical aspect of property law require close scrutiny and be likely to face lobby exercise from deep pocket interest outside attempt to derail it legislate to give effect to lord best proposal and to set up new regulator be always wee bit wary about set up new quango but on this occasion he make good case would require significant additional legislative time of kind we simply do not have in the lifetime of this parliament there be change we be make overall in order to deal with some of the abuse for which manage agent be responsible but there be still some unfinished business happily grant that and there be organisation like firstport which many of we will be familiar with from our work as constituency mps that require some gentle direction towards behave in well fashion be grateful to my right hon friend my hon friend the member for redditch rachel maclean and ministers for bring the bill forward the secretary of state speak about leasehold improvement and improve the right of leaseholder but he will be aware that part of the bill look to protect and improve the right of family who hold the freehold of their property against the estate management charge about which he be speak the bill do lot to meet some of the request of many of my conservative colleague on this matter one issue that be not address in the bill however be the right to manage in the response to the consultation the government say they would look at that and introduce legislation what be the current government think on give people the right to manage and therefore to take back control from the estate management company my hon friend make good point be go to say there be two other area in particular that we should look at in committee the right to manage and the abuse of forfeiture which be sometimes use by freeholder to intimidate leaseholder be very open to improve the bill in committee we will be improve it ourselves by bring forward the legislation that will ban new leasehold home in the future so hope we will have chance to do that mention early that we have be debate leasehold and freehold in this place for long time in the preparation of this bill one of the brilliant civil servant in the department draw to my attention comment make by harry levy lawson viscount burnham and mp for st pancras as it happen when the leasehold enfranchisement bill be bring forward by another great reform conservative government under the marquess of salisbury hear hear exactly the minister be like great fan of the marquess in that debate the open remark of the minister be we do not claim for this bill any perfection of draftsmanship but it be so far complete that if it pass through parliament we believe it would be smooth just and reliable in its working the principle however be now exactly what it have always be viz the grant to urban leaseholder with substantial interest in their holding of the power to purchase the fee simple the ownership on fair and equitable term official report may vol this bill do so much more be it perfect no would not claim for this bill any perfection of draftsmanship be it substantive do it move the dial do it change the business model will it effectively mean that leasehold will become thing of the past believe absolutely it will and be fortify in that belief by the strong support for this legislation show by leasehold campaigner commend the bill to the house it be pleasure to open this debate on behalf of the opposition let say at the outset that we do not intend to oppose the bill today simply it be well late than never may associate myself with the secretary of state comment at the start of the debate because many people have contribute and campaign on this issue over the year that it have be speak about many have long need this overdue bill and they need it to be improve leaseholder across the country have be wait for year six year to be exact to see the government flagship bill to end leasehold and to break free the million of people trap in what the secretary of state himself describe as feudal and absurd system of home ownership if this be the secretary of state go in hurry would hate to see his normal pace it be back in that his fifth predecessor as housing secretary pledge action he talk good talk today and he be theatrical love the passion it be really there and love the squeeze we want to see the squeeze but frankly have lose count of the number of time ministers have promise to finally put britain in line with other develop country across the world that have all end this medieval system to be fair to the secretary of state none of they have say it be an assault on leasehold and squeeze on income so he be go little bit far but after all that time and all those promise and after that theatrical squeeze we still have bill that do not actually abolish leasehold suppose that that be no surprise as it come alongside bill that pledge to ban section no fault eviction that do not ban no fault eviction and bill to stop the small boat that do not stop the small boat it be all well and good for the secretary of state to say that the government plan to amend the bill in the usual way but be it too much to ask for the government to include clause that ban leasehold in bill whose stated purpose be to ban leasehold why make those promise only to produce bill that do no such thing in word it sound like chaos even the day before it be publish the department press release say that the bill would ban developer from sell new house under leasehold give the tiny proportion of leasehold that be house rather than flat it be hardly an ambitious pledge but the bill do not even introduce that ban do my right hon friend agree with what say to the secretary of state the government could have stop this if they have not do the help to buy scheme which fuel this practice among large developer they could have stop it in its track if they have stop the finance to those company do she also agree that expectation have be raise among lot of the leaseholder who be put into the trap of their house be leasehold they think they be go to get out of that trap when actually they be not absolutely agree with my right hon friend the government have be in government for year we have have six year of these promise and he be absolutely right that there be more than one way that the government could have ensure that leaseholder be not treat in this way the botched drafting of the bill mean we be still wait to see single clause that prohibit single new leasehold property whether it be flat or house it be on january this year that the secretary of state promise my predecessor my hon friend the member for wigan lisa nandy we will maintain our commitment to abolish the feudal system of leasehold we absolutely will we will bring forward legislation shortly official report january vol in february he say he aim in the forthcoming king speech to introduce legislation to fundamentally reform the system to end this feudal form of report february vol in may the then housing minister tell this house that my department be work flat report may vol on the legislation if it have take they this long with not word to show for it can they guarantee that they will put their amendment to the house by january next year full month after the secretary of state promise at the dispatch box we have hear the secretary of state say that it be perfectly normal to bring forward vast swathe of amendment in committee believe the committee will be do some considerable heavy lifting have shadow he through the final stage of the levelling up and regeneration bill would say that perhaps he do think that make endless last minute amendment to his own bills be normal way of legislating but the anonymous source close to the secretary of state may have let the cat out of the bag about the real reason the bill be so empty when they brief the press last month we know from they what he can not admit today the prime minister be block this bill from the king speech in the face of lobby from vested interest oppose the reform in the chaos of this government it be add only at the very last minute we may have hear many warm word and the secretary of state be very theatrical about his ambition for reform but he be stick in the daily tory doom loop in which vested interest always come before the national interest the truth be that the time waste and backtrack all go back to the prime minister desperate attempt to extend the lease on no downing street the fact be that even if the government belatedly fix their leasehold house loophole flat owner will be leave out of the picture yet of all leasehold property be flat and there be over more owner occupy leasehold flat than house in england have listen to the secretary of state those owner will still be wonder just when the government will fulfil their pledge to they as be sure everyone in the house will agree property law be by nature extremely complex but we can not and must not lose sight of the daily impact that these law have on the life of million across our country include over million owner of leasehold property in england and wales be sure that most of we in the house know what that mean in human term for our constituent for most freehold homeowner ownership mean security and control yet for far too many leaseholder the reality of home ownership fall woefully short of the dream they be promise too many leaseholder face constant struggle with punitive and ever rise ground rent rent for home that they actually own in exchange for which the freeholder need to do nothing at all leaseholder be lock into expensive agreement and face unjustified administration fee and extortionate charge condition be impose with little or no consultation for leaseholder also affect by the building safety crisis the situation be even bad the right hon lady have make it clear from the dispatch box that she oppose excessive ground rent can she explain why the labour leader make it clear at the labour party conference that he would get new house build by create attractive investment product that have residential ground rent at their heart how can it possibly be the case that she intend to deal with excessive ground rent when the leader of the labour party want to fund new development by pursue precisely that policy which be it against they or for they thank the secretary of state but he have just use the word excessive if he want to let deal with this problem be happy to take over and show that be not just about theatrical performance at the dispatch box will actually deal with it he have be give year on the government benches and have fail to do that this bill still fail to do that so would like to see where he will deal with this issue regulation of freeholder have fall behind that of landlord leave leaseholder strip of the right enjoy even by tenant in the private rent sector perhaps the secretary of state can tell we what measure exist that prevent the bad actor in the market from repeatedly rip off leaseholder in one place after another my right hon friend be make strong speech and she accurately describe the mental and financial anguish that have be feel by many leaseholder in my constituency she be absolutely right in my constituency this issue predominantly affect those in flat not in leasehold house and what they have go through with service charge and fire and building safety remediation have take toll on many of they they have find themselves in despair do she agree that much more need to be do to deal with manage agent on the transparency of service fee it be good to hear the secretary of state mention firstport and hope to meet it soon but do she agree that this be much wide problem that need to be address absolutely agree as say before and as think the secretary of state acknowledge there be lot of work to be do in committee on these issue hopefully we will be able to help the secretary of state improve his own bill which need significant improvement suspect that my right hon friend will welcome the strengthening of the regulation of management company in the bill but we need to go far just last friday have some heartbreaking conversation with resident on the froghall fields estate in flitwick lovely part of the world with which be sure many member will be familiar from the by election who have be leave brutally expose to successive fail management company by ongoing adoption conversation with the council that be drag on and on do my right hon friend agree that there be more we can do to strengthen the propose regulation in this area to ensure that my long suffer resident finally get the redress and resolution they deserve absolutely agree with my hon friend be so pleased about the work he have be do since he be elect to this place and the way in which he have be real champion of his constituent which they do not feel they have previously he make really important point and he be right to point out the huge problem of estate agent charge and fee the step the government be take to address the issue be welcome of course but we absolutely believe there be room to improve the measure in the bill the shadow housing minister my hon friend the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook will look to do so in committee follow on from that point when the select committee look at this issue it be real problem we say that whenever property be sell the purchaser or leaseholder and in some case the freeholder should have right at the beginning to see precisely what the agreement be between the local authority and the developer about where responsibility for ongoing maintenance of the estate and so forth rest many purchaser simply do not know who to go to and who be responsible it would be helpful if that be set out very clearly at the beginning of the purchase absolutely agree and congratulate my hon friend on his fabulous work in this area transparency be incredibly important because it be the first step towards get accountability we speak before about pet we all love our pet and the secretary of state have rightly protect the reasonable right of tenant to keep pet yet it be not clear whether he intend to extend that right to leaseholder have see lease that contain an outright ban so hope he ensure that the bill reflect that it be just one example of the restriction that term in lease increasingly impose but could cite many more for example basic modification or decoration to flat or the right to conduct business from home know that some government members may not be keen on work from home but it be quite another thing to say that someone could lose their home over it they might be more sympathetic if point out the impact on the self employ who be often ban from run their own business from their own home there be basic principle at stake for the opposition and hope the whole house can agree that people right to bring up family to care for love family pet to own and run their own business and to pay fair price and receive what they have pay for be basic british right and value the incredible thing be that they be be deny to people in their very own home home that they own that be surely at the heart of today debate because for leaseholder their flat or house be not an investment it be their home place to live to grow up to grow old to raise family to get on in life and to be part of community home be more than brick and mortar it be about security and have power over your own life as leaseholder someone may have ownership but not control the dream of home ownership have already slip away from far too many but it be less of dream and more of nightmare for too many who now achieve it from what the secretary of state have say there be some agreement between we on the problem those people face but the content of the bill do not quite match up to his sentiment or the energy that he bring to the dispatch box so hope that in wind up the minister will not just tell we exactly how far the bill address the problem raise today but accept that we can work together in later stage to go far this be point that want to make to the secretary of state as well there be long stand injustice for leaseholder who experience flooding as they currently do not have access to the flood re scheme will my right hon friend seek hope she will to ensure level playing field for leaseholder and freeholder in access the flood re scheme thank my hon friend for that just as the secretary of state early bring enthusiasm to the dispatch box on cladding and some issue we face there hope that in committee we can explore that and the effect on people who have be affect more and more by flooding the secretary of state may not have the support of his prime minister or his back many of they be not here at the moment watch this space on the labour benches we be unite behind the decisive action that leaseholder need if the government can not deliver it we be ready to do so labour government will make commonhold the default tenure for all new property as part of our commitment to fundamentally and comprehensively reform the leasehold system we will also enact the law commission recommendation on enfranchisement commonhold and the right to manage in full the fact be unless and until leaseholder of house and flat get renew commitment from ministers on all the law commission recommendation leaseholder will reasonably conclude that the government have scale down their ambition with the scale back bill before we leaseholder deserve to know the real reason why they be be fob off with such limited step unfortunately the answer as ever lie in the chaos of this government the secretary of state have talk good game but he might be the only functional cog in dysfunctional government there be compliment in there be try laughter hope that he will face down his prime minister and his own back benchers and accept labour proposal to make the bill meet the challenge of the moment but if he do not labour government will call the father of the house the house will be grateful to know that the official opposition support what the government be try to do pay tribute as the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner and my right hon friend the secretary of state do to the people in the all party parliamentary group on leasehold and commonhold reform liberals labour conservatives and other who over the last year have work together to try to get to situation where it be not possible for freeholder on purpose or by mistake to exploit residential leaseholder when first speak on this issue about year ago declare my interest as leaseholder in my constituency with no problem whatsoever six of we buy the freehold willingly from willing seller the person who develop the block of flat when he retire have since acquire an interest in another leasehold property do not take part in these debate to try to feather my own nest be try to ensure that the million people who be in bad position have as good an experience as have have it be year since first start quote leasehold knowledge partnership in addition to sebastian and martin boyd whom the secretary of state refer to as well as the campaigner in the national leasehold campaign would like to name one or two journalist who have help in particular the people at the people who have bat away at the issue major medium organisation ought to have housing correspondent or editor rather than put it with home affair we can not expect mark easton at the bbc when he cover the home office to be able to become expert in residential leasehold in the way that be need hope that in committee and especially in the house of lords the part of the law commission recommendation that have not be incorporate in the bill will be put forward for decision by the house and the other place the three report that it produce in should be implement in full or else when those report come out the government should have say what be wrong with the proposal may emphasise what the secretary of state say about the ongoing consultation and continue conversation on modern leasehold the ground rent issue where the period of consultation have be extend from think late december to the middle of january people will be grateful for that there be five option as dean buckner trustee of lkp the campaign charity have say those who own freehold interest have know since scotland abolish leasehold that the gravy train be go to end when the government come forward with the proposal that ground rent should not be more than of the capital value they know that their value be not as high as some be estimate and when people start look at the discount rate think in the impact assessment it be about in fact long term debt for the government be now at see that that again will reduce it make the suggestion which be also on the lkp website that the government can deal with any possible compensation by say that they will tax it at or high which will make attempt by people to take it to judicial review or challenge to the government on human right term null and void or at least not worth try may say to the government that after the grenfell fire tragedy while it become clear that up to billion of remediation be need not just for cladding but for other fire defect and that the only people who could eventually pay those cost by law would be the leaseholder who own not brick in the building the people who ought to be pay be the insurer for those who be responsible the designer the architect the builder the developer the subcontractor the component manufacturer and the like they be all insure commend to the house that in committee it should somehow be write into the bill that potential claim by leaseholder be gather together in an agency which could sue the insurance company and those they insure to get contribution from they that would reduce the cost both to leaseholder and to the government who have be provide lot of money to try to ensure that remediation have happen pay tribute to successive secretaries of state who have have to give write instruction to their permanent secretary for some of the compensation for fire defect cost and say to the government that the artificial distinction of metre be unjustified actually fire death certificate show that more people die in fire in low building and high building be not risky we ought to try to recognise the reality it be also worth say in pass that when dame judith hackitt produce her report and recommendation do not think she be well brief on the law on leasehold which be why some of her recommendation be not properly appropriate be glad that since gavin barwell we have have succession of ministers who have put the government on the side of leaseholder we now know that there be million to million of they thank my hon friend for what he be say do he agree that at some stage or other these unsafe building be sign off as fit and proper building under building regulation and that leaseholder also have valid claim against the individual who sign they off who be also insure agree with my hon friend and pay tribute to he for his work in this field it be worth note that building standard be set not by those who sign building off the building control people but by the government or quasi government agency so the government bear some responsibility as well as think they recognise in my thank want to include katherine who have help the secretariat of the all party group and work remarkably well give that my involvement as an active campaigner on this matter come through constituency case pay tribute to my senior caseworker colette hanson who for many year over decade have help to support constituent face awful problem whether on this matter or other the secretary of state refer to james brokenshire who carry forward many leasehold reform also thank sir nigel shadbolt and sir tim berners lee and their open data institute for provide help to lkp the campaign charity in get information that be publicly available and put it together so that we could know the scale of the problem that we be face pay tribute to the law commissioner professor nick hopkins and his team for their programme of law reform also pay tribute to wendy wilson at the house of commons library who have since leave and hannah cromarty who have produce briefing for members of parliament which commend to those outside this building if they look at the house of commons research and the lkp site they will be as knowledgeable as and will put across these point as effectively or more so over and again want to emphasise that people must respond to the government very good consultation on ground rent it be well write and bring out the issue properly would be surprised if the dominant view be anything other than that ground rent should be reduce to peppercorn at one stage the government suggest bring it down to but that still leave most of the superstructure and the problem with leaseholder it should be bring down to peppercorn to eliminate those when the consultation be analyse ask the secretary of state to look with favour on reduce ground rent to zero if get any benefit will give it to good cause but be not say this for could go on at length and at some stage probably will have make my preliminary remark want to say to the house that this be the opportunity before general election whoever win to get legislation through that may be complicated in law but not in politic be we on the side of the people who have be at risk or exploit by interest who have own freehold have give my list of past shame and will not trouble the house with it now if people have problem with their landlord or freeholder they should tell their member of parliament so that they can bring it up in committee or on report suggest that those who have use expensive lawyer to screw residential leaseholder use their money on something else when notable charity use expensive lawyer to raise the cost of enfranchisement or lease extension by third an issue that should have come to parliament rather than be do in the privacy of an upper property tribunal we know that those run charity can get it wrong too we have leave this too long let we now get on with it call the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee generally welcome what be in the bill as do the select committee base on our inquiry it be what be not in the bill that be disappointing that be the difference let go back to our report which build on the work of the appg congratulate the father of the house the hon member for worthe west sir peter bottomley and my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders who be now shadow minister on their work that report lead to the work of the competition and markets authority on mis selling and the law commission report want to go through some of the select committee recommendation and what the government have follow through on which we welcome also want to look at the matter omit from the legislation which could easily be add in committee if the government want to leasehold flat be more complicated and they will probably not be add to the bill in committee the select committee accept the complication particularly where property be part commercial part residential however our report be four year ago which be long time for the secretary of state to work up scheme to deal with leasehold flat but we be not there in the meantime hope that he will commit to the committee recommendation for programme of education and information for leaseholder to ensure well understanding of what commonhold be all about there be lack of understanding and information and if we be to move to commonhold for new property and encourage leaseholder in exist property to convert that programme be need the legislation deal primarily with leasehold house we welcome the commitment to no new leasehold house or we will when the clause be add to the bill we understand that that be for committee we welcome the commitment to remove onerous ground rent the select committee look in detail at the argument about the european convention on human right do my hon friend agree that the bill do not address issue associate with the growth in leasehold house over the last few year early mention persimmon which have leave lot of resident with lease that include not only their own property but common area traditionally when my hon friend and be in local government those would have be take over by local authority there be real issue with that which be go to address later but will do so now it be important to strengthen the right to manage both for leaseholder and for freeholder in these estate who own the freehold of their house but not of the communal area say early that in all property purchase where common area remain in private ownership there should be at the point of purchase clear understanding of the agreement between the local authority and the developer about who be responsible for those common area in many circumstance it be simply opaque often purchaser do not know who be responsible and be send on wild goose chase to find out once they have buy their property return to onerous ground rent the select committee take counsel opinion which be quite interesting and make recommendation in paragraph to of our report there be two clear argument why remove onerous ground rent from lease retrospectively be completely compatible with the european convention on human right the first which most of we may not have think about be that control or change rent be not confiscation of property but control of its use so it do not conflict with the article on remove people property right secondly the convention include justification where the proposal have wider beneficial impact on society which can be offset against any impact on the property owner counsel opinion be that it be therefore perfectly justifiable under the european convention to remove onerous ground rent on exist property my hon friend will remember that when the labour government overturn the case of custins hearts of oak in they use exactly those ground to justify do so do remember that far back many will not remember the labour government reform but they be quite important on those ground absolutely other good aspect of the bill include its reduce the price of enfranchisement and try to make it simple now be not sure that it make it simple it be still bit complicated in the end it partly depend on the capitalisation rate that the government introduce which will determine the price but lot of my constituent who be leaseholder live in house and they often face enormous barrier to carry through the enfranchisement process have refer to coppen estates in my constituency which be notorious for simply not reply to letter once get it to reply to record letter at the third time of ask normally it ignore everything that be just its way of try to hang on to its ground rent and its income from lease how will we deal with those sort of individual and company and the fact that they transfer ownership around from one company to another why be there no right of first refusal for leaseholder in the bill be pleased that some year ago sheffield council agree that when it sell freehold the right of first refusal would go to the leaseholder that would be simple reform and hope the secretary of state will consider it the improvement of the enfranchisement process to make it simple and reduce the cost be right but would like further improvement to ensure that it will work welcome the standardisation of service charge one big complaint to the committee be that leaseholder often simply do not know what they be pay and why they can not work out which service be suppose to be provide and which be not that be an important step forward on commission fee we hear about the to change doorbell and the to put up conservatory complete rip off there be no justification for they in house in particular and very little justification in flat be pleased that freeholder will now have to provide schedule of rate that will be charge we call for cap on rate which might have take reform little far but at least there now have to be clarity and transparency also welcome the clause that mean leaseholder will not end up pay for the legal and other cost of freeholder where there be any conflict or dispute number of other measure have be omit from the bill but they could be include very easily the secretary of state mention forfeiture if leasehold be feudal tenure then forfeiture be prehistoric it really be if leaseholder in very small way fail to comply with an element of their lease they could have the property take off they that be just unacceptable and unjustifiable the secretary of state be right in what he say forfeiture be not necessarily something that get use but the threat of its being use put the onus on leaseholder to behave or do what the freeholder want they to do the removal of that with simple clause would be really welcome should have include the hon gentleman and the select committee in my thank and do so belatedly on forfeiture we could ban it completely although there may be time when it be necessary to have an order to sell property to pay debt the limit should be raise from to significant figure such as and any remain equity should go back to the person who own the lease and not be pocket by the freeholder the father of the house make very reasonable point my point be simply that forfeiture be currently blanket possibility that can apply to any breach of lease however minor and non payment of very small amount could cost the leaseholder the total of the value of their property that be what we have to stop why do freeholder not have to join redress scheme the committee call for they to be include in the redress scheme the secretary of state be bring in number of redress scheme and ombudsman extension so why can freeholder not be include one of the big issue raise with we where again there be lack of transparency be that many leaseholder have to pay into reserve fund sink fund for their property can we not have some protection for those fund formally write into law currently many leaseholder have no idea what the money be be spend on there be no obligation on the freeholder to explain it and certainly no protection that fund have to be use for the purpose for which they be pay on mis selling one of the big complaint we hear when we meet leaseholder this relate to house in particular persimmon homes have be mention but there be other developer too be the fact that they be be sell leasehold as though it be the same as freehold the solicitor be compliant in that because they have be recommend by the developer often bonus be throw in we give you new carpet in the living room if you use that solicitor the competition and markets authority investigate at our request and say there be mis selling but so far nothing have be do about it the government have do absolutely nothing to rectify that injustice can we not see something on that again do not think that there be any great conflict across the house or between anyone who have be involve in this matter it be wrong absolutely wrong solicitor should not be induce in this way to provide conveyancing to purchaser when the developer be recommend that solicitor it simply be not right and it need address my final point be one that we raise on the private rent reform that the government will hopefully pursue and hopefully this year come rather than wait any long with regard to section we have call repeatedly for housing court know the secretary of state will explain again why he do not want to do that but think we ought to keep ask there be so many issue in the housing field that need specialism and need quick decision and quick resolution housing court would be one way of do that and of try to improve the process one thing think so many leaseholder find frustrating with our current court system and the first tier tribunal be that they do not set precedent so even if we identify something with freeholder who may have multiple thousand of property every single individual have to go through the process if they be not party to the original case do my hon friend agree that specialist housing court could at least have precedent build in that be an extremely good point do not think the select committee actually make that point but it add to its recommendation in very thoughtful and helpful way there be lot of issue and be sure we will not resolve all of they in today debate but they need to be address in committee there be reform to the propose legislation that could be make most of they quite easily the big issue of leasehold flat be for another day but it ought to be keep on the agenda welcome what be in the bill which could be the basis for much improve piece of legislation perhaps we will see an improved bill come back to we on report be delighted to speak on this flagship piece of legislation which will restore true home ownership to million end rip off charge and introduce fairness to the leasehold market be confident that it be good piece of legislation not because do all the preparatory work on it but because work with brilliant official whom thank we hear the testimony of so many thousand of leaseholder who struggle with blighted property that lead to blighted life there be too many of they to mention individually but the strength and tenacity of the campaigner and the organisation such as the leasehold knowledge partnership and the leasehold advisory service under the leadership of the superb martin boyd which help they be enormously impressive take for example liam spender who be able to show that leaseholder in his block have pay million in excess service charge to their freeholder firstport incidentally firstport be one of the bad offender hear about in my time as minister yet freeholder still have the audacity to sit in front of while be minister and claim that some people like the security of pay service charge and that there be no evidence that they oppose ground rent yes truly that be what they say shockingly understand that mr spender and his tenant have receive nothing yet and now the freeholder be appeal the decision with the leaseholder own money would like the minister to set out clearly how the bill will tackle their situation and end that scandal once and for all we get here because of the greed and unethical behaviour of predatory freeholder who have treat leasehold property as cash cow and the leaseholder as milk machine to produce an endless stream of income for no work at all it be the ultimate definition of rent seek behaviour in its bad excess it be frankly disgusting and many other find it appal on the case that liam spender have so rightly be pursue for his fellow leaseholder do my hon friend think it would be good idea if the select committee consider invite in the people he have be engage with to ask why they do not put their hand up straightaway settle and give back all the money they wrongly take from leaseholder without have to have extend legal proceeding that be an excellent suggestion from my hon friend the father of the house with which strongly agree as do with everything he say about this issue despite the theatric we hear from the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner who speak for the opposition it be the conservatives who be finally bring in sweeping reform it be right that we note that labour duck the issue while they be in office they could have fix it then they could have save million from misery nearly million home account for of the entire housing market be own on leasehold basis across the uk but it appear they bow to pressure from freeholder we will never know why but thankfully thing will now change the hon lady may not remember but do that before the commonhold and leasehold reform act be pass great deal of pressure have be apply since at that stage however their lordship down at the other end of the building threaten to block all of labour legislation if we insist on put through some of the measure that be ultimately take out of that bill the hon lady be right those measure should have be include lobby and campaign for they to be include and make my speech in the house accordingly but their lordship be in the majority and at the time of their lordship have declare in the register of interests that they derive most of their income from the management of land thank the hon member for the history lesson but regardless we be determined to fix this now will the hon lady give way no because need to make progress perhaps will allow the right hon gentleman to intervene little later the key factor here be choice at present leaseholder do not have choice or they have fake choice the bill will give they genuine choice when it come to how they manage and own their home however while warmly welcome these measure we can and must go far may draw the attention of the secretary of state and the minister to few of my suggestion the measure in the bill will clearly be of enormous benefit to individual leaseholder make it easy and cheap for they to buy freehold or extend lease but of course this be very complicated area and know it will be difficult for many leaseholder to understand exactly how much they will benefit financially my first suggestion therefore be the provision of an easy to use digital calculator enable people to see what the bill mean for they then there be the issue of commonhold fix know that the focus here be on ensure that leaseholder can not be exploit and can take control of their home but there be clear conservative and free market rationale for accept the law commission recommendation on reform commonhold so that more developer choose it rather than leasehold for new block of flat not because they be force to do so but because it be the good option for their business model can the government look at that again all the work have already be do strongly welcome the government consultation on cap ground rent as say in an intervention early the secretary of state must look at who be make the representation and bear in mind the old adage they would say that would they when people oppose such cap we know that ground rent be sheer exploitation let we call spade spade this be money for nothing can the minister assure that there will be time to get cap into the bill once the consultation have close we have all hear of too many sad case involve hard core of truly exploitative and dodgy freeholder the bad apple rip off and exploit leaseholder we know that there be some freeholder who treat people properly but the other know that go to court will be too much hassle for most people and indeed that the odd tribunal defeat be just part of the cost of do business we must do something to ensure that there be real cost to those unscrupulous company and their director thank the hon member for the work that she have be do on this issue however she imply that the rip off merchant constitute only certain proportion of freeholder be she not aware that these people have be work in cahoot over the past year attend conference identify the weakness in the law share information and form link with professional such as agent and solicitor in order to rip off innocent leaseholder this be consistent organise scam that have be grow over year which be why there be so many more problem now than there be say or year ago of course be aware of that when be privileged to hold the position of housing minister strongly support the relevant legislation because those people sit in front of and cry crocodile tear tell that if we go ahead with it we would destabilise the pension industry and leave lot of little old lady with no pension which be obviously complete and utter nonsense as be sure the secretary of state and the current housing minister my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire lee rowley will be able to tell on the basis of the analysis that they have conduct we also need assurance about section manager note that in recent week at least one freeholder have try to wrest control of building back from court appoint manager so call section manager claim that it be incompatible with the building safety act that be obviously nonsense if freeholder have be find not to be manage his building properly it show some cheek to try to ditch court appointee on such spurious ground hope that the minister will take the opportunity later to give we the government view welcome the government intention of introduce build safety measure to ensure that remediation continue to accelerate and to make it easy to ensure that the right people pay but may press the minister for little more detail know that even as we speak people be make serious decision about their own finance my constituent in brockhill especially those in the persimmon homes development have face innumerable issue relate to freehold estate and must press the minister on what measure he will introduce to help they and most importantly when he will do so know that the government intend to introduce right to manage for freeholder and to challenge arrangement and charge through the first tier property tribunal however urge he to read again the hansard report of the westminster hall debate in which respond on behalf of the government to my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller who have tell story about one of his constituent who have have to pay thousand of pound for one lamp post this be an outrageous state of affair and want the government to introduce measure that will tackle it and many other currently throughout the country people new dream home be turn out to be nightmare they be be rip off by small print clause that turn into big bill and they have no redress that must be fix finally there be need for regulation of the property management sector more broadly recognise that the bill be not the right vehicle for it but urge the minister to continue to push ahead with reform that must happen if not on this side of general election then on the other side we conservative believe that the opportunity to own one home be sacrosanct and the bill take another important stride towards the creation of true property own democracy while as we have make clear we stand firmly on the side of fairness and those who want to own home we be still none the wiser when it come to where labour member stand one week they be on the side of the builder not the blocker or so they say the next week they be block our proposal to build new home that first time buyer and young family would desperately want to possess while they decide whose side they be on we be take important step to improve the life of million up and down the country look forward to work with ministers on the bill as it go through the house to strengthen some of its measure particularly those on commonhold and freehold estate and to ensure that we deliver on the promise that it hold let end by wish my hon friend the minister well luck than have in his tenure of this important role especially hope that he can remain to finish the vital job of leasehold and freehold reform and restore true property ownership to million he will have my full support in the lobbies be pleased to follow the hon member for redditch rachel maclean the former housing minister and congratulate she on her work in this regard be disappoint that she choose to adopt rather partisan tone in some of her remark unnecessarily think but be grateful for the more generous tone take by the secretary of state especially welcome his generous and appropriate tribute to our former colleague jim fitzpatrick for his work in the all party parliamentary group be glad that he be mention let begin by identify specific concern that the bill have raise be aware of it because of the work that the work and pensions committee have do on asbestos under the control of asbestos regulations premise can be sell while contain asbestos ownership can be transfer asbestos management be regulate in relation to workplace where it be the responsibility of the health and safety executive but not in domestic property in lot of share dwelling such as flat and conversion the landlord or freeholder have regulate duty under the exist regulation to manage asbestos in the share area in those development this legislation as understand it may well give rise to the transfer of those obligation to domestic owner the existence and extent of asbestos in building might not be know leave homeowner take on these responsibility with hidden liability and potentially life threaten risk to handle as well homeowner be unlikely to have the wherewithal to manage asbestos in situ effectively and this could leave complex set of responsibility and liability between owner in share property or where the nominal landlord no long exist at the moment there be tax relief for business remove asbestos from workplace they can offset it against corporation tax but there be no support for homeowner to remove or manage asbestos it have be suggest to this be something be look at that there should be an amendment propose that change in ownership of property in the circumstance envisage in the bill or change in the extent of landlord control should be trigger for remove asbestos otherwise more asbestos will move outside effective control under this legislation mean that nobody will be responsible for manage it and potentially create significant public health risk will focus the rest of my remark on part of the bill and draw attention to some particular instance that have arise in my constituency my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner in open the debate rightly express the disappointment of many that the more radical ambition for the bill have be drop at least for the time being but there be lot of practical problem for our constituent that need address and that the bill can potentially help with the minister for housing planning and building safety who be in his place be aware of barrier point in my constituency which comprise eight tower and apartment tower the large of the tower have apartment and flammable cladding problem in building insurance for the whole of barrier point cost last year aviva which insure the block previously refuse to quote so this year resident have end up pay for insurance and tower resident have shoulder that huge increase at cost of between and each be grateful both to aviva and to barratt which build the development for meet resident to try to find way forward be also grateful to the minister for the interest he have show in this and for his agree to visit hope we will have date for that soon can see that the bill could go some way towards tackle those problem particularly welcome clause and which increase transparency around service charge and give occupant the right to obtain information about service charge and cost on request clause and will help tenant to enforce those right and rebalance the cost of litigation in their favour the financial conduct authority report on insurance for multi occupancy building find that commission be often at least on transaction and it find one case where it be over the fca be worried that insurance commission lack transparency and it fear the conflict of interest that stem from broker regularly share half their commission with the freeholder or manage agent replace commission with transparent handling fee as clause and envisage should certainly help appreciate everything that my right hon friend be say he will be aware though that many company hold freehold will also set up an arm length company that be the broker thus take double take in term of the commission it be not just that they get cut from the broker they be the broker my hon friend make an important point and welcome his work in this area over long period the change in the bill be not likely to do much to help the resident of barrier point who have exercise their right to manage the fca have argue that the intervention most likely to reduce price for the minority of multi occupancy building with the most substantial price increase would be cross industry risk pooling be pleased to hear from the secretary of state in answer to my intervention that he will be meet representative of the association of british insurers this week the abi initiative on this issue appear up to now to have stall the fca recommend that the abi should work with it and with the government to introduce risk pool scheme in the scheme be expect to come forward last summer but we be still wait be hop that as result of the meeting this week that the secretary of state have tell we about thing will get move check with the fca last week about this it say that the abi plan be credible and capable of deliver saving to those bad affected building but it go on to add that the plan be delay with no firm launch date because the abi be struggle to secure the reinsurance capacity require that seem to be the obstacle very much hope that the secretary of state can find way to push this forward at his meeting the abi urge the government to increase capacity by back catastrophic loss in the scheme it do that most recently in june can the minister tell we whether that appeal have be consider by the department and whether that might be take forward at the meeting with the secretary of state later this week when do he think risk pooling will commence on remediation there be power imbalance between leaseholder and freeholder that have be highlight to by barrier point resident the bill do not really address that section of the building safety act make right to manage company the accountable person for high risk multi occupancy building make the director criminally liable if negligence can be prove the same act however require only that freeholder co operate with accountable person without any enforcement mechanism in place at all the freeholder at barrier point have hold up remediation work for several month and be refuse to sign off on they the director of the right to manage company desperately want to fulfil their legal obligation but they be leave liable because of the refusal of the freeholder to say okay and there be no comparable liability on the freeholder that seem wrong and wonder whether that imbalance can be address in the course of the bill passage through the house the minister say in oral question just last week that the government plan to make change to the bill as it go through parliament and hope he will consider how that imbalance can be address to ensure that remediation work can go ahead in case such as that which suspect be by no mean unique the resident of barrier point want to purchase their freehold to do so they need to get at least of all the leaseholder to agree to and be able to afford freehold purchase that be very difficult in building with household do not think the bill do anything to make that process easy so very much hope that ministers will be open to further improvement as it progress through the house my speech will be brief as want to concentrate on one aspect of the bill estate management company be massive and grow issue in my dartford constituency some new home have be build in my constituency over the last year and they be predominantly look after by management company welcome the measure in the bill that will rightly allow resident to challenge the invoice and bill they be send by management company this will help to transfer some of the power back to resident by give they tool to say this invoice be unfair this bill be not right or these account be not right it be absolutely right that power be transfer away from management company and into the hand of local resident because at the moment management company seem to do pretty much whatever they like they can put up the charge they levy on resident way above inflation while provide very poor service and local resident can do very little about it local resident find themselves completely restrict in challenge what be on occasion hideously poor service with extortionate fee they be tread on by the management company of course resident question why they have to pay council tax at the same time as pay management fee as they often find that their management fee be use to pay for say play park that the whole community can use for free they have to pay for it they have to pay for the maintenance and they have to pay council tax too which seem very unfair in my experience local resident want to be able to change their management company they want to be able to switch over and to say to their management company no you have not provide good enough service you be charge we too much money and therefore we be go to use different management company if that happen it will help to tackle most of the problem we be experience with management company it will end the monopoly by return competition to the system enable the good management company to prevail and the poor one to fall by the wayside the whole house will accept that my hon friend be rightly argue for total transparency there ought to be open book accounting by these manage agent so that those who be pay can see what be happen do my hon friend agree that the amalgamation of manage agent be dangerous trend it mean that the choice be reduce not increase give that some manage agent be very large and people experience of they be not very good we ought to try to make sure that there be not this continual amalgamation and that there be good choice of good manage agent that want to earn well reputation the father of the house make very good point would like to see co operation between company rather than amalgamation in my constituency we often see two management company send two people to mow the grass on the same estate resident look out of their window and see the grass on one side of the estate be mow by one company and the grass on the other side of the estate be mow by different company of course they have to pay twice for that pleasure if the company co operate that situation would not arise some of the people attend my surgery be there to complain about management company even constituent of the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook come to my surgery with two of my constituent hasten to add to raise issue about management company she be very complimentary of the hon gentleman by the way but put she straight however she be not very complimentary about the management company that she be suffer from this problem happen in greenwich in dartford and across the country and we need this bill to get to grip with it be the hon gentleman aware that management fee slowly go up in some retirement village and retirement complex old people do not challenge they and it end up make their flat either unsellable or worth less than they pay the right hon gentleman make an excellent point and it highlight how management fee undermine the whole housing sector we will end up in situation where people do not want to buy nice home because of the management company that operate on these estate it undermine freehold because people live on these estate have to go to the management company to get an information pack in order to sell their home of course the information pack do not come free on most estate in my constituency people have to pay the management company effectively to ask for permission to sell their house lady contact and apart from the cost some of the information in her information pack be wrong when she contact the management company to ask some question about the information it have provide she be tell that each question would be charge at plus vat but this be the management company fault not her that be just one example could give thousand of just how horrifically some management company behave the bill need to deal with these organisation the hon gentleman be make some excellent point be he aware that some company manage residential property for the elderly charge of the property sale price which they take to themselves for the privilege of allow it to be sell have hear of those kind of thing the same happen with park home and we be also try to tackle that it be only right that we tackle this issue with management company because it totally undermine the concept of freehold the secretary of state rightly say that he support home ownership yet we have system that undermine the principle of home ownership people buy these house in my constituency because they be nice home in nice area and they often buy they in seller market they be literally stand in queue with other people wait behind they to buy the same property if they have not sign on the dotted line there and then there be plenty of people behind they who would have they sign without full appreciation of the term of the contract which effectively say that the management company can put up its management fee way beyond inflation and there be nothing that can be do about it echo the father of the house as we consider the bill throughout its passage member have to decide which side we be on be we on the side of the management company or be we on the side of local resident it should be no brainer for every member of the house and hope we will come together after the bill get its second reading be sure we would all like to see some amendment in committee it be pleasure to follow the hon member for dartford gareth johnson he be absolutely right about management company need more transparency and more accountability today second reading of the leasehold and freehold reform bill be long overdue for my battersea constituent many be trap in the exploitative leasehold system which deny they control safety security and future in their home unfortunately the bill fall short of what the secretary of state commit to when he say that the government will maintain our commitment to abolish the system of leasehold we absolutely will official report january vol this be yet another broken promise by the tories we all know that everyone deserve to live in safe decent and affordable home and that mean abolish the unfair and outdated leasehold system in london alone leasehold account for more than of home some of home sell in battersea in be leasehold transaction make battersea the high constituency in the country for leasehold so this bill really matter to the people of my constituency have be in this house for only six and half year and we have debate leasehold reform continuously indeed we have pass legislation by way of the fire safety act and the building safety act which follow the awful awful tragedy at grenfell tower however we know that even with all that legislation and despite all these debate the system be still flawed and not all leaseholder be protect in england and wales our approach have not be in keep with that of the rest of the world because many country have choose to do away with this feudal system or have reform it we be still in this state of stalemate the law commission proposal back in have cross party support everybody be in favour of they all so it be disappointing that the bill do not include all of its proposal and recommendation that be sad because the government have miss an opportunity to make some positive change that would protect our leaseholder the government inaction and delay in tackle the extortionate cost associate with be leaseholder have have an impact not least on people finance as well as on their mental health and wellbeing many of my constituent regularly tell about the range of problem they face surge ground rent high service charge lack of transparency over charge poor customer service excessive administration charge charge for application to extend lease agreement or enfranchise and lack of knowledge and information about their right and obligation the leaseholder in battersea do not receive value for money on service charge which can be increase at the last minute they can go up drastically with little warning in one case someone have their service charge increase by without any breakdown of cost or transparency as to why that have happen at that time the management company be be not sure of the good way to describe this not forthcoming in addition it be abrasive belittling and rude in its response to we so it be important that the role of these management company and the way they be handle be address be pleased that the government be introduce long overdue measure to improve home ownership for many leaseholder the bill will make it cheap and easy to extend lease or buy the freehold and it will increase the standard lease extension term from year to year with the ground rent reduce to peppercorn obviously upon payment of premium that be good and welcome the fact that the secretary of state say today that the government will be consult on ground rent sadly he do not address my point about shared ownership and those who staircase to and then become leaseholder so hope the minister will clarify whether the consultation will seek to address that issue as well we need more transparency on thing such as service charge and it be right that the bill will provide that it will also provide for right to request information about those charge however as be mention by my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner and many other despite multiple assurance from ministers the government have turn on their commitment to end the leasehold system after all that they have be promise my constituent would have expect the government to go far and end this outdated system the bill do not even contain provision to ban the creation of new leasehold house as be promise in the king speech understand that that will be bring forward in committee but why on earth be it not in the bill today there be never go to be enough time to really go into detail about the challenge with the bill but it be important to note that housing be human right everybody should be able to live in safe decent warm and affordable home homeowner should be able to have security and have the power of their own home regardless of the type of tenure if you buy your home you expect it to be yours you do not expect there to be freeholder who own this aspect of it the government could take some lesson from labour as we will protect leaseholder through make commonhold the default tenure for all new property and by overhaul the system so that exist leaseholder can collectively purchase more easily and move to commonhold if that be their wish we be also commit to support house building in order to deal with the housing crisis that the tories have create and not address that be why we need this leadership on housing we do not need any more broken promise and fail policy from this government which have really leave this country in mess it be pleasure to follow the hon member for battersea marsha de cordova let start by pay tribute to the father of the house my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley who have be campaign on this issue for many year to great success eventually also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for redditch rachel maclean who be no long in her place for all the work she have do in the preparation of this bill welcome the principle of the bill some opposition members may say it be too timid but with page of detailed legislation and equation which remind of my time study physics and math at university it can hardly be say to be less than complex the key issue be have the government go far enough in what they intend to do our manifesto commitment be clear to promote fairness and transparency for leaseholder and ensure that consumer be protect from abuse and poor service clearly that be fundamental requirement the law commission review of leasehold law represent it and it be have take we six year to get to this point in deal with some of the abuse we have to remember that of people who have buy leasehold property regret buy they and of leaseholder be worried that they will not be able to sell their home because they be leasehold that be one fundamental thing we need to answer we also need this leasehold reform to reform and support the housing market because almost half of leaseholder be first time buyer and be under at time when few and few people be buy their first home at such an age it be vital that we not only encourage people to buy their first home but simplify the system so welcome the overarching aim of the bill to modernise this complex system but clearly there be still lot of work to do obviously make it cheap and easy for exist leaseholder in house and flat to extend their lease and buy their freehold be key point the so call marriage rate make it almost impossible for leaseholder to buy property with few than year leave on the lease and to extend that lease to year which be what we be now go to be look at have that as the standard position for house and flat have to be the right thing to do we should remember that the original position on extension be year for flat and year for house so we be introduce massive change and it be extremely welcome thank my constituency neighbour for give way if he be fortunate at the next election he may inherit some more leasehold flat as he will know in this country freeholder hold their freehold for period of year from the crown and that may run out before any new leasehold be able to conclude its year do he understand what the government propose to do in that situation longevity may run in my family but not to the extent of year the hon gentleman make good point and be sure the minister will seek to answer it in his sum up introduce new right for long leaseholder to buy out the ground rent without need to extend the term of the lease be another extremely welcome move as be remove the requirement for new leaseholder to have own their house for two year before they can benefit from the change the new right to require the freeholder to take leaseback of non participate unit when collective enfranchisement claim be make be also vital we do not want to get to position where people be deter from enfranchisement because they can not take on those who do not take on enfranchisement new cost regime for enfranchisement and right to manage claim so that each party bear their own cost be vital far too often the freeholder have seek to obtain their cost from the purchaser which be clearly unfair and unjust move jurisdiction for enfranchisement and right to manage dispute to the first tier tribunal and the leasehold valuation tribunal in wales make it much easy for party to identify how they can bring about dispute note the point the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts raise when he say that freeholder often make it as difficult as possible for enfranchisement to take place the issue of transparency of service charge be vital one of the benefit of serve on select committee for long time be be able to remember the report the committee be involve in and well remember an inquiry into this issue we want all service charge to be transparent and fix to the cost of provide that service as oppose to figure pluck out of the air and then pass on to the person supposedly receive the service it be welcome to see that the bill contain measure for minimum key financial and non financial information to be supply to those receive the service on regular basis include through standardised service charge and an annual report that mean leaseholder can scrutinise and well challenge cost if they be unreasonable equally replace building insurance commission for manage agent landlord and freeholder with transparent administration fee stop leaseholder from be charge exorbitant opaque commission on top of their premium an issue that have already be raise in the debate welcome scrap the presumption for leaseholder to pay their freeholder legal cost which in my opinion be outrageous as well as grant freehold owner on private and mixed tenure estate the same right of redress as leaseholder by extend their equivalent right to transparency over their estate charge and to challenge the charge they pay by take case to tribunal all these measure be welcome but there be many other area where we need to go far the promise to do away with leasehold or fleecehold completely be clear in the manifesto in my view that promise should be honour particularly on the sale of new build flat in london they be now the most common property type almost all flat be sell on leasehold basis compare to just of house on the individual building firm we have hear about persimmon but we should also remember bellway whose chief executive come in front of our select committee and tell we repeat what they say almost word for word that it be the company policy not to offer the freehold to leaseholder at the first opportunity instead six month after build the property and sell the leasehold it would transfer they to finance company which would go through the detail of all the charge it could make and then really leverage up those charge and the finance company would refuse to allow the leaseholder to even consider buy the freehold that be the policy of that company think permission admit that that be its policy too and other building company do exactly the same that be scandal and it should be stop and we should legislate for that clearly we all want to see the promotion of commonhold however as the chairman of the committee say we need more education for individual so they understand not only their right but the responsibility they would take on with commonhold one concern that have be raise with on several occasion be about what will happen once this welcome bill be on the statute book we look forward to the amendment that be make to exist leaseholder who buy their leasehold in good faith but be not be deal with properly or effectively we need to ensure that squeeze out the bad practice of freeholder and manage agent which be unfair to individual be part and parcel of the legislation there be also the issue of conveyance most people who buy their first property pay the minimum legal cost they can get away with as result they often be not give proper advice about the consequence of their decision we need to ensure that individual be give the opportunity to understand the responsibility they be take on and more importantly what will happen to they in the future if there be service charge involve local authority hold huge number of property under lease condition and if they want to sell the freehold to leaseholder they be often among the bad set of people to deal with across the country agree that leaseholder should have the right of first refusal if freehold be be offer will my hon friend the minister give commitment that after we have engage in consultation on service charge the result of those consultation will be reflect in committee so that we can strengthen the bill finally want to refer to particular building in constituency that neighbour mine it have floor and still have the old grenfell style cladding we all know the tragedy of grenfell but the owner of the building be refuse point blank to remove the cladding unless and until they be give planning permission to build on top of the building so that they can sell more property to pay for the cost of remediate the cladding the self same company ballymore although it have yet to submit planning application want to build block of flat the tall of which will be storey and the majority of which will be more than storey at density great than manhattan singapore or any other place in the world that be scandal when the secretary of state name certain building company he promise that if they refuse to carry out the work that they should do they would not be give planning permission to enable the development of more leasehold flat call on he to ensure that they be not give planning permission until such time as they be put right what they have put wrong pay tribute to all those who have fight for so long and so hard to achieve this limited reform will support the bill and look forward to we take forward further measure so that we can end the feudal system of leasehold once and for all have mention before that liberal have be campaign to end leasehold since the day of lloyd george so be pleased to see this piece of legislation finally be debate in the die day of this parliament hope that there be the time leave to pass it and see meaningful change for the many leaseholder leasehold comprise of the housing stock in england who be box in by exorbitant management charge and uncapped ground rent the content of the bill be welcome and the liberal democrats will not oppose it on second reading but like other member we have significant concern about the omission from it first the bill do not actually ban leasehold perhaps more importantly it do not ban the creation of new leasehold flat do not grasp the logic of argue that leasehold be outdated and unsuitable for the modern housing market while allow vast majority of leasehold arrangement to go ahead the liberal democrats support the comment make recently in the guardian by the shadow minister the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook that commonhold should be the new default tenure for all flat and that it should be easy for leaseholder to collectively purchase their freehold should they wish also agree with several other member that give leaseholder first refusal when the freehold be sell be good idea it seem to that without those more radical measure the bill be less leasehold reform and more leasehold tinker think that we all agree with the secretary of state that this be feudal system that need radical overhaul and be not sure why the bill do not go far to achieve that have be lobby and have some sympathy for the argument that there be need to ensure that there be clear line of responsibility and indeed liability for build maintenance and safety in large block of flat but most other country in fact all country other than australia have manage to achieve that without reliance on the leasehold model indeed our recent experience regard the safety of large block of flat with the cladding scandal suggest that in many instance the leasehold model have demonstrably fail to provide it we probably all agree on that point be also confused about why the bill omit to introduce professionalisation in the management of leasehold building the british property federation have say that the lack of any provision to introduce competency standard or regulation to our sector be miss opportunity give the experience of many leaseholder over the cladding scandal and the welcome professionalisation of the social housing sector hope that the government recognise the importance of ensure that management be professionalise and will seek to introduce such measure in committee wonder whether the minister would commit to that in his closing remark in my north shropshire constituency we do not have large number of flat but we have be plague to some extent by new housing development in which the housing be freehold but shared area service and essential infrastructure be manage by the original developer as we all know those be refer to as fleecehold and since be elect have tell number of horror story regard such arrangement both in this chamber and in westminster hall the provision in the bill that allow the right to challenge charge provide for great transparency of information and relate to the quality of work and an associated system of civil penalty be welcome step in the right direction but wonder whether could push the government to go far in that area the tenant of such development pay both their council tax and an estate management charge yet they often receive far bad service than those who live in adopt development and be subject only to council tax the hon member for dartford gareth johnson lay out some of the issue in his excellent speech so will not go into too much detail but urge the minister to consider end the practice of share ownership of public space for the vast majority of new development they have the commercial substance of leasehold and would like to see presumption that the share area around new development be almost always adopt by the local authority where the development be standard in nature where there be no good reason for that not to happen homeowner on those development should have their right clearly set out so that the matter can be settle quickly in court ask the minister to consider far the specific circumstance where asset such as sewage pumping equipment or ground source heat pump be share by everyone on the estate be grateful to he for listen to my concern prior to the debate freeholder use such equipment be dependent on its be instal and maintain to high standard but the experience of my constituent be that conveyance solicitor do not alert buyer to the risk involve in this type of structure and that the ownership structure can be opaque and almost impossible to challenge have one development in which the developer retain the ground source heat pump to be use by the rest of the house in separate company he charge the full cost of run that pump to the resident but keep the renewable heat incentive payment to himself make huge profit in the process the freeholder only route of redress be through the court because of the opaque management structure it be not clear that they will win and they do not really have the resource to commit to those legal proceeding it be not uncommon in rural place such as north shropshire for new development to use share septic tank rather than be connect to the main sewer if the tank have be instal to poor standard the cost of rectification be charge to the freeholder once they move in those be cost that they would not have anticipate when they buy the property would welcome great clarity over who be responsible for ensure that such shared asset be fit for purpose before the freehold house be sell for habitation currently such asset and service be outside the building control regime that mean that if someone get completion certificate on their house which might have be properly construct but their sewage system be not fit for purpose they will still have valid building control certificate and will be none the wiser when they buy the property ask the minister to consider whether further protection can be put in place such as ensure that inspection of those asset be include as part of the building control sign off ensure that reserve fund be be collect and appropriately ringfence through reasonable service charge throughout the life of such asset and allow freeholder to take joint ownership of the asset for nominal fee if they wish to do so right to manage would be so welcome for resident trap in such situation will the minister also expand on the issue of enforcement the additional right afford to leaseholder and those pay estate management charge will be effective only if there be an affordable way for leaseholder and fleeceholder to ensure that they can be enforce we all have experience of freeholder simply fail to respond to correspondence or require their tenant to take they to court in highly unaffordable process often charge the cost of that court process to leaseholder enforcement be therefore not really achievable at the moment but it be so important to ensure that those revenue stream be effectively squeeze for freeholder the bill be small step in the right direction but so much more could be do to end this outdated form of tenure it be when lloyd george describe leasehold as not business but blackmail it be high time that we grasp the nettle and end it there be much to welcome in the bill it be all too easy to believe that leasehold affect only london and the large city across the country but that be not so in the past to year in particular many more property have be build on leasehold basis many leaseholder be now face the dilemma of whether to extend it be estimate that there be million leasehold property equate to of the housing stock that include property in my constituency and have raise the matter in the house previously also have personal interest as leaseholder many year before come to this place have the unpleasant experience of extend our own lease the government make good progress with the leasehold reform ground rent act which limit ground rent to peppercorn on all new lease the bill that we be consider today do not include the same limitation to protect exist leaseholder from onerous and potentially very expensive ground rent without that up to million homeowner will be leave saddle with unfair ground rent my right hon friend the secretary of state who be no long in his place say that liberate leaseholder form vital part of the government long term plan for housing we can not have situation in which we be liberate future leaseholder while leave exist homeowner trap this be an urgent problem the government own consultation in identify it as trend leave leaseholder face significant and unsustainable increase in ground rent which often affect the saleability of their home so hope it will be address on new leasehold house welcome the government commitment to end the creation of new leasehold house it be time we move on from what other hon member have also describe as an archaic system that hold homeowner back however be concerned that measure to do that have not appear in the bill as draft my understanding be that the government intend to bring forward amendment for that purpose but would also like an assurance from my hon friend the minister at the dispatch box that that will be the case be also concerned that new leasehold house may still be permit under exceptional circumstance ask my hon friend the minister to tell exactly what those circumstance cover and to assure that safeguard will also be put in place we need to ensure that that exception be use sparingly if at all and do not become loophole for developer who simply wish to push more leasehold in through the back door turn to the extension of exist lease or the acquisition of freehold an important and necessary part of the propose change will be the extension of the lease with new standard year lease with zero ground rent the removal of the marriage value from the premium calculation be also welcome and much need and potentially represent fair and equitable change for leaseholder as you may recall deputy speaker raise my concern in the debate on the king speech that those reform be long overdue be disappointed that they have come forward so late in this parliament especially when we promise reform as far back as february for one would not want to see current leaseholder who have no choice but to renegotiate their current lease now unfairly leave out in the cold by our legislating so late in this parliament therefore ask the minister to consider sunset clause in the bill to allow anyone who have have to negotiate since the start of the current parliament to be afford right of passage under the reform to extend their lease to the new standard like my hon friend the member for redditch rachel maclean who be no long in her place would welcome the introduction of an online calculator for calculate the cost of an extension believe that would make the process simple and more streamlined for those who be seek to extend their lease or acquire the freehold however it must also be quick and inexpensive for leaseholder to calculate and find out the cost of an extension because currently that be not the case put simply the current system of use archaic graph be another way to set the system against the leaseholder and sadly too much of the current system be weight in favour of the freeholder that be why this legislation be so badly need the change to ensure that legal cost be share as oppose to the current system whereby the leaseholder bear all the cost be also welcome we also need to end the weighting of independent arbitration through the tribunals service in favour of the freeholder in consider this bill we have the opportunity to shape legislation and create level playing field for both party on commonhold we also need to do more reform would give the leaseholder of flat the right to acquire and manage the common part of the building that be potentially welcome change provide that protection against the abuse of service charge be in place however when it come to dispute there be clear need to revamp the tribunal system it do not fulfil what it be set out to achieve the tribunal system be create to strengthen the right of long leaseholder and to provide cheap and quick way to resolve dispute yet in reality it be the antithesis of that leaseholder often avoid the tribunal system altogether due to fear of become liable for the freeholder tribunal cost and regrettably there be many case where freeholder landlord recruit high powered barrister and simply pass their fee on to the leaseholder regardless of whether they win or lose it be also fair to say that that lead to leaseholder worry that they will be unable adequately to defend their position on for example raise dispute over unreasonable administration charge that need to change we need renewed and refresh tribunal system that empower and protect leaseholder there be additional thing that we can also do to see improvement now for those with leasehold the right to manage be an important part of our toolkit and welcome measure in the bill to improve that process the current claim process be complex and leaseholder can find their attempt frustrate by rogue freeholder who block they from exercise their right would like to see more of the law commission recommendation implement particularly where we can make the process cheap and less complicated to implement let we be bold and include more measure to help our homeowner to take back control there be also strong need for new regulatory model for manage agent under the current system anyone can become manage agent regardless of experience unfortunately many leaseholder report countless problem with their agent from high service charge to lack of transparency or exclusion from decision making of course there be some manage agent who perform well and choose to sign up to standard of practice but there be many who do not this for be clear case of moral hazard it must be address and we have the opportunity to do so through this bill be pleased that the government have commit to regulate manage agent through single mandatory and legally enforceable code of practice manage agent will be require to have nationally recognise qualification to practice which will be oversee by an independent regulator by require they to adhere to minimum standard through professional body we can expect to see high level of professional conduct among all manage agent finally want to mention housing association would hope to see under this new legislation requirement for great transparency on service charge and the replacement of build insurance commission for manage agent or landlord with transparent administration fee to benefit leaseholder who have exercise their right to buy within the social housing sector and those within the leasehold retirement bracket recently have come across numerous example in my own constituency where leaseholder in those sector have be leave with unexplainable and unjustifiable bill something that this legislation must stamp out to conclude we have an opportunity with this bill to get rid of archaic process and system to renew and refresh the legislation on leasehold and to create level playing field there be much to welcome but still believe there be more that we can do through this legislation it be pleasure to speak on the second reading of the leasehold and freehold reform bill and to follow so many excellent contribution from member across the house they have all provide example most of which have experience in my eight and half year in this place for year and year leaseholder campaigner and group such as the leasehold knowledge partnership have be warn the government about the huge harm be do by our outdated feudal and antique leasehold system many of we have raise it in this house problem with leasehold be one of the big issue bring to by constituent and be sure if the minister join in meet resident of just one or two block in my constituency whether it be great west quarter in brentford grove house in isleworth or wheatstone house in chiswick he would see the wide array of problem cause by the leasehold system we have have nearly four year of promise from successive conservative housing ministers and secretaries of state to commit definitely to leasehold reform the government have talk good game but fail to deliver the big comprehensive package of reform need this piece of legislation be yet another example of that failure this be suppose to be the grand reform bill from the grand reform secretary of state who be not currently in his place he have become the conservatives mr fix it he be send in to fix the justice system and then the cabinet office and even to deliver the parting blow to the former prime minister when he be present with the leasehold system there be glimmer of hope that the government would slay the vested interest and finally fix this antique system but no the right hon member have flinch he have fail because before we today we see timid and narrow bill that do not go anywhere near far enough to fix the problem face by leaseholder most new home in my constituency be flat not house so although end the sale of leasehold house be welcome overall it will not help my constituent and the million across the country who be still live in or face the prospect of live in leasehold flat if the house will indulge will give typical example of why the leasehold system be outdate and just what the legislation should be address imagine someone in their early on the career ladder in reasonably well pay job they have save up for year often while stick in private rental they finally have enough for mortgage and they can just about afford the monthly repayment rate they look across west london and can not afford to buy house but they then see glossy advert for flat at first glance it look perfect they have work out that they can get mortgage and use their deposit to get foot on the ladder it look as if their salary can pay the mortgage and the service charge so they buy and assume that they have stake in the home that they now own too often they be keep in the dark by solicitor who be often recommend by developer they move in and the problem start they notice few problem the promise concierge might not be there the gym on the brochure never open rubbish be leave in the hallway the car park barrier and the door from the car park into the flat be often break create security hazard and heating and hot water stop work for week on end they report those issue but nothing happen then they get their service charge bill in the post it have increase to more than year over more than what they be tell they would be spend one constituent have see trebling of their service charge since they buy their flat in but while the service charge go up the service get bad leaseholder feel that they be treat like cash cow then they be hit with an increase in their building insurance what be year be now or more they ask why those cost have go up but they do not receive specific or clear answer many be face with have to sell sometimes at loss if they be lure into share ownership manage by housing association they face additional problem the part buy part rent set up be suppose to be target at keyworker in the public sector many of whom be on fix pay on top of the mortgage and service charge those so call owner they be not really owner be out that their rent be go up in many case my constituent in share ownership have see rent increase of or they only own or and if they need to sell they have to sell through their housing association unless they be in the fortunate position of be able to step up and own the lease outright report that read say that many housing association drag their foot on resale as there be not much money to make from they they focus their energy on get the new block sell have hear from many constituent who be share owner they wait month and month to sell and have to pay for costly valuation while they be trap in limbo try to get on with their life many of my constituent who be leaseholder be also unable to sell because they be wait for remediation work to begin on block deem to be unsafe much of that emerge follow the tragedy at grenfell bank will still not approve mortgage for those block until the work be carry out which mean that again those leaseholder be trap in limbo in one case in my constituency galliard homes have delay and delay take any action despite promise that it would start month ago leaseholder in block below metre be still responsible for funding building safety fix they be carve out and leave to deal with the crisis themselves for one of my constituent that mean bill hang over their head the building safety crisis be wide symptom of the building culture that the leasehold system encourage system in which small number of people and company be able to make huge profit with absolutely zero oversight of the build quality let move on to repair the resident of wheatstone house in chiswick which be manage by face an example of poor repair service leaseholder and tenant in that block have know their hot water and heating not to work for day on end that start last winter and be back again this winter each time resident get lacklustre and slow response from we see repeat of such poor service when peabody catalyst drag its foot for month in fix the lift at aplin way in isleworth trap some resident upstairs the developer then try to leave leaseholder with huge bill other have district heating system that run at efficiency but cost lot of money what do the legislation do to address those issue on service charge management company have their cake and eat it the hon member for dartford gareth johnson who be no long in his place mention the excess charge increase well above inflation deteriorate service and opaque bill management company be often too closely align by ownership with the freeholder the same name keep come up rendall rittner and firstport appear to be hoover up the management contract for range of block include housing association share ownership and resident management company all the while provide an appalling service to the leaseholder on decline value and the need to extend lease constituent have tell about how they worry about their future if they have less than year leave on their lease do not think that the bill do enough to address that challenge be pleased that my hon friend the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook have say that labour government would go far and ensure that everyone who want to move from leasehold to commonhold would be able to do so labour government will make commonhold the default tenure for all new property and will carry out the law commission recommendation welcome that labour will also address the omission on deferment rate we will do what the conservatives have fail to do have touch on only some of the many and varied issue that my leaseholder constituent have face the legislation do not go far enough for they and will not fix the problem that they face it will not help those who be stick in limbo and unable to sell it will not help those who be trick into share ownership with false promise and it will not prevent yet more leaseholder from have their life turn upside down when someone be hand their first set of key it should be day of dream but for so many of my constituent and million of people across the country that dream have turn into nightmare the government have chance to end that nightmare through this piece of legislation but they have fail to do so leaseholder at artillery row pay on average in service charge each month the manage agent avon ground rents ltd refuse to disclose what be include in those charge and to provide invoice one of the charge be for legal and professional fee request without explanation or detail even though leaseholder ask reasonably for information for over two year leaseholder in neville house in westminster be live in cladding nightmare although westminster city council issue hazard awareness notice on the building no remedial work have be undertake because the manage agent estates management ltd have fail to agree with the developer berkeley homes on the term of survey licence as result the home be unsellable the leaseholder of blake tower on the barbican estate be live in building with ongoing fire safety issue the developer redrow commit to deal with those issue but have yet to undertake the necessary inspection the tower also have build defect so serious that they have result in several flat be unliveable the local authority the city of london corporation share my concern and those of my constituent and understand that it be about to take action those be just few example of the appalling behaviour of freeholder in my constituency have be contact by countless leaseholder who routinely report appal practice relate to service charge the cost of major work and the extortionate charge they face when renew their lease when they request information or explanation they often face wall of silence from freeholder and their agent extortionate be probably the correct word as what some freeholder and their accomplice include manage agent lawyer and accountant be involve in be often little well than extortion those freeholder should instead be describe as freeloader the bill respond to the concern raise by so many of my constituent for example clause aim to make service charge more transparent end the practice of demand unexplained service charge that too many freeholder engage in often just to profit off leaseholder the introduction of standardised form for freeholder request service charge from their leaseholder be certainly welcome but would like more detail about what information will need to be disclose and how much warning freeholder will have to give leaseholder regard cost too many of my leaseholder constituent have tell that they choose not to take their landlord to tribunal as they could be liable for their huge legal fee even if they win therefore welcome clause which respond to that concern by ensure that leaseholder will no long be liable for those cost also welcome the fact that the bill overhaul previous legislation by increase the standard lease extension term for house and flat to year as well as reduce ground rent to peppercorn upon payment of premium that will ensure that leaseholder can enjoy secure ground rent free ownership of their own property without the hassle and expense of repeat lease extension another game changer in the bill be the commitment to remove marriage value for far too long when leaseholder want to extend their lease they have be at the mercy of their freeholder and that freeholder agent and have face some questionable practice the bill make it cheap and easy for leaseholder to extend their lease or buy their freehold it remove the requirement to pay marriage value cap the treatment of ground rent at of the freehold value in the calculation and prescribing rate for that calculation clause will increase the non residential limit of block from to when it come to secure the right to manage and enfranchisement mean that more block that be mix of residential and commercial property will have the right to manage and buy their freehold however that still require of the leaseholder in block to agree to go ahead with the right to manage which could prove near impossible for many of my constituent due to the unique nature of the cities of london and westminster over property in the city of london and staggering in westminster have owner who live abroad or be own by company use central london golden postcode as place to park their cash as such while my constituent and warmly welcome the government intention to support leaseholder who want to manage their block it will prove difficult in my constituency to achieve the of signatory require if the propose legislation be to achieve what the government hope for constituency such as mine ask they to consider make the threshold more flexible perhaps by state that of signatory should be leaseholder of apartment that be their main home rather than an investment or reduce the threshold for the right to manage to of leaseholder would welcome further discussion with the minister my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire lee rowley on that point thank he for meet and my leasehold reform working group make up of constituent who be deal with some of the most egregious freeholder in my constituency the threshold be discuss in some detail with the minister at that meeting another area of huge concern for leaseholder be the cost of major work and estate management charge have lose count of the number of constituent who have contact for help regard those issue for example leaseholder live on the golden lane estate in the city be be ask to pay ten of thousand of pound extra because the freeholder the city of london corporation be year behind schedule in russell house and churchill gardens which be both in pimlico resident be fail to secure detail on timing and cost from westminster city council time and again receive complaint from constituent live in private and social block that while they appreciate that they have to pay for major work and repair they want the freeholder whether it be private company or local authority to be open and transparent about cost therefore welcome clause of the bill which will provide more transparency about major work cost similar to service charge expense landlord will have to fill out standardised form to demonstrate exactly how the leaseholder money will be spend and ensure that the work be carry out to certain standard take this opportunity to thank harry scoffin the founder of free leaseholders for his incredible work his support and technical knowledge have be invaluable to and my constituent when consider the bill welcome the bill and look forward to work with the minister and my constituent to ensure that we end the many questionable practice of some freeholder and ensure that the leasehold and freehold system in this country be open transparent and fair it be pleasure to take part in this debate it have be fascinating to hear from member from around the chamber pay tribute to the dedicated campaigner include the leasehold knowledge partnership and the national leasehold campaign for their hard work up to this point they have campaign tirelessly for justice in the broken leasehold system and for the government to live up to their own manifesto promise and bring this bill before the house be sure they will continue to campaign it be estimate that there be million leasehold home in england that be million household stick in system that deny people power control or even say over the security safety and future of their own home as we have see this be cross party issue member from across the house have be express the concern of their constituent for many year long before arrive in this place year ago this bill be an opportunity to rebalance the scale in favour of leaseholder but the question remain will it actually do so unfortunately and many other feel disappointed by the limited state of the bill before we it be often say that an empty vessel make the loud noise we have hear lot of noise which may reveal the reality that this bill be somewhat hollow not only do it not ensure that new flat will be sell as freehold contrary to what minister have claim it do not even do what it say on the tin and ban the sale of new leasehold house as the government originally promise because it contain no provision to end leasehold on newly build house in england and wales understand that that ban be go to be bring in in committee but it be first promise in december by the right hon member for bromsgrove sajid javid originally the government claim to have run out of time to put it into the bill but they have be plan it for six year they repeatedly comment on how complicated leasehold law be yet they can not include that one simple provision in the bill in reality it be leaseholder who be exasperate indeed it appear that the government have drop quite lot of the law commission recommendation they claim that the bill will make it easy cheap and quick to buy the freehold or extend the lease on property but how do we know that without know what the prescribed rate will be thousand of leaseholder have be wait for this bill to arrive and in the meantime they remain in state of leasehold limbo trap by this iniquitous system many be unable to sell and move on with their life they be be force into game of poker in which the stake could not be high do leaseholder stick and wait to buy their freehold or extend their lease in itself an appreciate asset in the hope that government promise to make it cheap actually materialise or do they twist and pay these faceless offshore investment company thousand of pound do not know the answer and be not too sure the government do either professional valuer and leasehold solicitor be struggle to advise their client too without know what the prescribed rate be go to be when calculate these figure the claim that this legislation will make it cheap to buy be unsubstantiated also miss from the bill be the regulation of property agent the single big rip off in the leasehold system be service charge and without robust regulation of this it will continue and leaseholder will remain at the mercy of bad manage agent on the opposition benches we be commit to implement the recommendation of lord best working group which be publish by the government four long year ago and on which they have sit the government have yet another consultation which leaseholder be busy complete as we speak on reduce current ground rent for exist leaseholder as the hon member for harrow east bob blackman have point out it be not quite clear what the relationship be between this bill and that consultation but perhaps the minister will expand on that after so many year of unfulfilled promise the government appear to have yet again fail to deliver for our constituent as my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner have say labour government will make commonhold the default tenure for all new property as part of our commitment to reform the leasehold system fundamentally and comprehensively by enact in full the law commission recommendation on enfranchisement commonhold and the right to manage be glad to see this bill in front of we but from listen to this debate it be still clear that there remain great deal of work ahead before these fine ambition become reality in fact it be become increasingly clear that we need labour government to truly deliver for the so many people stick in this feudal system it be pleasure to be speak on the second reading of this bill which see long term change to improve home ownership for leaseholder and freeholder alike as many people have say the bill be much need and be glad it be finally here it be also pleasure to be speak on behalf of constituent of mine who do not wish to be name but who through the numerous conversation have have with she over the year have enlighten about the significant difficulty and obstacle that many leaseholder face these difficulty include but be not limit to high service and administration fee disproportionate cost when want to extend lease manage agent display poor practice and in particular imbalance in the dispute mechanism most of these my constituent have have to deal with personally and they have impact on she in numerous way and lead to long hard battle that she be still fight can only imagine the stress and concern that this bring to many family and many of these point have be raise already this evening it be through these conversation that know how many leaseholder feel insecure and uneasy about own home with the sector as it currently stand leaseholder be residential sector that make up million property of the housing stock in england as such it be important that we strike balance between the right of the tenant and those of the landlord while ensure that there be more power and protection for those own home the government have commit to not only increase housing supply but ensure that more people feel protect and secure when look to rent or own their own home that be problem do not need to mention in this house yet again give the pressure of live in an idyllic coastal area such as north norfolk which have some of the high number of second home and holiday accommodation in the uk similarly welcome the renters reform bill for tenant and landlord and it be encouraging to see that extend to leasehold and freehold as well however as other in the chamber have say the bill do not go far enough in the eye of many it can be incredibly tiring financially tax and stressful for leaseholder especially when try to extend their lease or challenge poor practice the bill be try to make it cheap and easy for leaseholder in house and flat to extend their lease and buy the freehold improve transparency and rebalance the legal cost regime as well as remove barrier for leaseholder to challenge their landlord unreasonable charge at tribunal commend the hon gentleman for what he be say know the leasehold and freehold reform bill be for england and wales but it seem that there be many good thing in it that even if the bill do not go far enough be to be welcome may through the hon gentleman ask the minister on the finalisation of the bill to share information about it with the northern ireland assembly and the northern ireland department for communities in particular to ensure that we can take advantage of the good thing in the bill back home thank the hon gentleman for that intervention and think he be right there be many good thing in the bill but it do need to go far will come on to some of the issue in moment but the particular item on which we need to go far be those raise directly by my constituent who have write to about this for the last couple of year it be welcome that the bill be here but already understand that it will be amend which will be important as it go forward as have say be aware that the government be plan amendment to take the bill far say to my hon friend the minister that we should give ample time to consult on those amendment particularly for and my constituent those in respect of the first tier tribunal system to ensure that all barrier be remove for leaseholder challenge their landlord we also need to take time to discuss the benefit of bolster commonhold to ensure that leaseholder who own flat have the same protection and freedom as those who live in house there need to be well regulation of manage agent that have be mention already and as basic requirement the first tier tribunal system need the jurisdiction to enforce its own order without strengthen the bill on that in particular there will not be significant impact on my constituent we have say all along that the bill have cross party support which be really positive in this place as have say before it be positive to see the government be take lead step to help ensure that leaseholder be well protect it be open up further opportunity for people to own their own home but hope it do go far so that can support my constituent and we can really deliver the radical change we need may begin by echo the comment of those on both front benches in support all those who for many year have be work on leasehold reform as we have see from this debate this cut across the benches because it be classic example of the reality that we see in our constituency surgery day in and day out also pay tribute to the all party parliamentary group on leasehold and commonhold reform for all the work it have do know that have benefit from read much of its material while try often in vain frankly to help constituent with freehold manager company as we head into the festive period know that this would be the good possible christmas present we could give to so many people who be struggle with the impact of what call day to day admin or work they have to do to manage the fact that they have leasehold property in my constituency like that of so many other hon member thousand of people be in that position it be not just about the cost of renew lease it be the day to day problem that come from be in leasehold block give that it be the festive period and we all want to give people good news at this time of the year have to tell the minister that it do feel bit as though my constituent have see santa sleigh fly past with all the lovely present but all they be get be lump of coal because so many of they be in flat that will not be affect by this legislation may urge he to think about what more we could do to protect those people in flat because there have be an explosion of this particularly in city and in area such as mine sadly be tell this evening that condé nast have describe part of my constituency as one of the new hot place always dread it when see that because it mean lot more building lot more pressure on house price and very little support for my local resident so many of the people who move into those property will be move into leasehold property and face these problem they will face that basic nightmare of think they own their home when they really do not it be theirs but only under certain condition it be not their castle to do what they want with those condition can be about whether they can have pet or loft extension during the pandemic many resident could not access the energy save proposal because that have to be do at leaseholder level and their leasehold manager be not do anything about it there have be good freehold company as well as bad one there be variation but the fundamental challenge at the heart of this legislation and why ask the secretary of state about it early be that commonhold be the only way we can genuinely give voice to people it be voice that deal with the leasemin problem much more so than have the most efficient freehold management company possible so want to stress to the minister that there be still time to put commonhold as the default tenure into this legislation and give people the christmas present they really deserve the most proper protection against be exploit that we could offer let give the minister some context for why feel so strongly about this the number of flat in my community have rise in the last eight year while the number of other type of property have remain broadly static frankly every time kirstie and phil turn up in walthamstow we see another tower block go up and those tower block be leasehold more than half the property transaction last year be for leasehold property this be massive issue now for most local resident fundamentally change the nature of my community both in term of the people who can afford to live in those property and the impact this be have on the cost of living it be no surprise to that have the ninth high level of child poverty when look at people who have buy what they think be great starter home but then find themselves saddle with charge and cost that they can not afford in order to try to stay in the area the question for be whether this legislation will address the challenge that they be face and do not see that happen however do want to acknowledge there be many thing in the legislation that we all welcome such as the shift to peppercorn rent and end escalate ground rent which for some of my constituent have be massive challenge and the idea of long default lease many people in my constituency be part of group of leaseholder because they live in property that be build en masse that be not recent phenomenon indeed want to talk about the warner estate in walthamstow they be beautiful property and declare that use to live in one myself they be build from the to house the worker for our local industrial estate in the lea valley they be purpose build flat build in two storey terrace row with double front door and split back garden on practical basis that mean that both resident in the property have to want to buy the freehold which create barrier for people and challenge for so many of my constituent more fundamentally the frustration see be that although thousand of resident live in these property every single one of they have different interaction with the freehold manager that be partly because in situation happen which this legislation would not deal with the warner estate be sell and split up between circle final brief and various other commercial freeholder the minister might say that the resident would have have the right of first refusal but because the leasehold company be sell within parent company and child company of each other resident do not get look in therefore local resident who organise themselves into warner estate resident group have have to deal with different company even though they live side by side complicate their ability to exercise what few right they have under exist legislation that mean that there be different price for renewal of the same length of lease and different price for quote for have an extension and the paperwork need for that the most egregious difference be in the insurance they be all charge in fact many year ago they be ask to take on terrorism insurance for live in these property when query that with the freehold company be send back the detail of somebody who have be accuse of terrorism and live in walthamstow therefore those who want to continue to live in the warner property as leaseholder need to pay that additional premium that be all perfectly legal and at the moment in this legislation there be no way to challenge that when freeholder take the be try to find polite parliamentary term guess my leaseholder on the warner estate be at least grateful that they do not have lease for bridge court which be under be sure the minister will know the name of this management company management indicate assent as the minister be nod he will know the amount of casework that small set of property only flat have generate for over the year to give some example of the charge resident have face one be give an extra bill and another be due to be evict for be spuriously charge by that company it be not legally possible for those resident to withhold those payment and not lose their property so they have to try to find the money to pay even though it be patently obvious that that egregious company be levy the charge as punishment for their have dare to exercise their right the only option open to they be to go to court again this legislation offer nothing to help support people in such situation it offer nothing to help support people when their freehold manager shift the leasehold around to avoid they have the right to manage or even the right to buy their own freehold out this company decide the private communal garden could be turn into public car park open up the entire estate and let in huge problem with antisocial behaviour all because it think it could make fast buck in the london area with car park then transfer the ownership of the building to triplerose management company own by israel moskovitz who be part of management just the other week resident come to to point out that they have an onerous ground rent clause which mean that their ground rent have to be review every five year against the retail price rate that be not in the original lease but be add in the owner of that property try to sell the flat and they ask whether they could vary that condition because it be stop they be able to sell it triplerose respond demand an immediate non refundable payment to provide quote just quote for what it would cost to vary that condition it then come back with quote of for an admin fee for legal fee and for the premium have some casework that sound similar to that which the hon lady be describe it be at pebble beach in seaton constituent write to say that she want to change the name on the deed and introduce her partner name and firstport want to charge her just to get its approval do the hon lady agree that some of the leasehold company we be talk about be charge fortnum mason price for service we might associate with trotters independent traders think even del boy have limit compare with some of the people we be talk about the minister would probably say that in those circumstance the change be make to ground rent should resolve the situation and he would be right but my broad point be that those resident have no redress at the moment the bill do not come with form of redress and without redress it do not matter what right people have because they can not action they those resident actually do go to first tier tribunal they club together take on the risk and win and understandably so because if someone turn the private garden into car park allow people into the block that do rather undermine the concept of service charge they have be wait three year for the compensation they be entitle to as result of that ruling again nothing in the bill would change that but that they go to tribunal with company with such track record for do these thing over and over again and that it mean nothing for future legislation and have no preventive effect be perhaps the big and most important message ministers should take from this debate the fact that people can not set precedent by win leasehold tribunal mean that resident who live in block that be very similar go through the same fight again and again and the same company know they can get away with it again and again in any other legal situation there would be court precedent and opportunity for redress for our constituent surely one of the thing that we can do through the bill be to change that and learn from other court because that leasemin be so time consume and stressful to so many of these people and that be why they end up at our doorstep nobody want to take on the risk of legal action if they can avoid it especially if they have no guarantee that even though the situation be patently unfair and somebody else have win very similar case that will make difference we see it every single day we see the people with repair think of hainault court in my constituency which have freeholder of various name include freshwater highdorn and daejan it use different one all the time where resident have spend hour of their life try to get the basic repair that they pay their service charge for they be charge to replace collapse boundary wall they get their own estimate and it should have cost only or in community where everybody be short of cash at the end of the month and every single penny count know that they have no alternative be very poor place to be wish could say that situation be just in the private sector but my own council be take to court successfully by leaseholder over the charge be propose for repair and renovation in some of our local estate again hope that the minister think about the right to manage which be difficult to do in block with mix of social housing and leasehold property in london there be an awful lot of those property thank to right to buy also think of those people stick with nothing to put any impetus on their property manager to do the right thing even though they recognise that they need to do the right thing think of hoffmans road in my constituency which be in that patch that condé nast be tell everybody to visit right now the resident have no security on their building because the door do not work the property company fexco tell that it be problem for the developer taylor wimpey taylor wimpey however think it be for the property manager to use the money from the service charge to fix it nothing in this legislation will give those resident my constituent the ability to just get it sort in the way that commonhold would we all have hundred of example one thing that have learn in this place over year be that when we get these precious opportunity when there be cross party agreement that reform need to happen we should aim for the big reform because we might not get the opportunity ever again nobody in this chamber can defend freehold nobody can defend leasehold we can all see the value in have system that allow our constituent to have direct voice goodness know be sure for many of we it would cut the amount of casework we have if nothing else it would be lot clear what redress our resident have before they have to go to court in the first place if we can not have court make precedent set ruling can we at least look at how we can give our resident strong voice for so many of they it be the difference between life well live and life live in stress wish that they have never even buy the thing that they dream of fight for and save for long of all have cladding developer that say that it have put itself out of business so that it do not have to do the cladding it be too small to be liable for it those resident be still wait for redress all those issue tell we that this be not about big political issue it be about the day to day practical implementation if we get this legislation right we can solve so many headache for so many people hope the minister will not be scrooge hope he will not be the grinch hope he will think about what he can do for all those people sit in those flat tonight look at the lump of coal that this legislation represent for they will he extend the christmas cheer not just to those who might have be threaten by leasehold for house but to all those in leasehold flat right now know it would give everybody very good if he do it have be privilege to sit here for five hour and listen to all the passionate contribution from all part of the house with pretty unanimous view first thank cath williams katie kendrick and barry kushner for their help in my constituency with the many leaseholder issue that have have for million of people the housing sector be break everywhere within it we see huge imbalance of power and that have have devastating impact on the health and wellbeing of thousand of my constituent in liverpool west derby and so many people across the country as we have hear today that injustice be encapsulate by the frankly medieval ownership framework which create clear imbalance of power between leaseholder and freeholder the scandal of leasehold must be bring to an end for the million who have buy their home but do not feel like they own it while welcome the promise of some of the reform in this long overdue bill many of which come from the select committee on which serve be extremely disappointed that it do not directly tackle ground rent suspect that the government know exactly what exist leaseholder urgently require from they on ground rent so be dismay that rather than address that matter directly they have decide to consult on it the vested interest have definitely win again practically every constituent have hear from on this matter and there have be many tell that they want ground rent abolish so that they can be guarantee secure ground rent free ownership of their property for year to come without the stress and expense of repeat lease extension note that the hon member for harrow east bob blackman agree he speak eloquently about it today and he say last week that ground rent on leasehold property need to be peppercorn or zero it as simple as that my constituent also want to see bill that contain all the law commission proposal rather than the water down version before we today be glad that our front bench team confirm that that be what we will do if we get into government be also dismay that the government have not go so far as to abolish new leasehold on flat that be huge mistake can the minister give reason why flat which make up of leasehold property will continue to be sell as leasehold when he be elect on specific manifesto promise to end that practice the government have the opportunity in this bill to put stop to what the secretary of state himself recently call the outdated feudal system of leasehold instead they appear content for new flat to continue to be buy and sell as leasehold that be incredibly disappointing for so many people across the country if minister be serious about do away with leasehold they need to ban leasehold on all new flat as well as new house let we be clear the only argument for retain leasehold on flat be to allow management agency and freeholder to continue to exploit leaseholder for the purpose of profit over principle with the status quo prevail that have not be the mood music from those on the government front bench but talk be cheap in this place as have find out until leasehold be ban homeowner will continue to be hold hostage in their own home give the current economic situation the delay and lack of clarity on timetable for overdue reform be increasingly frustrating for my constituent it be unacceptable that they continue to be subject to extortionate unjustified charge and escalate ground rent what be more be convinced that the leasehold system be not only unfair but genuine health and safety risk as have be outline today when we consider the continue delay to the vital fire safety recommendation make by the inquiry into the grenfell tower fire the national leasehold campaign have welcome this long overdue legislation but consider several key item to be miss from the bill and completely agree those measure include but be not limit to prescribe capitalisation and deferment rate for valuer to value lease extension or freehold purchase abolish forfeiture which be use against leaseholder and serve as massive windfall for freeholder an online calculator for lease extension and freehold purchase step to progress the adoption of commonhold the regulation of manage agent as we have hear about today and make it easy for leaseholder to have the right to manage if the government be truly serious about end the nightmare for leaseholder they need to urgently revisit this legislation suggest that they meet the national leasehold campaign and the law commission to ensure that the key recommendation by both body be include in the bill as it move forward start by declare an interest my wife be the joint chief executive of the law commission whose work intend to cite in my remark it be pleasure to close this second reading debate for the opposition and thank all right hon and hon member who have participate in it echo what so many other have say and add my own tribute to all the individual and organisation who have campaign for so long for reform in this area as number of contributor to the debate have point out we have wait long time for this bill it be just under six year ago that the then secretary of state the right hon member for bromsgrove sajid javid announce that the government intend to introduce series of measure to end unfair and abusive practice within the leasehold system include quote here from government press release in december legislate to prevent the sale of new build leasehold house that announcement be develop three year later during the tenure of the right hon member for newark robert jenrick as secretary of state in write ministerial statement date january he announce seminal two part legislation to implement leasehold and commonhold reform in this parliament the first part of that two part legislative agenda duly follow in the form of the leasehold reform ground rent act although we and in particular the shadow minister for homelessness and building safety my hon friend the member for weaver vale mike amesbury press minister to use that act to implement further reform we nonetheless support the government in pass it in the month since the act come into force successive ministers have make all manner of extravagant promise about what the second part of the seminal two part legislation would entail indeed the current secretary of state in an interview with the sunday times in january this year even go so far as to declare without qualification that he intend to abolish the leasehold system in its entirety leaseholder across the country whose daily life be often make miserable by the unjust and discriminatory practice that our archaic leasehold system facilitate take tory ministers at their word they expect the second part of the promise two part legislative agenda to live up to the weighty promise make by the government they have be badly let down have wait so long and have their expectation raise so high they be understandably disappointed at the limited bill that we be consider today and it be limited bill and no amount of bravado from the secretary of state can alter that fact they be also perplexed as we be that legislation that the government claim would end leasehold on newly build house in england and wales do not actually contain any provision to end such leasehold when the minister respond to the debate he will no doubt attempt to brush that criticism aside as he do in oral question last week on the ground that it be entirely normal for key provision of bill to be add in committee sadly as my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner mention in open the debate it be common practice for this government and this secretary of state in particular to significantly expand the size and scope of bills by incorporate swathe of government amendment in committee and on report in way that limit the ability of hon member to ensure that full scrutiny take place however the minister be fool no one in attempt to suggest that the omission from the legislation of key provision be always the government intent remind the house as my hon friend the member for city of chester samantha dixon do that the right hon member for bromsgrove commit the government to legislate to prevent the sale of new build leasehold house nearly six year ago the government have no excuse whatsoever for fail to include in the bill the provision necessary to enact that commitment in order for the house to consider they properly today that they fail to do so no doubt owe more to hurried drafting and to the wrangling between the department and no that have take place over recent month in respect of this bill than to any consider design however for all the confusion that surround it the legislation before we have answer one important question how ambitious do the government wish to be when it come to leasehold reform because this unambitious piece of legislation make it clear that proponent of caution and restraint have win out over those who want to lay claim to legacy of bold reform in this area that criticism can not simply be brush aside as carp on the part of the opposition the government poverty of ambition have real implication for leaseholder be routinely gouge by freeholder under the present system take flat which be the overwhelming majority of new leasehold property be create and the source of most of the leasehold relate complaint that receive from constituent the government state solution for they as make clear by baroness penn in the other place just last week be reinvigorate commonhold yet the minister of state make it clear on monday that the government do not intend to incorporate into this bill any provision whatsoever relate to commonhold despite the clear commitment they make in instead it remain part of their long term approach in other word the government offer to swathe of leaseholder across the country be jam tomorrow the hon member for redditch rachel maclean know affectionately as no on these benches give the game away she say that all the work have already be do on commonhold so it be not matter of complexity it be political choice on the government part not to introduce commonhold provision in this legislation what be so gall about the position that minister have adopt be that there be clearly widespread support across the house for the more ambitious leasehold reform that could have be incorporate into the bill and this debate have demonstrate it however in the die day of this government we be where we be while we deeply regret the bill lack of ambition we have no intention of vote against second reading this evening we support the intent of the provision in the legislation before we and the principle of the bill as whole the measure it contain will give homeowner in england and wales some great right power and protection over their home that be not to say that we do not have concern about the efficacy of some of they we do and we will seek to strengthen the bill in number of way in committee for example we believe that clause and which be intend to protect leaseholder from cover the legal and valuation cost associate with lease extension require tighten if we be to prevent in practice freeholder recover litigation and non litigation cost to take another example we believe that clause which seek to replace the exist cost regime for right to manage claim be flawed and need overhaul if it be to protect in practice rtm company from cost claim by landlord we also believe that this limited bill can be improve in way that will give future leaseholder more control over their future for example we think there be an iron clothe case for add to the bill provision that would abolish forfeiture for lease entirely and replace it with more equitable mean for freeholder to recover cost in dispute that do not involve windfall be pleased by the signal that the secretary of state give on that front in open the debate to take another example we think there be merit in add to the bill provision that would ensure that lease on new flat include requirement to establish and operate resident management company responsible for all service charge matter and associate work with each leaseholder give share we will seek to convince the government of the merit of those and other measure when we go into committee in the new year and we will engage constructively with the government if they decide to introduce other bold measure into the bill at that stage for example if ministers be minded to implement the law commission proposal on the right to manage cover both flat and house however we recognise that there be only so much that we can do with the legislation before we give the paucity of the bill ambition and the fact that it do not contain so many of the commitment that successive secretaries of state have make not least in relation to the promise widespread introduction of the commonhold tenure it be clear that it will now fall to labour government to fundamentally and comprehensively reform the leasehold system include the reinvigoration of commonhold to such an extent that it will become the default and ultimately render leasehold obsolete we be pleased that the bill will progress today it will provide some limited relief to leaseholder we will seek to improve it with view to extract from the government any extra measure that far empower leaseholder and disturb the historical iniquity on which the present system rest leaseholder across the country who remain at the mercy of arcane and discriminatory practice to their detriment and to the benefit of freeholder rightly expect nothing less but leaseholder across the country expect so much more from the government we be clear that in due course labour will have to finish the job and enact all the law commission recommendation on enfranchisement right to manage and commonhold in full we be determined to do so it be pleasure to wind up the debate after so many useful thoughtful and detailed contribution in that spirit want to spend little time go through some of those detail before do so wish to thank as so many other have all the campaigner and all those who have spend so much time work in this area for so many year thank my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts my hon friend the member for redditch rachel maclean the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms my hon friend the member for dartford gareth johnson the hon member for battersea marsha de cordova my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton the hon member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken the hon member for city of chester samantha dixon my hon friend the member for north norfolk duncan baker the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy the hon member for liverpool west derby ian byrne and all those who intervene for the helpful comment they provide welcome the general and broad support for the action that be be take in the bill also welcome the consensus in the house on the need for reform which know as be highlight several time have be some time come hope right hon and hon member will recognise that this be complicated and intricate area which be observable not least from the many example give in the debate we now have in front of we good proposition for make progress our focus in the bill be on be able to make practical progress to make the bill as practically useful as it can be and then to have the great impact that it can have some include hon member tonight have say that it do not go far enough other have say that we should return to first principle and seek to build the whole system again be sure that those hon member will make their case in committee if they be part of it and on report and in subsequent stage the government seek to have proposition on which can be build one that be practical achievable and make difference the art of politic be about be able to make progress and we think that the bill will make significant difference to people life let turn to some comment make in the debate pay tribute to the long stand work of the father of the house my hon friend the member for worthe west he raise number of point which we will go through in more detail in committee but want to highlight his point on build safety with regard to metre property number of member make similar comment we have process in place so if colleague have concern about fire remediation issue in metre property they should ensure that they get the appropriate fire assessment need in all building if substantial work be need to those property they can be raise with the department which have commit at this dispatch box and have execute commitment to look into those issue in more detail pay tribute to the work of the select committee chair by my constituency neighbour the hon member for sheffield south east particularly enjoy our interaction on this issue because it give like he the opportunity repeatedly to say as constituency mp how outraged be about coppen estates consistent failure to respond that be hallmark of small cohort of actor in this area which consistently and flagrantly ignore reality and their ability to make difference to our resident life coppen estates be good example of such actor but there be many other thank the minister for respond to that point will he look at strengthen the bill to stop company like coppen estates avoid the legislation strengthen the legislation be fine and so be change the way that enfranchisement fee be calculate so that people get well deal but in the end the freeholder have to respond which coppen estates refuse to do my constituent in the flockton estate in sheffield have try and fail for year to get response how will the legislation be strengthen to ensure that such company respond be very happy to look at specific issue in committee as the secretary of state highlight in his opening speech if there be area where we can improve the bill we will be happy to do so can not make promise but we be happy to look at they the hon gentleman constituent in sheffield my constituent in dronfield and constituent all across the country have similar issue to those with coppen estates so hope we will be able to make progress the hon gentleman the hon member for battersea and other rightly talk about leaseholder not know what they be pay for few week ago have the privilege of take part in two hour discussion with one of the well estate manager about an issue in my constituency in hunloke grove they be willing to go into detail talk about the issue work through and be transparent on their fee in way that so many other manage agent be not the importance of that come home to in that discussion my hon friend the member for redditch should rightly take all the credit for where we be today be surf on all her work over many month to get the bill ready she deserve huge amount of credit for that she be an exceptional housing minister and have make some extremely constructive comment today which we will look at along with the similar comment from my hon friend the member for north norfolk can confirm that our intention be that there will be sufficient time to be clear on ground rent as my hon friend the member for redditch rightly say it be so important that we secure property own democracy for the next generation thank the right hon member for east ham for make series of important point which be happy to look at the government be happy to see whether they be possible he make specific point about asbestos which we will take away and review with the detail it deserve look forward to the visit to barrier point which want to make follow his correspondence it be important that on build safety we look at not just the overall macro picture but individual circumstance to see whether we can learn anything be also grateful to the right hon member for give this opportunity to make the point about insurance from the dispatch box be as keen as he to see progress on insurance have meet representative of the insurance sector on very regular basis in the year that have be in post hope that they will hold to their intention they have tell we that they will launch the scheme and we be keen to see it the secretary of state further meeting this week will hope enable progress my hon friend the member for dartford make extremely important point on estate management he have continually articulate the challenge on regular basis and have be champion on this matter he rightly speak of the outrage he have see in his constituency it be important that we respond to that as good we can be grateful to my hon friend the member for harrow east for highlight number of the important change that be come he be right that our objective be to squeeze out the bad practice in the sector there be honourable people out there and there be honourable way in which it be do but where bad practice occur it give the entire sector bad name we will legislate and regulate to remove it in proportionate way my hon friend also highlight an example of property that have not yet make progress on remediation and similar example be give by the hon member for brentford and isleworth and for walthamstow and my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster we can see significant progress we have only recently produce new detailed set of datum cover all the fund that be open on build safety hope hon member will see the progress that have be make but we recognise that there be more to do the hon member for walthamstow be absolutely right that there be number of name that pop up repeatedly for example management and there be many other and they should be on notice that they need to change their practice because they be not acceptable the minister touch on build safety in the briefing note on the bill that accompany the king speech under the head improve leaseholder consumer right reference be make to build on the legislation bring forward by the building safety act be it the government intention to incorporate build safety measure in the bill we be look at what may be possible we recognise that while the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have bring forward very solid prospectus tweak can always be make we see real momentum in this area know that that be not good enough for building that have not yet have their remediation or for leaseholder who be hugely frustrate by the inability or unwillingness of freeholder to make progress but we have make significant change and step forward in the last year or so and we be commit to do more in the come month be grateful to the hon member for north shropshire for meet early to talk about specific point about asset we will look at those point and come back to she can confirm to my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills that we intend to tackle ground rent be grateful to she for highlight exception in leasehold house we intend that to be very narrow element she seek an example one example can give be that of national trust land where freehold can not be sell and small number of leasehold home may therefore be require the hon member for liverpool west derby talk about his disappointment with believe the consultation on ground rent we must consult on that because we must ensure that we be listen and that we take decision base on the broad range of evidence in front of we to ensure that it be legally sound when the decision be make he encourage to speak to the law commission can tell he that have speak to the law commission probably more regularly than any other external organisation outside the department in the past three or four week the hon member for walthamstow for battersea and for brentford and isleworth be seek to push narrative if may say that very gently to they with the good of intention that this be not significant intervention with regard to flat gently encourage they to continue to engage with the bill they will see long and cheap extension easy enfranchisement service charge transparency easy redress lease extension standard form annual report and many many other significant measure that will have salience for those live in flat before conclude would like to thank the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook for his constructive comment look forward to meet he in committee to talk about they more while may disappoint the right hon member for east ham would like to turn to some of the comment make from the opposition front bench the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner despite acknowledge that the government have bring forward important legislation despite confirm that labour would not be oppose it and despite advance the most enthusiastic compliment have ever hear she give conservative that the secretary of state have reach the lofty height of be functional cog heavy praise that as ever she deal in rhetoric rather than reality and in politic rather than policy she call the bill empty this be bill with clause eight schedule and page and there be page of explanatory note give its comprehensive reform of enfranchisement and extension its comprehensive reform of redress and its comprehensive reform of service charge estate management and valuation that be funny definition of empty ask the minister to answer this question in sum up the debate will he undertake to include the outcome of the consultation that be currently take place particularly that on ground rent in the amendment that the government table in committee that be our intention yes we have have good debate today which hope indeed know will start the passage of this important bill into law and lead to well system for everyone in the long term this be an outcome that be fundamentally conservative because fundamentally the bill be about empower people about level the playing field where it have be distort about rein in those who be try to rent seek for no purpose at the expense of those who just want to get on with live their life and about give people the security of home ownership proper home ownership for the long term so that they can build their life and build their future hope that all member will join the government in support the bill tonight and look forward to further constructive conversation during its future stage question put and agree to bill accordingly read

etc housing availability ilfracombe motion make and question propose that this house do now pm be very proud to be ilfracombe mp it be tight knit resilient community of and so remote that it have to be self sufficient it be mile from barnstaple the major town in northern devon and almost mile from devon county town the city of exeter at the start of the pandemic it make national news by be the first community to fully develop delivery and support network across the town and the community continue to look after its own and all those who visit ilfracombe be both rural and coastal with stunning harbour hardy fishing fleet and its own lifeboat station reflect the treacherous coastline and rugged cliff it be one of those seaside town that be popular with the victorians but then get cut off with the closure of the train line in the it have suffer from under investment ever since tourism remain the no industry of the town this create its own challenge with many small business choose not to register for vat and closing at the threshold leave swathe of employee in seasonal work and on out of season benefit however ilfracombe be not low wage economy it be low skill economy some of have no qualification at all often lead big employer in the town to recruit internationally and break down job into those that match the skill we see far too many of our bright youngster head off to university never to return the south west suffer from youth exodus with the high number of to year old and the high number of student leave of any region that have implication for those leave behind school attainment gap in the south west between poor pupil and the rest be the large of all english region at the end of both primary and secondary school and that be not to mention the recruitment retention and training challenge that exist for isolated and remote school and the low level of school funding and teacher pay ilfracombe have the second big catchment of any secondary school in the country with absenteeism run at which be similar number to the percentage of people in ilfracombe who have never work and will never work at all deprivation run deep in ilfracombe as foreign holiday become the norm old hotel become home in multiple occupation ilfracombe even feature in the comedy show bread as somewhere to move to and some of those old hotel become care setting for those with addiction and no housing elsewhere in the country to be move to we have ward in ilfracombe where over quarter of the population be register disabled under the term of the equality act the town be still litter with derelict building and have large building unoccupied they be fall down and intermittently one be burn to the ground surely there must be more that can be do to tackle these derelict building and bring they back into use ilfracombe have the low healthy life expectancy of any rural town in the country and life expectancy over decade below that of the healthy town in devon there be not big queue for healthcare in ilfracombe people often do not even present despite lifestyle choice contribute to poor health there be an acceptance that thing be good enough but they be not have attend more meeting on the issue of deprivation and health inequality in ilfracombe than care to list people care deeply about the issue in the town but solution be hard to come by which be why have come to the chamber to ask the minister and his department to help we be elect on manifesto of level up and on any metric whatsoever ilfracombe clearly need to be level up yet the resource to tackle the root cause of the problem be not forthcoming have see endless piece of analysis know that the primary issue be shockingly poor housing some of the population in ilfracombe rent and give that we have no university student that be staggeringly high post pandemic house price have jump by which be one of the high rate in the country that be understandable as it be beautiful place to live but suffice it to say that wage have not increase by the same level we have lose almost two third of long term rental mostly to short term holiday let and far too many of the remain rental property be substandard the council be apparently powerless to intervene unless there be something like fire and the picture that have circulate to the department of the condition that family be live in be unacceptable commend the hon lady for bring this debate forward speak to she beforehand and understand the issue clearly she have outline the issue of tourism fishing and youth unemployment in north devon and now the issue of housing as representative of the small harbour village of portavogie in my constituency of strangford fully understand the pressure of find affordable housing in these little community do she not agree that social housing in rural community must be priority to enable people to remain with the family support that they have and the friendship they have make over the year entirely agree with the hon gentleman will talk about affordable housing and as he represent coastal constituency be sure he will recognise what be about to say storm batter the north devon coastline at this time of year and old hotel shabbily convert into flat some with no insulation be take the element week after week and should be condemn but the last thing we need be even more derelict building that no one will do anything with because ilfracombe be only small part of north devon the metric use to determine where the first round of levelling up funding be spend mean that we be in the low category and our tiny district council do not have lot of potential bid ready to go for ilfracombe strong bid be submit although it be ultimately unsuccessful but we all know it be not go to level up ilfracombe it be just to secure some funding at the time senior council officer raise the issue of housing and what be really need but the levelling up fund be all about transport and tourism not housing be grateful to the new chief executive of devon county council who arrive this spring from the remote and rural highland see the deprivation in my constituency and she be in my office week after her appointment to ask what be go on with ilfracombe since her arrival and renew focus more councillor and council officer than ever before have head north of tiverton and make it up to ilfracombe to see the problem be the only mp on the devon housing commission which have also visit it be hard to reconcile the fact that we be not worthy of level up when we have family look at their second christmas in holiday park because there be not single home available for they in northern devon indeed not single affordable home have be build in ilfracombe since the first be now under construction but as another district council leader say during the presentation of these fact to the devon housing commission be this not dereliction of duty indeed it be although our tiny district council know that there be problem it do not have the resource to deliver solution at the end of the pandemic my county council tell that my constituency be home to five of the most deprive ward in all of devon my question be what be you go to do it be only with the new chief executive arrival that proposal have be forthcoming six cost proposal with different element to tackle housing and skill be with the department be grateful to the previous levelling up minister my hon friend the member for bishop auckland dehenna davison for visit ilfracombe and meet the council and be grateful for the engagement of the current levelling up minister my hon friend the member for redcar jacob young very much hope that the promise meeting will deliver plan as quite simply north devon and ilfracombe do not have the resource to resolve the housing situation on their own my frustration at the multiple tier of local government which have result in so much talk and so little delivery be great we simply have to tackle some of the housing issue in the town before we can tackle the other be delighted that family hub for the town will be forthcoming on average because devon county council cover huge area many thing in devon look fine or at least not bad which hide pocket of deep deprivation in place like ilfracombe and we have miss out on far too many scheme and pot of money because the average look fine but do not take into account the variance across the county will the new devolution deal deliver anything to ilfracombe unfortunately time and again we see money go to urban centre and not reach small community that be equally in need liberal democrat run north devon district council be apparently able to deliver only one project at time have the pleasure of spending friday morning with the council leader who explain why the bus station in barnstaple could not be upgrade because the council be too busy with the future high street project to tackle second issue have confidence in the council officer if not the political leadership to understand what need to be do but there be resource issue of both people and finance if we need to attract external funding to tackle some of these housing challenge we do not have the experience of manage such project well we desperately need responsible social landlord to take on some of the property in ilfracombe bring they up to standard and maintain they again when will there be progress on the registration scheme for short term rental will the minister ask the treasury to level up the tax inequality between long term and short term rental to attract long term landlord back to the market all that happen at present be that we seem to get more retirement property second home and property be snap up as holiday let as of yesterday there be rental property in ilfracombe be advertise on rightmove and on airbnb the minister have tell that there be not fund that my council bid can be accept into at this time but give that deep dive have be do into other seaside location that replicate ilfracombe position just on far big scale be there really no opportunity to look hard at these small coastal community and the challenge they face my father be head of large coastal comprehensive in the middle of council estate back in the and the issue he face there be identical to the one face in north devon when retrain to teach just ahead of my election to this place we have to tackle social mobility and educational outcome but when people can not afford to stay in their community because of lack of affordable housing and business have no incentive to grow because of the vat tax threshold it be hard to drive aspiration as concept the frustration that the government be spend money overseas to house people who come to our shore illegally when we can not house our own be immense all ask be that some resource be give to tackle what be shocking statistic at any level and leave ilfracombe as the third most deprive rural town anywhere in the country we know from so many piece of research the stat on coastal community and we must seek to level up some of these small community that be not big enough to stand out in national statistic level up be suppose to reach into all community not just big town and city be very proud of the ilfracombe community it be have fantastic church and community leader who work tirelessly to try to tackle the issue the town face and look after their population however give the long term intergenerational nature of the issue and the level of investment need we do need some help now that we have plan to tackle issue we be step far forward than we be when first raise the issue of ilfracombe in this place see no point in try to make political point out of this for almost year nothing have be do by council of all different colour to tackle the problem the government have highlight the need to level up and very much want the next generation to be able to afford to stay and work in the high tech green industry that we hope will be come ashore along our coast very much hope that the minister will be able to provide some hope that we may at last be able to tackle some of the root cause of the deprivation ilfracombe suffer and in particular tackle its housing supply let start by thank my hon friend the member for north devon selaine saxby for the opportunity to debate these important issue as it be vital that member have the opportunity to discuss they make sure that there be viable aspirant and successful town all across the country be hugely important part of our job one that motivate to come to this place on behalf of north east derbyshire know that it clearly motivate my hon friend to do the same for north devon department for levelling up housing and communities official be pleased to hold recent roundtable in ilfracombe which she mention official and agency have productive discussion about some of the opportunity and challenge that she have rightly highlight and some of the point about support also recognise she for the important work that she do with the devon housing commission on which as she say she serve and be look forward to see the result of that work want to spend second just champion she in general as she be one of the most diligent member of this house she be so utterly engage in the issue that be important to her constituent and it be so important that that be the case know that north devon resident will be very grateful for all the work she do obviously housing be vital for the government long term plan for economic recovery in july the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my right hon friend the member for surrey heath michael gove set out long term plan for housing to usher in new era of regeneration and housing delivery all across england we be talk not only about more house but house in the right place that be absolutely seek to service and support local demand we be on track to achieve our manifesto commitment to deliver more than million home over the course of this parliament since april more than million home have be deliver and four of the high annual period for housing supply in the past year have come in the past half decade or so it be absolutely vital that we build more house but we need to build they in the right place and in way that respond to local demand as my hon friend have say we will continue to work with homes england have already meet my hon friend number of time to discuss the matter but my offer to work in partnership with her remain so we can see what we can do for north devon in the long term as well as constituency around the country my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of aspiration which we know can be challenge in some of our small town we must ensure that we be not just give people thing as important as they be lot of the discussion about level up have be about thing we need to give they the tool to go and change their life for the well if we can inculcate aspiration into our kid as they go through school and into our community as people build their life and business and if we can ensure aspiration be at the core of everything we do that be fundamentally conservative prospectus upon which to make our community even strong it be also the most successful way to make our community strong in the long term the new funding announce in the autumn statement through the levelling up partnership the further investment zone the new investment opportunity fund and other funding for transformative project across the country will make real difference in area where funding have be agree and where it will come in the month ahead ilfracombe have benefit from government funding to support increase housing and infrastructure include the brownfield land release fund which will provide self build and custom build property in bicclescombe devon in addition million from the housing infrastructure fund have be make available for the ilfracombe southern extension however take my hon friend point that much more need to be do and be happy to work with she on that we remain committed to create housing system that work include increase first time buyer in every single region across the country we be operate range of scheme include first home share ownership and mortgage guarantee scheme all of which aim to increase the supply of low deposit mortgage and the availability of new housing and to stimulate economic growth we know that first time buyer can often struggle to afford to buy home in the area where they live and work have speak to my hon friend previously about those challenge in north devon key worker can find themselves unable to live in the community they serve as my hon friend highlight initiative such as the first home scheme while not perfect allow local exemption to be set under key worker criterion hope that communitie up and down the land that be face those challenge be able to use those scheme but we recognise that there be always long conversation to have on that issue my hon friend be right to raise the basic point of fairness this week we will be talk about number of other issue in this place tomorrow we will be talk about those who come to our shore illegally she be right to highlight the view of her constituent that there have to be basic fairness with people come to this country so that we can make the case that the work we do on level up work for the long term hope we can make progress on that specific and broad point tomorrow my hon friend and also speak recently about community land trust as way to support housing supply that meet the need of the local community the community lead approach to house building involve community base group take responsibility for drive forward local house building scheme that support and the close involvement of local community enable the securing of planning permission and the delivery of housing on site hope that that be possibility in north devon in the future we have already speak several time since be appoint as housing minister few week ago about the importance of get clarity for my hon friend and other colleague in devon cornwall and elsewhere regard short term let in debate in westminster hall number of week ago we talk about the importance of tourism for area such as north devon and the importance of clarity about what be happen with regard to short term let while be still unable to give specific timetable my hon friend and her colleague in the south west have impress upon we all in government the urgency of provide clarity about both the register and what we intend to do with the planning use class we will try to move forward on that as quickly as we can and give clarity to community such as north devon as soon as possible thank my hon friend for prompt this important debate and give we the opportunity even in small way to discuss ilfracombe both the opportunity and the challenge and to recognise that there be much more conversation to be have outside this chamber with regard to its future place such as ilfracombe just like place such as north east derbyshire which have the privilege to represent have hugely bright future if we can give community the tool to get on and make those community as aspirational as they can be we need to ensure that government support work for the long term and continue the very good conversation that my hon friend have start and on which she be at the forefront to ensure that she be champion place such as north devon for the long term question put and agree to house adjourn
