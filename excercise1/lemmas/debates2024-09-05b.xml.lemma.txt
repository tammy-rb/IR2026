the minister shake his head but if we have shut down all that capacity if we can not generate the electricity ourselves we will have to get it from other place there be phenomenon call wind drought which can go on for very long period what be we go to do when the wind turbine be not turn and the sun be not shin during very cold spell in the middle of winter we have one or two close scare this winter the generate margin that we use to enjoy have go the great risk of accelerate the decarbonisation of the electricity system be that there will be more appeal for voluntary or compulsory restraint from industry because industry be the hide customer that be shut off when we be short of electricity or we risk more brownout or even blackout that not impossible so where be the datum that the minister be place so much confidence in that show these forecast to be wrong be not make they off my own bat there be plenty of people out there make they that bring to the final brief point want to make understand the logic that the minister explain in his letter to absolutely share that ambition but the question be how quickly we can get there at the moment tidal power produce almost nothing as proportion of our electricity requirement it be also intermittent by the way four time day there be period during which it do not generate anything and we need to replace that supply with other thing the real challenge be how we get to the objective that the hon gentleman and share in rational way that carry the british public with we it be noticeable that what people be complain about most be the price on their electricity bill today the constraint cost balance cost infrastructure cost and import cost that mention make up perhaps of domestic electricity bill if that figure be wrong let the minister produce some figure of his own that explain what proportion of consumer bill arise from all those factor because it be not explain there be no transparency on our electricity bill on the hon gentleman point about the objective of decarbonisation we be not go to get there at all if we lose the public if the light start brown out or go out and we find that we can not meet demand to some extent we be pile up that demand by decarbonise transport and other part of the system include decarbonise building heat through heat pump the demand for electricity will rise but our capacity to produce it reliably at all hour and in all condition be be reduce on the question of import and export we might become net exporter of electricity but perhaps the hon gentleman can explain how the price at which we be export compare with the price at which we be import the difficulty be that we will be import when the wind be not blow or the sun be not shin and it be likely that the wind will not be blow across the entirety of the north sea so we will be import fossil fuel generate power at very high cost to compensate for the fact that we have get rid of our own gas production and gas fire power station be not sure that situation will be very good if the hon gentleman would look at the arup report on the tarchon interconnector which will come into my constituency under the present plan he will see that that interconnector will not actually contribute very much to security of supply but will be use almost entirely to export when there be too much wind it will export at below the strike price because there be too much wind and it will export at loss and the cost will finish up on the bill of the british consumer so the british consumer be pay for all the investment pay for the strike price pay for the infrastructure and then pay to subsidise the export to the germans who will be the beneficiary of all this investment appeal to the minister to just read the arup report and look at this that be why ask about the offshore co ordination support scheme work that have be do be not go to ask for the impossible and ask he to revive the ocss but would like from he an assurance that the work eso have do will not simply be throw away and waste please can he assure the house that that work will be incorporate into the spatial plan that eso say it want to produce some very interesting innovation come out of that work but there be also lot of work discredit the long term viability of norwich to tilbury and look on different timeframe in the long term that could produce much more viable alternative than be currently on the table there be still work to be do on that but have no doubt that fintan slye will want to do that work as part of his project for the government would like to know that the minister be go to support the holistic approach to which the secretary of state refer because norwich to tilbury be certainly not the product of strategic approach to electricity grid upgrading we need much more strategic approach and be look for that from this government but it certainly will not come from this bill
