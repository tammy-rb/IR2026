oral answers to questions foreign commonwealth and development office the minister of state be ask gaza what recent diplomatic step he have take to help secure sustainable ceasefire in gaza what diplomatic step he be take to help end the conflict in israel and gaza what recent discussion he have have with his counterpart in israel on the number of civilian death in gaza what recent diplomatic step he have take to help secure sustainable ceasefire in gaza we be call for an immediate humanitarian pause in order to get aid in and hostage out as vital step towards sustainable permanent ceasefire that be all very well but the problem be that netanyahu and the israeli government be simply ignore all the plea for restraint those plea have become empty word what will the government do to put real pressure on the israelis to stop the unacceptable killing enter into negotiation for permanent ceasefire and stop the threat to permanently annex and occupy gaza have the time come to stop sell to israel arm that be be use to raze gaza to the ground as tell the house yesterday the foreign secretary be in the region today and will pursue the vital policy that the hon gentleman have set out the hon gentleman will know that it be an absolute priority for britain to ensure that more aid get in but the israeli government have the right of self defence and as the uk government continually make clear they must exercise that right within international humanitarian law like many other member be sure have receive an extraordinary number of email from constituent who be deeply concerned about what be go on these be people who would never normally get in touch with their mp we must stop the killing my party and believe that an immediate bilateral ceasefire be the way forward what step be the government take with partner in the region and around the world to achieve that end all of we want ceasefire but it must be sustainable that be why the british government be bent on ensure that we get humanitarian pause so that we can get far more supply into gaza and on the back of that sustainable ceasefire as say in answer to the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts we need pause in order to get aid and support in and the hostage out accord to the un world food programme over half million palestinians in gaza be starve famine be imminent allegation against united nations relief and works agency staff be rightly be investigate but cut aid to unrwa entirely be disproportionate and punitive have the minister even consider the consequence of those cut on woman baby and the seriously injure and do he understand that they would breach the measure issue by the international court of justice to ensure that aid flow into gaza as have set out to the house repeatedly we be do everything we can along with other to ensure that vital supply get into gaza for the very reason that the hon lady set out on unrwa it would be impossible for any of we to continue business as usual give the appalling event outline over the weekend that be why we have make it clear that we will not produce further finance until we be satisfied that those matter have be address with regard to what we be seek to do through unrwa now we have provide additional funding in the past and that will ensure that aid and vital supply get into gaza the government have consistently repeat their commitment to two state solution and that be right but for year israel have deliberately undermine that through the settlement of the west bank in contravention of international law now netanyahu have come clean and rule out two state solution so do the minister agree that if the uk policy be to be see as anything more than empty word we need to demonstrate our commitment to viable palestinian state by recognise it and by upgrade current government advice against trade with the illegal settlement to full embargo the government position on the issue of illegal settlement be absolutely clear in respect of the two state solution would point out to the hon gentleman that progress have be make previously in particular after grievous act of terrible conflict and terrorism that be when the big leap forward towards resolution of this desperate problem have be make we hope that on the back of the horrendous event that have take place on october and since additional progress can be make as soon as the political track can be restart the palestinian authority grip on security control across the west bank have be push out by the malevolent force of hamas palestinian islamic jihad and local terror group fund by iran be it not the case that unilateral recognition of palestinian state now would risk equip those dangerous actor with the trimming and capability of state the british government have always be clear that we intend to recognise palestinian state when the timing be right my right hon and learn friend will have hear the comment that the foreign secretary make last night which in no way deviate from that policy the foreign secretary be point out how important it be to ensure that people can see that when political track get go real progress can be make if we can not have ceasefire humanitarian pause would of course be very welcome but it will only be of any use if we can get the aid that be so urgently require into gaza what be the government do to overcome what the foreign secretary have describe as the ludicrous check regime put in place by the israelis and what more can we do to stop or avoid crowd of israelis from gather at crossing into gaza aim to prevent aid from enter and so obviate famine on my right hon friend second point can assure he that we be in regular touch with all the relevant authority to try to ensure that do not hinder the entry of aid on his first point we should all be aware that the issue be not that there be not enough aid in the region but that it be not get in that be why the government under the prime minister specific instruction have be investigate how to get aid in through all mean include from the sea and from naval corridor it be really disturbing that bbc online be report that the foreign secretary have change the uk government approach on recognition of palestinian state do the minister agree that bring forward and accelerate unilateral recognition of palestinian state would be to reward hamas atrocity my right hon friend will be aware that there be no question of reward hamas for the appalling act they perpetrate in pogrom on october the point that the foreign secretary have be make be that we must give the people of the west bank and gaza credible route to palestinian state and new future but we must do so when the time be right call the shadow minister the minister will know that there be rise anger in the region about the desperate situation in gaza which make ceasefire much hard to achieve more people be now die of hunger and thirst than from bomb and bullet he say yesterday that the uk be pause funding to unrwa not cut it but give its critical role will he reassure we that nothing will disrupt the supply of aid not just into gaza but through gaza now and in the month ahead he be right that these be serious allegation and we should be robust about how uk aid money be spend but it would be unconscionable if we allow anything to stand in the way of uk aid reach those child right now will he promise that the uk will move heaven and earth to get that aid to they the shadow minister for development be absolutely right about the balance that have to be strike of course we need to investigate rapidly the very serious allegation that have be make against unrwa but the asset we use for get aid and support into gaza depend on the asset that unrwa own warehouse vehicle and the other distribution mechanism as such we need that inquiry to be complete as rapidly as possible in the meanwhile britain be not intend to give any further support to unrwa in this financial year in the next financial year we will consider the position in precisely the way the shadow minister set out west philippine sea whether he be take diplomatic step to help reduce the risk of conflict in the west philippine sea the uk be commit to the primacy of the united nations convention on the law of the sea and to freedom of navigation and overflight we oppose any action that raise tension or the risk of miscalculation in the south china sea the foreign secretary speak to his philippino counterpart in december and the fcdo issue statement on december condemn chinese unsafe and escalatory action against the philippines declare an interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group for the philippines the minister be no doubt aware of large number of video post on youtube and other outlet show chinese gunboat ram and victimise philippine fisherman in the west philippine sea this be vital industry for the economy of the philippines which as she know be one of our key strategic partner in the region what discussion have she have with her chinese counterpart to stop those unprovoked attack and allow those peaceful fisherman simply to go about earn livelihood to support their family be in vietnam in october speak at the south china sea conference and set out very clearly the uk position and raise the serious risk which my hon friend highlight pose by these instance of unsafe conduct against philippino fishing vessel the uk have provide million in funding to support regional partner through an enhance programme of maritime security capacity building in south east asia which include training on the law of the sea and we continue to provide that support to help maintain that free and open pacific thank the minister for that response china be quite clearly thuggish country bully country that think it can step upon anybody they have an insatiable demand and appetite for everybody else resource when will the time come that china will understand that they can not bully the wee person that we will stand with that wee person against they the hon gentleman set out really important position and we want to continue to support and work closely with the philippines be able to co chair the first uk philippines strategic dialogue in november where we be continue to work with the philippines across number of front on how we can support they to ensure that they can sustain their agency and present themselves the position as he highlight of want to be able to use their waterway freely and unencumbered palestinian state recognition what recent discussion he have have with his israeli counterpart on israel political objective in gaza what plan the government have to recognise palestinian state what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of the recognition of palestinian state what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of the recognition of palestinian state we be clear that for peaceful solution to this conflict there must be political horizon towards two state solution britain will recognise palestinian state at time when it well serve the objective of peace bilateral recognition alone can not end the occupation give the evidence of war crime and crime against humanity commit by israel and now recognition by the international court of justice of the risk of genocide be commit by israel have the uk government seek to ascertain what the israeli military objective be in gaza and do the minister agree with the motion table by the scottish national party at the council of europe last week support by nine nation and member that an immediate ceasefire and resettlement scheme for those bomb out of gaza by israel be absolutely essential have not see the motion table by the snp and probably would not agree with it if have we be always focused on address the point that the hon lady have make when it come to the international court of justice and indeed international humanitarian law the government view be not the same as hers but she may rest assure that we keep these thing under very close review there be now live ongoing investigation by the icj into genocide in gaza give the british government reluctance thus far to recognise the state of palestine do the minister not understand that failure to do so will soon result in the uk government just recognise cemetery the government position and indeed believe the position of those on the opposition front bench have always be clear we should recognise the state of palestine when the time be right the foreign secretary last night add some further word to that commitment but that be the commitment of the british government last night the foreign secretary indicate that the uk government will consider recognise the palestinian state in order to give the palestinian people political horizon so that they can see that there be go to be irreversible progress to two state solution can the minister explain how that be possible when both the israeli national security minister and the finance minister have advocate use the ongoing war as an opportunity to permanently resettle palestinians from gaza and establish israeli settlement there and the israeli prime minister have openly say he be proud to have prevent the establishment of palestinian state the foreign secretary be make it clear that we need credible route to palestinian state and the offer of new future it be very important to lift people eye to the possibility once political track be establish point out to the hon gentleman that progress have be make progress that be make at oslo take place on the back of appalling event when people reach for political solution the same be true of what follow the second intifada the aim of the british government be to get sustainable ceasefire and move to that political track my right hon friend comment about big leap forward be noble recognise that but as long as hamas who believe not in two state solution but in kill and rap jews cle on in gaza as fatah be barely able to control the west bank and as israel be still in trauma still try to get hostage include baby back from gaza what do he think that talk about early recognition of palestinian statehood can achieve recognise the voracity of what my right hon friend say but there be no change in the policy he be right that hamas must agree to the release of all hostage that hamas can no long be in charge of gaza and that we need an agreement to provide governance service and security there which will involve the palestinian authority the foreign secretary in his meeting with president abbas last week seek to advance that agenda on sunday third of knesset members attend conference call for the return of settlement to gaza and to the north of the occupy west bank some of those member have also ask for voluntary migration of palestinians from gaza with israel take over control do the minister agree that that be not in the good interest of israel and that there should be return to the border with both country work together to maintain peace in the interest of their citizen yes do the only viable long term pathway be two state solution base on line with jerusalem as share capital that guarantee security and stability for both israelis and palestinians surely the only political objective in gaza be inextricably link to the security objective because the grim reality be that hamas do not seek ceasefire and israel can not be reasonably expect to pursue one with group who actively seek its destruction not least the commitment make by senior hamas official ghazi hamad who recently say we must teach israel lesson and we will do this again and again and that the october massacre be just the first time and there will be second third fourth the only political solution must be the elimination of hamas and the release of the hostage that be why the government have make it clear that call for ceasefire on its own will simply not work first israel absolutely have the right of self defence to address and deal with the cause of the terrible event of october secondly hamas have make it absolutely clear that they do not want ceasefire they want to replicate the event that take place on october call the shadow foreign secretary for decade now the labour party have support palestinian recognition as my right hon and learn friend the member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer have say statehood be not in the gift of neighbour it be the inalienable right of the palestinian people welcome the foreign secretary adopt that position and reject the notion that recognition can only follow the conclusion of negotiation after the unacceptable comment by prime minister netanyahu do the prime minister agree that no country have veto over the uk decision to recognise palestine can tell the shadow foreign secretary that we will pursue the policy that we think be right the foreign secretary set out clearly in his remark last night the importance of credible route to palestinian state and new future in respect of the conversation that the foreign secretary will have have last week with prime minister netanyahu can not trade the detail across the house but can tell the right hon gentleman that the foreign secretary will have represent the british position with prime minister netanyahu whom he know very well with great accuracy call the snp spokesperson palestinian recognition be an inalienable right not privilege to be confer by other although be pleased to hear the foreign secretary say last night that the uk with ally will look at the issue of recognise palestinian state feel we have be here before most notably in give netanyahu categorical rejection of palestinian state what be the next step when will we hear about they and how confident can we be that we will not be sit here in another year wish we have act to prevent genocide it be not easy to sustain the view that we have be here before at least not to this extent the british government policy have be clear on the recognition of the state of palestine we be work extremely hard in the region and more widely internationally to secure political track the hon gentleman will recognise that that will be in the mix once that political track be able to start climate change adaptation what step his department be take to support develop country with climate change adaptation we be committed to spend billion on climate adaptation by extreme weather be already cause huge devastation especially in the poor community across the world who be also the least likely to find investor or to borrow from global financial institution at there be breakthrough and loss and damage fund have finally be establish however the money for the uk contribution will come from pre exist climate finance commitment and the development budget should the government in the spirit of what the loss and damage fund represent not establish new ringfenced loss and damage budget that be not take from other budget we do support set up the loss and damage fund at and we contribute specifically towards it however it be important that loss and damage do not draw from the same donor and the same official development assistance budget as other development it have to be different it be because the uae as non traditional donor put in million to that fund that britain be willing to support it but we need new and different donor and new and different source of fund welcome the extremely important work the government be do in protect vulnerable community around the world will the minister confirm to that the billion that the government have commit for save nature will be use on some of the very vulnerable habitat site and animal around the world such as those environmental audit committee see on recent visit to antarctica will he particularly think about whale fur seal and of course the emperor penguin will think about all the mammal my hon friend have mention can assure he that our commitment be to biodiversity and to nature we recognise the great importance of the work be do in the antarctic and indeed the contribution that he make to that call the shadow foreign secretary from the flood to the fire from melt ice sheet to ocean heat the climate crisis be reach tipping point labour have plan at home double onshore wind treble solar and end new oil and gas licence in the north sea labour have plan internationally clean power alliance of developed and develop country to drive forward the transition be it not the truth that the government have no plan and have squander britain climate reputation to wage culture war at home the reason the government be able to reduce the size of electricity bill for hard work family be precisely because we be meet our target and will meet our international commitment britain international target and commitment be enshrine in law as result of the activity of this house internationally we be committed as the right hon gentleman know and as be set out to the house towards the end of last year to spend billion on ensure that we meet our climate target and produce climate finance would argue that that figure will be near billion by debt reduction in the developing world whether he have have recent discussion with his international counterpart on strategy to reduce debt in the develop world the government recently set out our commitment on develop country debt in our international development white paper the main mechanism to tackle the debt crisis the common framework for debt treatment be fail due to the low level of participation by private creditor who own around of low income country debt do the minister agree that there be strategic need for the united kingdom to take debt reduction seriously and change its approach give the crisis in africa and the grow role of china and russia in the develop world the hon lady be right to point to the considerable difficulty that country be find some of low income country be in debt distress and be at high risk of that the african development bank say that debt repayment in be likely to be six time the level of that be why britain be work with other creditor to secure debt restructuring most often through the common framework but also through the paris club middle east conflict prevention what recent step he have take to help prevent an escalation of conflict in the middle east the government be engage extensively to prevent an escalation of conflict in the middle east the prime minister speak to president biden last week about that specific issue think we can all understand the anger towards israel for the way it be systematically demolish gaza and needlessly kill so many of the people as well as the need for it to be properly hold to account do the minister recognise that we must do everything to protect against other join the conflict and that activity such as those against the houthis must also be proportionate and accompany by more diplomatic work across the region to stop wholesale killing the hon gentleman be right to make clear that all of we seek that there should not be an escalation of this conflict in the middle east that be why right at the start britain move military asset to the eastern end of the mediterranean more recently as he allude to we be express strong support for freedom of navigation on the high sea stop attack by the houthis we be degrade their capacity to carry out their attack and have make clear that we will not accept that challenge to international freedom of the sea one problem with the middle east be the sense of hopelessness among the palestinian people which be fuel terrorist outrage what step can the government take with our american friend to try to put pressure on the israeli state to stop the imposition of new settlement in the west bank so that we can gradually reduce tension in the whole region be that not the way forward we have make it clear that the settlement be illegal and should not have go ahead and should not go ahead on the wide point we be work closely with our american friend and other through the superb diplomatic network that britain possess to try to lift people eye and move to the day after when political track can start that be the answer to my right hon friend question the political track which can then start to offer hope in resolve this dreadful and long stand problem call the shadow minister today the middle east be in danger of see major escalation of conflict and whether it be in gaza the red sea lebanon iraq syria or jordan we be see aggression if there be common denominator in those conflict it be the malign influence of iran usually through its proxy what be the government do to disrupt and stop the disruptive activity of iran my right hon friend the foreign secretary have meeting recently with the iranian foreign minister to set out britain view of and requirement from the relationship with iran and think that be most useful contact to have the foreign secretary be in the region today try to ensure that the very point behind this question be accept and honour we be work extensively with jordan egypt qatar israel saudi arabia and america those discussion be ongoing and will address the point that the hon gentleman have raise ukraine what assessment he have make of the impact of the uk non military support to ukraine over winter on the humanitarian situation in that country what recent diplomatic support he have provide to ukraine what discussion he have have with his international counterpart on maintain support for ukraine what recent discussion he have have with his international counterpart on the war in ukraine since february the uk have commit million of humanitarian assistance to ukraine in response to winter we scale up humanitarian support with additional funding to provide cash assistance insulation and support for energy and heating the foreign secretary first overseas visit be to ukraine he continue to set out the uk ambition to international partner and do so in november during nato and osce gathering and most recently at davos where he meet foreign minister kuleba tim bamford our local councillor for denby dale have devote his own time and expense to make several potentially dangerous excursion drive truck to deliver essential humanitarian aid to war tear ukraine alongside volunteer from the yorkshire aid convoy will the minister join in thank tim who be sit in the public gallery and all the fantastic team at the yorkshire aid convoy for everything that they be do to help the ukrainian people and wish they safe journey for their next trip in march be delighted to join my hon friend in thank tim and tina bamford both of whom be in the public gallery the response of the british people to the tragedy in ukraine have be remarkable and hugely generous and we salute the courage and generosity of spirit show by the commendable action of the yorkshire aid convoy there be many billion of russian asset freeze by western nation and there be strong moral case for ukraine to use those asset to repel russia aggression and rebuild its own economy what progress have the department make in talk to other nation to make that reality agree that there be strong moral case for use russian asset to repair the damage that russia have work on ukraine we be clear about the fact that russia should pay and we continue to assess what legal path there might be to achieve that end the united nations high commissioner for refugees recently say think the big difference from last year to this year be that this year there be somehow trend towards get use to ukrainian suffering it be more than day since the opposition table motion necessitating government legislation to bring about the full seizure and repurposing of russian state asset within day but no plan have yet be forthcoming why be the government so out of step with our ally and partner in this regard we be not out of step we be lead the pack and have be do so for the last two year our resolve be show by our own financial commitment but also by our permanent commitment to the uk ukraine relationship which be demonstrate when the prime minister sign the uk ukraine agreement on security co operation at the start of the year we be in it for the long haul tomorrow jens stoltenberg the secretary general of nato will meet representative of the heritage foundation republican lean think tank he will meet ally of former president trump in an effort to unlock billion of funding for ukraine what effort be the government make to persuade trump ally and what contingency planning be they do with our european ally for scenario in which trump and his ally be not persuade minister engage constantly with counterpart around the world include those in the us when it come to the nato response we have see nato expand and grow in the last two year putin think it be weak but it be now big and strong than it be in call the snp spokesperson the international monetary fund estimate that ukraine need billion this year just to manage the book there be special european council meeting on thursday to sign off package of billion in aid to ukraine the uk government have be part of that coalition so can the minister assure we that ukraine fatigue will not set in here there be back across the house for the continuation of these supportive effort and surely the most effective way to get aid to ukraine be to transfer the seized russian asset to finance for ukraine reconstruction assure the hon gentleman that we feel no fatigue when it come to our ukraine policy we have exceed last year commitment in term of lethal aid and we will be contribute huge amount of other aid and economic support since our total humanitarian economic and military support have rise to more than billion which think demonstrate that our resolve be unflagge share the concern of the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord about the attitude towards the ukraine fight and indeed towards nato of certain element on the american political scene will our foreign office team do everything in their power to impress on our american ally that the peace of europe depend on unquestionable american support for the nato alliance in the future just as it do in the past we continue to make that point to all our interlocutor should also say that we continue to make the point to all nato member state that invest of gdp in defence expenditure be condition of membership meet the leeds ukrainian community in my constituency this weekend to hear about the desperate need of war tear ukrainian citizen with the hungarian leader viktor orbán continue to veto the eu billion aid package to ukraine what diplomatic step be the minister take to encourage hungary to play its part in support ukraine fight for freedom we be very active in our diplomacy with hungary and neighbouring state be actually in slovakia last week talk about similar set of issue diplomacy do matter and our judgment be that in the end mr orbán will do the right thing iran and pakistan what recent discussion he have have with his international counterpart on the state of relation between iran and pakistan the foreign secretary have make it clear to his iranian counterpart that iran must stop use regional instability as cover to act recklessly he and lord ahmad have also underline to pakistan foreign minister the importance of avoid further escalation we welcome iran and pakistan subsequent commitment to dialogue in joint statement release on january confirm that ambassador will return to post and we continue to monitor the situation as the minister say diplomatic effort have ease tension follow the exchange of missile early this month however the minister will be aware that over the weekend iranian gunman murder nine pakistanis in the iranian city of saravan the fact that both country have launch air strike against each other indicate how fragile the situation be in the middle east and how interconnect act of war and violence be across the whole region how will the british government ensure that their own action do not escalate tension as say iran must stop use regional instability as cover to carry out its reckless act we recognise that it bear responsibility for any further escalation and we be look at all the tool that we have to bear down on the iranian regime include sanction eritrea human rights what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the human right situation in eritrea we continue to press eritrea bilaterally and at the un human rights council to end human right violation it may come as surprise to the house to hear that eritrea be an elect member of the un human rights council as chair of the all party parliamentary group on eritrea often hear the country describe as the north korea of africa young people be conscript indefinitely and critic of the regime be arbitrarily detain and disappear do the minister agree that that perhaps explain why over of asylum claim from eritreans in the uk be grant by the home office what more can the government do to take step to ensure an end to human right abuse in eritrea and elsewhere in the horn of africa which be push factor behind irregular arrival in the uk think the hon gentleman pull his punch it be bad than he say eritrea rank towards the bottom of the world press freedom index we urge eritrea to allow the un special rapporteur for human right access to the country and we also seek the full withdrawal of eritrean troop from northern ethiopia in accordance with the pretoria peace agreement we must not forget the abuse that be happen in neighbour sudan over million people have be internally displace with million in desperate need of humanitarian aid last night the international criminal court prosecutor tell the un security council that there be reasonable ground to believe that both the sudan armed force and the rapid support force be commit atrocious crime in darfur what hope do the minister have that we can end the impunity stop the rape murder and pillage and bring peace to the people of sudan we be call for an immediate ceasefire there be talk in addis before christmas we seek progress through the united nations where we hold the pen on sudan and also through the troika the intergovernmental authority on development and the african union we be do everything we can to end the appalling situation in sudan which my right hon friend have just describe with great eloquence afghanistan hazara community what discussion he have have with his international counterpart on the situation of the hazara community in afghanistan the uk work closely with the international community include the and and through the un to protect the human right of all of afghanistan people and to co ordinate consistent international response in december my colleague the minister for south asia in the other place raise the recent attack on hazaras with the un assistance mission in afghanistan last week the hon member for bedford mohammad yasin and meet member of our respective hazara community they also regularly attend the all party parliamentary group on hazaras which be chair by the hon member for peterborough paul bristow my concern be that the kidnap rape and persecution that the taliban regularly use against the hazara woman and girl largely go unreported due to lack of diplomacy or to journalist be unable to access the region would the minister or member of her team be prepared to meet those whose family be still strand in the region and be subject to what be essentially the ethnic cleansing of the hazara people the hon lady set out some of the shocking issue that we know about indeed daesh claim responsibility for the november attack and we be continue to see these challenge will happily take back her question to my colleague and be sure that he will be happy to meet they call shadow minister catherine west since the summer of when the hope and dream of so many woman and girl in afghanistan be snuff out we have be struggle to get strategy together for year the uk international partner and afghans themselves fight for more hopeful future for woman and girl will the minister outline what step be be take with international partner to develop sustained strategy for work in the region so that we can regain sense of hope for the million afghans leave behind to future devoid of opportunity the hon lady highlight the frustration that we all feel we be work closely with international partner at number of level to ensure credible monitoring not only of the violence and threat against religious minority but of the challenge for woman and girl across the piece we co sponsor human rights council resolution extend the mandate of the un special rapporteur to monitor and report on the human right situation to try to make decision together on how to tackle it china diplomatic relationship what recent assessment he have make of the strength of the uk diplomatic relationship with china the government set out their approach to china in the integrated review refresh last year we must continue to engage with china to work towards open constructive and stable relation to manage disagreement defend our freedom and co operate where our interest align the foreign secretary speak with china foreign minister wang yi on december in pursuit of those objective the result of economic modelling from the rhodium group the rand corporation and early this month bloomberg on the impact on global gdp of either an economic blockade by china on taiwan or full scale invasion be horrify be right that the government have do their own economic modelling for both those scenario if so will the minister publish it the hon gentleman highlight the importance of understanding and planning for such economic coercion this be an area of policy that sit within my portfolio in the fcdo across government we currently have lot of focus on think about how we can build resilience in uk interest and support partner topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility the government be pursue vital british national interest priority we be support ukraine and the prime minster have announce further package of military support we support

make progress on sudan we be implement the international development white paper which have be well receive around the world continue to deputise for the foreign secretary in this house and regularly seek to keep the house update the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food michael fakhri say at the weekend that more than million people in gaza be face inevitable famine now that the government have opt to halt funding to the un relief and works agency for palestine refugees how do they intend to ensure that the urgently need humanitarian aid as call for in the international court of justice ruling last week and which be central to the ruling will continue to be deliver to the innocent man woman and child in gaza who must have right to food as set out the government high immediate priority be to ensure that aid and humanitarian support get into gaza we be relentlessly pursue that objective have set out where we be on unrwa but there be no immediate effect on the food that it seek to deliver in gaza today understand that my noble friend the foreign secretary will shortly be visit india our friend and key ally in the region will the minister set out what the foreign secretary will be aim to achieve particularly at time when we be negotiate free trade deal and building on the co operation we already have although can not comment in detail on future ministerial plan assure my hon friend that the uk government have broad and deep partnership with the government of india the foreign secretary have ambition to far strengthen that relationship through trade and wide people to people relationship in defence science and technology on november in his first bilateral meeting the foreign secretary discuss some of these issue with external affairs minister jaishankar call the shadow minister access to critical mineral be vital as we face climate and energy crisis but this government have repeatedly disregard latin america and ignore its potential will the minister commit to work with country such as chile brazil peru and mexico to deliver these essential supply for green energy transition both side of the house agree that this be an important issue and can assure the hon lady that we be work very hard have raise the importance of critical mineral on my visit to all those country and not least on my recent visit to bolivia by any measure our world be become more dangerous not less very much welcome britain leadership and rekindle engagement on the international stage not least in ukraine and the middle east do the minister agree that our foreign policy our economy and indeed our security be interdependently relate give the deteriorate threat picture would he like to see an increase in our defence posture my right hon friend the former chairman of the defence committee be absolutely right to focus on these threat the foreign secretary recently say that all the light on the global dashboard be flash red the government know that the first duty of the state be to defend and protect its citizen from external aggression and my right hon friend may rest assure that that will continue to be our high priority tension be soar across the middle east after washington vow to respond to the drone attack by iran back militant that kill three american soldier do the minister share my concern that we may be drag into another regional war at the americans demand the american government and the british government have make it absolutely clear that they do not wish to see this conflict escalate more widely equally the hon gentleman will

have no additional funding plan for this financial year we have already fund unrwa as have other so have no doubt that unrwa support get food to those who desperately need it will continue but we can not ignore the information that be bring to our attention spend yesterday with nato one significant concern express to be the acute need for the us to fulfil its commitment to ukraine in ahead of the washington summit will the minister assure that every effort will be take to leverage political pressure on our ally and to secure the necessary support for which we be very grateful on the road to washington we continue to make that point the us will continue to be an integral part of european security as will other european member state of nato which should ensure that they commit to their

with people come over the border the situation in sudan that the hon lady describe be absolutely appalling with nearly million people urgently need food if she wish to discuss her specific case with

improvement in relation with france and its president that have take place under our right hon friend the prime minister he and be celebrate year of the entente cordiale at the french residence last

particularly in the white paper that this matter remain top priority the white paper announce million of additional spending to support woman right organisation as we know woman right be under threat all around the world and we be do everything we can to support girl and woman as new heartbreaking testimony of hamas use of sexual violence and rape come to light from survivor of the october attack what assessment have my right hon friend make of the silence of many international organisation such as the international red cross on that appalling issue hope that my hon friend will draw strength and satisfaction from the fact that the british government be not silent on that very important matter be sure that the minister be as shocked as be by venezuela action towards guyana last year will he update the house and have guyanese heritage on what step the government be take to uphold guyana sovereignty thank the hon member for that question on an important subject close to the heart of several people in the chamber assure she that there be ongoing engagement with of course president ali in guyana but also all the regional player have personally have conversation with brazil colombia the commonwealth and the united states to keep the focus on that area and maduro plan at bay what assessment have the government make of the threat to the future of the baltic state if putin be see to

misery of woman and girl in the occupy territory be increasingly concerned that aid be not get to they the united nations say that there be chronic aid access problem and that woman be have caesarean section without anaesthetic what be go on be the aid not get to they what step be the department take to ensure that it do tackle this be britain central aim the aim be to get humanitarian aid into gaza but also to ensure that there be plan on the west bank to take forward political initiative everything that we be do be bent on try to get the aid that be in the region through the narrow entrance into gaza we will continue to do that the minister have say several time in the last few day that the government decision to suspend funding for unrwa should not affect that agency ability to deliver immediate aid in the region if it transpire in the day and week ahead that the opposite be the case and the agency be be compromise will the government immediately review their decision yesterday speak to the head of unrwa philippe lazzarini make the point that it be essential that his review which of course he be not conduct the un be conduct it be complete as fast as possible for the reason the hon gentleman set out be reasonably confident that it can be conduct within the next two month and the british government be watch this carefully will the minister confirm whether the government have undertake any further military action in yemen since january if so will he clarify whether the government long term plan include commit to sustained military action in one of the poor country of the world we be careful to ensure that our response to the houthis in yemen be proportionate and right we be conscious of the importance of get food into yemen to feed people who be starve that process be hinder by the grossly irresponsible act of the houthi terrorist yasin malik political leader of the jammu kashmir liberation front be give life sentence in the indian authority appeal that sentence last year seek the death penalty and the judgment be due on february give the uk long stand opposition to the death penalty what discussion have the minister have with the indian authority about this important case we always continue to make it clear that we disagree with the death penalty my colleague the minister for south asia raise this issue most recently on january and we continue to highlight it know that he would be happy to discuss the case with the hon lady if she wish the foreign office record over death of uk national in thailand in some of which be of undetermined cause in and the year before then no murder be record of uk national in thailand my constituent son be murder in thailand in do the minister still maintain that uk national do not get murder in thailand we work closely with thailand and our official in the country lead by our ambassador do great deal of work around these difficult issue when they arise have pick up some of the consular case myself if there be specific issue that the hon gentleman wish to raise be happy to meet he to discuss they have and year old constituent british citizen who be stick in the israeli fire zone in southern lebanon the foreign office be urge they to return to the uk but as their mother be not british citizen the home office be prevent that will the minister help to persuade the home office to relent on this issue be happy to look at the case that the hon gentleman raise immediately after question time if that be convenient to he the foreign secretary be in the region today not far away from the country that the hon gentleman mention and be sure that we will be able to advance the talk that be go on telegraph media group propose sale to redbird imi urgent question to ask the secretary of state for culture media and sport if she will make statement on the propose sale of the telegraph media group to redbird imi be grateful to my hon friend for table the urgent question for the second time in as many day this be media focus day for as will take the media bill through its remain stage straight after the urgent question so forgive if one have make insufficiently prepared for the other or vice versa be in the frustrating circumstance that can say only what be publicly know and nothing of the specific in answer to question about the ownership of the telegraph media group which contain two of the world great newspaper the sunday telegraph and the daily telegraph and in the spectator the old survive weekly magazine in the world as hon member will be aware my right hon and learn friend the secretary of state for culture media and sport have issue public interest intervention notice in respect of the anticipated acquisition of the group by rb investco ltd far to the notice issue in november in respect of the redbird imi medium joint venture which remain in force she be lead this process and examine it in great detail and with great care but it be quasi judicial process involve the competition and markets authority which look at jurisdictional and competition matter and ofcom which will be report to she on public interest consideration in relation to the medium expressly accurate presentation of the news and free expression of opinion both report will be return on march my right hon and learn friend as very assiduous and diligent kc be make sure that as media minister be absolutely exclude from the process because that be what it demand be not permit to know about the scrutiny that be under way or to interfere with it she be also not permit to take into account any political or presentational concern in her deliberation and we would not wish to cause there to be any chink of light here that would leave the process open to judicial review that leave in an unenviable position face understandable expert probe by hon member to whom can offer no answer beyond what be in the public domain however this urgent question be as much an opportunity for hon member to make their concern clear and their view know as it be an opportunity for to answer they so say be hear loud and clear straight after this urgent question will take the media bill through its remain stage and make the case for that legislation in broad term will argue that free medium not interfere with by government or indeed government able to articulate and reflect broad range of view free to speak and create and able to project to the world what democracy plurality of view and debate truly mean be something important that we should value in many respect it underpin what we mean by free society of course we all know that it be something that we repeat automaton like in way that risk give rise to complacency however as watch the action of authoritarian state in these time of turbulence as see western democracy in knot of angst over our value and as see our population question from the safety of these shore whether our value still matter be remind of the need to make that case again and again can not speak to the specific media ownership question know hon member will understand that and will help keep within the tramline but can speak about medium freedom the need for medium to be separate from political and government interference the importance of british voice domestically and internationally and the pride we can feel in medium institution such as those in the telegraph media group some of which date back two century and drive change in this nation as profound as the great reform act to this day those who write for those institution ask question of we all with rare inquisitiveness and preoccupation with truth interruption shall finish shortly will be hear order please do not tell what you be go to do be in charge of the time you be way over and expect you now to finish quickly apologise mr speaker for over speaking will listen to the point make in the broad of term and suspect that may agree with many of they thank you for grant this important urgent question mr speaker the minister hit the nail on the head when she say that this be about freedom from government interference although it be quite something for we to start this urgent question know that we will get no answer to any of our question we have proud tradition of fiercely independent press in our country press who hold we to account in this place and shine light on misbehaviour and misdoing here and abroad yet paper of record the daily telegraph and the spectator the long run magazine in the world and my personal podcast of choice will be purchase by foreign state the concern here be about not foreign ownership but foreign state ownership in this situation we can not separate sheikh and state those be our concern more broadly worry that we have allow our medium critical national infrastructure for our democracy to fall between the crack our defend democracy taskforce look only at electoral concern and the national security and investment act deal with sector none of which be the medium we therefore have no protection against this sort of situation have four question that hope the minister will at least attempt to answer appreciate the restriction that be in place first be there any example from around the world of nation with differ medium value to put it politely acquire the newspaper of another country secondly will the government commit to national security investigation of these purchase thirdly do the government not recognise that their intervention in the united arab emirates purchase of vodafone set precedent allow they to intervene in this case finally will they look either to extend the defend democracy taskforce or those sector to ensure that we can protect our medium we be deal with something that will make we vulnerable not for five or year but for the rest of our life and we can not afford for our medium to be undermine thank my hon friend for her question as she be aware public interest intervention notice have be issue in this case which mean that be not able to speak to number of the point that will likely be raise however power under the enterprise act allow we to look into acquisition of this nature and to examine issue of medium freedom of expression we also have power under the national security act the cabinet office have role there that will allow the culture secretary to look at some of the question that my hon friend raise there will now be an investigation by not only the competition and markets authority but ofcom which will look into all these question in great detail that will allow the secretary of state to make judgment on what action she take next there may potentially be long investigation after which she could be offer particular remedy or could prevent transaction however at this stage can not speculate on what action she be likely to take call the shadow secretary of state be frustrate with the minister want to thank she for her answer but frankly it be not an answer the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns the chair of the select committee on foreign affairs ask perfectly reasonable question which do not go into the specific and zoom out to the general yet we still have no answer strong and independent free press be cornerstone of democracy we have long history of that in the uk the spectator be the old magazine in the world it be the responsibility of government regardless of their political persuasion or the newspaper under discussion to safeguard the freedom to scrutinise to expose wrongdoing and to speak truth to power we on these benches recognise the legitimate public interest concern raise over the propose acquisition of the telegraph media group include about the accurate presentation of news free expression of opinion in newspaper and the competition issue welcome the fact that the government have ask further question and await the conclusion of the investigation by the competition and markets authority and ofcom in full but the telegraph have be up for sale for month the secretary of state issue her first public interest intervention notice on november this process be ongoing employee at the telegraph and the spectator have be leave in limbo and senior journalist have express significant concern can the minister tell the house why the secretary of state have grant an extension to the deadline by which she expect to receive report from ofcom and the cma in relation to the piin be sure she can not but be just go to ask anyway can the minister tell the house this be general one so maybe she can whether in the light of the propose sale she have any plan to review the exist rule on media ownership have she or the secretary of state consider that or have any conversation with colleague about it with general election approach in significant year for democracy across the world and with record number of people go to the poll the freedom of the press have never be more important now be not the time for the government to have no answer or to be asleep at the wheel thank the hon lady for her rather hyperbolic intervention we be have debate because two public interest intervention notice have be issue the government take their power in this respect seriously and the competition and markets authority and ofcom will be give the space and time to look into all these issue in detail those notice be issue because the secretary of state take the issue of medium freedom and the ownership of important british medium institution extremely seriously therefore ask the hon lady to help we those investigation be under way we must not prejudice they and must ensure they be watertight the important question of media ownership be something that all member of this house care about it would be regrettable if be to say anything in this chamber that should prejudice that process so say again to the hon lady that action have be take it be something the government take seriously and ask she to let the process take its course it be hugely new for we to be tell that we will not get our question answer at the dispatch box we be use to that happen anyway but it be good to be tell that it be waste of our time be here in the first place to press on with not be answer say to the minister that and other across all party write letter to her department specify that we be all oppose to this potential takeover we make it clear that we be not opposed to it because we dislike that particular government although have to say that that may well be feature rather we would oppose it if the french government wish to buy the newspaper or even if this government decide they would control they we would oppose that on the basis that it would trample right across the idea of freedom of the press follow the notice that have go to the cma simply ask the minister whether she would ask the secretary of state to create new piin on the basis that redbird imi have twice disrupt the government effort to properly scrutinise the purchase particularly with the idea of debt be load into the purchase we need far detailed investigation would be grateful if the minister do that because this could easily turn into disaster for this government do not say would give no answer say would be able to give general answer and my right hon friend will understand why these be very precise process that must be keep watertight and would not want to do anything to prejudice they or the secretary of state ability to act in way that be in the interest of this country and the medium this be not waste of time it be an opportunity for this house to make its voice and opinion know on what be controversial issue of great public interest an issue that we as government be very interested in my right hon friend also make the important point that his concern be not about the government in this particular case but about government ownership in principle it be something appreciate and understand and be sure it will be in the secretary of state mind when host sultan al jaber say that there be no science behind the climate change emergency the sultan be head of the uae medium council and influential in the telegraph takeover work for many year as journalist understand that democracy require plurality in the medium landscape sadly in the uk the vast majority of title be already skewed to the right in scotland as we know half the population support independence but only one title support that position we do not want the situation worsen be in favour of free diverse and vibrant press ecosystem and not in favour of newspaper be own as loss make public relation arm of foreign state through access to our daily news cycle do the minister agree that allow the uae to take over the telegraph would be unhealthy in principle for our democracy thank the hon gentleman for raise an issue of principle which perfectly understand as something that speak about in relation to the bbc and how it must have editorial independence from the government as principle would be concern about government ownership of any medium institution but as he will be aware can speak only of principle when the wonderful taylor swift discover that her back catalogue have be buy by purchaser of whom she disapprove she begin to render it worthless by re record all her previous hit be that an example that journalist at the spectator and the telegraph might do well to follow thank my right hon friend for his mischievous suggestion could not possibly comment on it but be sure that it have be hear be reel from the comparison of telegraph hack with taylor swift if the minister can not answer question maybe we could use this as an exercise in issue some concern the national union of journalists concern be obviously about job but they be also about future editorial independence it behove the minister and the government to look at what sanction could be use in future if agreement be reach but not keep to murdoch be the good example of that in addition wonder whether it be time as my hon friend the member for bristol west thangam debbonaire say for proper review of medium ownership thank the right hon gentleman for speak on behalf of the nuj and for raise what this mean for medium plurality and the ability of journalist to hold we here to account agree on those generality but be afraid can not say anything more about the specific of this case as he will be aware once the process be over be sure there will be question to go back to about how we well look into how our medium be own for what it be worth the proposal be say to enhance the competitive landscape not diminish it do the minister agree that this sort of decision must be make accord to legal principle not politic it be not appropriate to consider political posturing from the left or right when decide this important matter which be part of the secretary of state quasi judicial function my right hon and learn friend be right to say that the secretary of state will be under specific obligation to consider this matter without politic both the cma and ofcom will look at this carefully from regulatory point of view we as politician should also have right to some broad view about media ownership as we consider those question the secretary of state be the departmental owner of culture medium and sport and will have some consideration about how to ensure dynamic medium landscape be sure that she will carefully apply her legal brain to the application of those principle think the house see for what be which be shy and retire member for year have be tease in the telegraph at the hand of mr alan cochrane and more recently in the spectator but that be democracy it be the nature of the beast and it be free speech agree with the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns that there be national security implication think that the mood of the house be that this be simply not on we all agree on that the message should be pass back to the secretary of state and to the government that we will not wear this hope the hon gentleman do not mind say so but believe that when last see he he be on his way to spectator burns night party so hope the relationship be warm and cordial now with no unkindness towards he from that magazine as say at the outset this be useful exercise in make the view of this house know on this matter it be an important opportunity for member to have their say and hope that they will be hear must say be amuse by the minister opening remark because can not recall any judicial review ever be trigger by statement in parliament not once however give that she want statement not question in the event that the cma and ofcom report find conditionally in favour in any way she must not take the murdoch ownership of the times as an example because since the sacking of its editor that have be failure not success as my right hon friend will be aware the decision make process be not mine will not be the person to make judgment call on this matter the cma and ofcom have until march to issue their initial report at that stage undertaking can be accept or second stage can be open be sure that all these question will be in the secretary of state mind as she make that judgment thank the minister very much for her answer which be always very helpful and we appreciate that can she outline if measure can and will be put in place to secure editorial freedom in the long term we look to nation with completely different ideal but which have capacity to shape the medium narrative and public information how can we make sure that we retain trust as the hon gentleman will be aware public notice have be issue on this matter ofcom will look expressly at accurate presentation of the news and free expression of opinion when it make its report and judgment know hope that will give he some assurance about how the medium consideration will be look at not just the competition aspect fully understand the limitation on what my hon friend can say have cover for she until few week ago as medium minister be give no inside information about this matter either however she will be aware that it be now over five year since the ofcom report to the secretary of state that say that the internet have transform the way that news be provide and consume and that there will need to be fundamental review of the medium ownership regime do she agree with that and can she say whether the government will undertake that review thank my right hon friend for his expert cover for we discuss that subject in our handover when he tell that there be no information that he could share because he be assiduous in his role and make sure that he be not involve in area that he should not be he ask about future ownership question he will be aware that we be debate the medium bill after this urgent question we have look at some issue in relation to medium in particular the change medium landscape and how the internet have change it that have not cover all the issue that will be raise by this acquisition but be sure that once that the media bill have complete all its stage we will be able to look afresh at the other hole in the landscape appreciate that there be limit to what the minister can say about the potential sale of the daily telegraph to owner back by the uae but be there any lesson for medium freedom that the government might learn from the creation of university branch campus in the uae and what that have mean for freedom of speech be afraid that be not subject about which know great deal shall happily look into it and see whether there be any implication for our medium landscape but can not comment in relation to this specific acquisition do the minister agree that the fact that we be in this position show that clarity be need about media ownership rule we need presumption against sovereign foreign state acquire strategic uk medium asset to further their influence just as there should one be against acquisition by foreign oligarch who might not have commitment to the medium we need some certainty about how and where such an intervention can be make and not purely on competition ground that point have be raise by number of hon member we have tool for these kind of acquisition as can be see in the public interest intervention notice that we have impose in this case reassure member that we be not totally naked on this question there be tool under the enterprise act that allow we to look into it be sure that once the process be over we will be able to look back and say whether any further action or intervention be require as owner expect to have influence over editor and the editorial line why do we not have policy of rule out all government ownership of such organisation which would make it much simple thank my right hon friend for make that simple point it be one that be sure will be consider once this case have pass be media outlet in an authoritarian state or indeed any other state to be threaten with foreign ownership would the minister responsible be as scrupulous in her answer as my hon friend have so properly be with we today perhaps not be sure that many member be like concern about foreign ownership of our institution and business our national resilience strategic independence and critical infrastructure as well as our medium be vital to quote the well know album how do we ensure that we do not end up sell england by the pound as have say in answer to similar question we have power to look into some of those investment and ownership question and they do not relate just to the medium we now have much broad national security and investment power in relation to question such as these and to other area in which there be critical national interest in the ownership of particular asset it would be wrong for member to leave the chamber with the belief that there be no such power and that all these acquisition can go ahead regardless of security and other implication the minister be absolutely right ofcom can apply test which it already apply to broadcast licence do she agree that give the change in the medium landscape that should be roll over to news website and publisher that have significant scale we be look at how we regulate online content alongside standard broadcasting and other medium output one outcome of the mid term review be that some of the bbc online material will be consider in the same way as its other output those be all question that the department be look into to ensure that medium regulation and legislation be fit for what be rapidly change medium landscape it be clear that pay off the debt mean that redbird imi have control over the title indeed it have already transfer the ownership of that debt to new uk entity should not the secretary of state also issue piin on the debt to ensure that she retain control of the situation my hon friend will be aware that this be the second such notice to have be issue be not able to speculate on or speak about any other action that the secretary of state might be minded to take know that he will understand that he will know that the broad principle of concern to he about which he have write so eloquently and powerfully in recent week and month be also close to my heart autism early identification motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about the training of teacher in relation to the early identification of autism and for connected purpose for those with autism the stat be stark few than half of autistic child say that they be happy in school of young autistic people say that their teacher do not understand their need only achieve grade or above in english and math gcse compare with for all pupil and on top of that autistic child be twice as likely to be exclude from school than their peer it do not get well in adulthood just of autistic people be in full or part time employment and those in work be pay third less than their peer that be not right especially when the potential of autistic child with proper support should not be underestimate autistic people have strong attention to detail creative talent mathematical and technical ability and expertise in niche area those of we who know autistic child know that they be honest and loyal we all know that an early diagnosis help to identify what an individual child need and what adjustment need to be put in place so that their strength can be maximise it provide positive pathway instead of negative one it mean that those with autism be more likely to find work it help to combat mental health issue which affect of those with special educational need and disability and cost the uk economy million however of child wait long than the nhs week deadline and wait more than month that backlog mean that quarter of child with autism will not be diagnose while in school in norfolk between and october be diagnose with autism many wait long than month for their diagnosis some even wait three year and one wait year how many more of the child in norfolk will not be assess at all the question be why do diagnosis not happen until much later unfortunately there be often wait and see attitude however not only be delay in diagnosis extremely damaging for child who be autistic but it be unnecessary condition such as autism have marker from six month old as it become obvious through the way child learn move or pay attention exist weakness in the send system which be magnify by the pandemic also make it difficult for people with autism to get diagnosis there be inconsistency in how send be identify lack of join up thinking on care and lack of clarity regard accountability and responsibility in organisation that lead to delay in an already weak system make the fight that many parent undertake to have their child assess even hard over year ago in this chamber mention hayley turner constituent who come to as she be have difficulty get the right support for her son rocky be ask about early year psychologist in education question but it be partly through conversation with hayley that the inspiration for this bill take flight so would briefly like to share her story rocky be two year old when his parent notice that he be develop little differently it be when he start school age four that it become clear that mainstream education be not the right fit and that those teach he be not train to teach child with neurodiverse condition that situation be very distressing for he and for hayley who have to fight to be hear she go to tribunal and spend many hour put together all the necessary paperwork to show that rocky need to be place in specialist education it be an unnecessary distraction that take hayley away from be the mum she need to be for both her child which make everyday family life hard rocky be just one of thousand of child whose parent be fight today for their child to have an adequate education indeed the government own send statistic show that of parent win on appeal once they get to tribunal those child be not difficult or troublesome hayley say something very poignant autistic child whilst in mainstream school be easily misunderstood they be just innocent child try to survive in an environment that be design for they they have to fail first before they be adequately support and that not how child should start their education rocky story be eventually success story but it be his story along with other conversation have have that lead to introduce the bill today it be important to impress on all member of the house that autistic child will not grow out of it they will need extra help and target treatment to reduce the chance of negative consequence and financial burden in later life however as it stand just of primary school teacher have more than half day training in autism such small number for secondary school that figure drop to just send be see as specialist area bolt on not build in with teacher training not include how to ensure that teacher can identify send marker that need to change autistic pupil routinely identify autism training for teacher as the single big change that would improve their experience of school that can only happen if all teacher be train in send it be for those reason that introduce my ten minute rule bill the autism early identification bill which will deliver support to increase autism assessment reduce diagnosis waiting time and introduce mandatory autism training for all teacher the bill will provide solid base through which all teacher will learn about early identification the special educational need code of practice the pattern and sequence of child development what need to be do if child have communication difficulty and understanding and deal with difficult behaviour it will mean that if milestone be not meet help can be put in place that few child will struggle in school and that they will no long be label difficult or disruptive through bill that ensure that all teaching staff can support autistic pupil well school will in turn become more inclusive place where everyone staff pupil and parent be truly value and feel sense of belong be encourage by the openness of this government to change in the system it be positive that the government announce as far back as the last queen speech that every child will get the education they deserve and that there be vision ethos and strategic direction in our education system be also encourage by the publication of the send and alternative provision improvement plan in which the government state that they will explore opportunity to build teacher expertise through review of the initial teacher training itt core content framework and early career framework be encourage by the secretary of state comment at the dispatch box yesterday and by letter from the minister last july that say that all initial teacher training course must be design so that trainee teacher can demonstrate clear understanding of the need of all pupil include those with send and

they will speak to amendment which relate to the repeal of section of the crime and courts act with the will of the house will press the amendment to division later today but first will briefly address some of the other amendment amendment be not actually link to the debate about section or indeed the leveson inquiry it be about something very different it simply state that ofcom when consider and assess the public service remit should also have regard to the framework convention on national minority that be because the current framework acknowledge the importance of language in this country and their recognition under the framework convention on minority language but it omit the framework convention on national minority that be of particular importance to place such as cornwall scotland and wales where the culture and identity go beyond just language hope the government will consider address this matter in the other place as the bill progress new clause address the simple reality that although the government have say that they intend to repeal section of the crime and courts act ministers have confirm to that the government remain committed to the continued existence of the royal charter on self regulation of the press that royal charter be establish by david cameron when he be prime minister in response to the recommendation of the leveson inquiry conservative members vote to put in place section in order to create an incentive to join the royal charter give that the government have say that they want to repeal section which create that incentive but that they remain absolutely committed to keep the royal charter surely they should at the very least have call for evidence to examine what other possible incentive might encourage publisher to join that royal charter if the government do not believe in the royal charter on self regulation of the press they would simply bring forward orders in council to disband the royal charter as be provide for under article of the charter the government do not want to do that so if they remain committed to the royal charter let we at least explore those option they could include give publisher access to arbitration so that they can get fair share of the advertising revenue for the news content they produce that remain an open problem some government legislation seek to address it but it could go far wish to focus principally on amendment since that be the one intend to press to division the amendment would simply put in place more precise cut to deliver the government objective section of the crime and courts act have two part the first part subsection an incentive for publisher to join because it give they protection against those with deep pocket there be carrot and stick in section the carrot be that if for the sake of argument russian oligarch threaten publisher and say we go to get carter ruck to write expensive letter to you we will see you in court if you publish this that publisher would have have protection because they would have be able to say to the rich and powerful we have confidence in our story and be go to run it and if you do like the story we will see you in arbitration we will see you in court if you insist on take we to court and bypass that arbitration you will pay the publisher cost as well as your own that be the carrot the bit that the press never object to no one ever raise an objection to that but there be also stick subsection of section the stick basically say that publisher who do not join recognise regulator have more cost exposure to ordinary citizen who have have their life and privacy violate and have no redress other than to bring legal action the press never object to the carrot they only ever object to the stick because they be glass half empty type of industry they of course tend to focus on the bit they do not like rather than the bit they do like and they lobby furiously to have that part of section remove then we come to the conservative manifesto let we be honest it be not the good manifesto the party have ever draft probably due to drafting error that manifesto pledge not just to remove subsection of subsection which be all that be require and which would have deliver the spirit of that manifesto commitment but commit to remove the entirety of section which be completely unnecessary amendment would remove the stick but retain the carrot it would remove subsection of section in that it would deliver everything the press have ever want and therefore also satisfy the government intention this be point that have often make the hon gentleman carrot as he call it seem very similar to anti slapp legislation which have be welcome generally on both side of the house and can not see why anyone who support slapp legislation would not also support amendment certainly will support it and hope that it get support across the house the hon gentleman be absolutely right anyone who truly believe in free press as he and do would want to ensure that we can protect genuine investigative journalism and that the rich and powerful would not be able to intimidate and bully publisher with limited financial resource many of they lose money into not run story that be essentially true be amendment to be agree to those publisher that choose not to sign up to recognise regulator would have nothing to lose they would be no bad off than they be today fraser nelson editor of the spectator have have very strong position that he would never join recognise regulator it would be open to he not to he would be no well and no worse off than he be today as if something end up in litigation he would not be pay both side cost publication such as private eye which famously have never join anything would also be free to stand aloof from any kind of regulator and it would be no well or bad off than it be today publication such as the daily mail which have wealthy benefactor stand behind they people with deep pocket who be willing to pay for litigation and backfill the lose that such company make would be no well or bad off than they be today in that they could decide not to join regulator however those small plucky publisher that do not have wealthy benefactor stand behind they and that seek to do genuine investigative journalism that might attract the attention of those threaten legal action would have the option of join recognise regulator so that they could get protection against that type of strategic litigation bring by the rich and powerful people with deep pocket against they so say to the minister that can deliver everything that the government seek in way that be fitting with the spirit of the conservative manifesto but that keep open the option of small publisher be able to gain some protection let remind the house why we end up with section in the first place there be public outcry about what be call the phone hack scandal the widespread recognition that culture have develop that enable publisher to hack into people phone it be david cameron the conservative prime minister who establish the leveson inquiry it be david cameron who choose lord justice leveson to chair it because lord justice leveson be know as somebody who be not hostile to the press lord justice leveson invest huge amount of his time in come up with very sensible set of proposal it be david cameron who then say we would implement those proposal with cross party support from all party in this house and it be the conservative whips office that actually whip the conservative side of the house to implement section as david cameron wish to happen let we remember that in that leveson inquiry dozen of victim of phone hacking come forward to give evidence and they do so because the prime minister have set up an inquiry and they feel that it be sincere and genuine and that they could contribute we all have have constituency case in which people have be through extraordinary tragedy and it be painful for they but often people who have be through such tragedy want to know that something good have come from it many of those witness who give evidence to the leveson inquiry be the parent of child who have be murder who have have their life rifle through by the medium and they want something good to come out of that so they go through the trauma and the painful experience of share those experience to try to help parliament wrestle its way to sensible compromise so let we have no nonsense from the government front bench try to create some sort of wedge issue this be provision that the conservative government put in place and the royal charter on self regulation be very conservative approach to deal with the challenge my right hon friend will forgive if have get hold of the wrong end of the stick he be make strong case for his amendment but have one nagging doubt in my mind understand that he believe that if his amendment be agree to and we remove the stick newspaper will be protect from the rich and powerful but what protection would remain for those who be not of mean those who do not have the money that they can risk in litigation to take on those publisher who may have defame or libel they but who be not member of regulatory body this be not just about the rich and powerful there could be people who do not have any money who be affect by newspaper and be not clear how in his new landscape they would be affect my right hon friend make powerful point but be seek to reach compromise his argument be for keep section in its entirety so that those who do not have financial mean and who face publisher who refuse to act within any kind of reputable regulator would have some redress in the court of course in section there be only weighted presumption in favour of particular approach to cost it be never hard and fast rule my right hon friend make strong case but be seek to form compromise with the house and with those on the government front bench and if it be their intention to do what the press want they can accept my amendment and still look the press in the eye and say we give you everything you want which be the removal of the stick maybe they hope they will get some positive coverage as result of do this favour suspect they will end up be disappoint by that between now and the general election nevertheless be try to make compromise with they hope that the government will look seriously at this will my right hon friend help the house by say whether he have have any communication with the guardian or private eye on this proposal have multiple conversation with lot of publisher when the original leveson architecture be put together particularly around the royal charter know that private eye have always object to join anything at all and it would be completely unaffected by the proposal it be not member of the independent press standards organisation and it be never member of the press complaints commission it have always remain entirely aloof and there be nothing in the proposal that affect its position nor would anything in the proposal affect say the spectator which also have view that it would not join recognise regulator as say small publisher that want to do genuine investigative journalism and that do not have people with deep pocket stand behind they could benefit from the proposal by sign up to recognise regulator many of they be already member of impress which be the recognise regulator at the moment but other may form different regulator or encourage ipso to join and seek recognition so that they can benefit from that cost protection intend to press amendment to division later hope the government will recognise that they can accommodate the provision and that it can be consistent with their manifesto commitment hope that we will not hear any nonsense from the front bench about freedom of the press because what be suggest would strengthen the freedom of the press rather than weaken it would like to run through number of the amendment in my name which have largely be promote by the national union of journalists will also say that new clause appear to be part of the unfinished business of leveson which we need to move on fairly swiftly to ensure that people have proper redress and protection while maintain the freedom of the press want to cover number of issue in my amendment such as the protection of public service broadcasting diversity within the sector medium literacy and the demand for consultation on medium change new clause would add detailed description of the range of genre that ofcom must report whether the public service broadcaster have make available it would also give ofcom the responsibility to measure the extent of public service broadcasting across specific genre and the ability to set quota if it feel that specific genre be not cover adequately it come from campaign by the voice of the listener viewer to protect the requirement in the psb remit to broadcast programme within specific genre section of the communications act set out in some detail the requirement on public service broadcasting across whole range of different genre include cultural activity the extent that be appropriate for facilitate civic understanding and fair and well inform debate on news and current affair religion and so on will not go through the full list it be very detailed the problem be that the bill as it stand update that position but with generalised list of what will be take into account and protect in term of the genre of audio visual content there be general concern that that could lead to number of specific area such as science or religion become vulnerable there will still be variety of genre that there be no specific requirement on public service broadcaster to broadcast the select committee carry out pre legislative scrutiny of the bill raise the matter in its discussion it feel that the government replace the list of specific commitment require of public service broadcaster with general remit be step too far the government response be that their amendment be simply simplification even the chair of the select committee say the simplification of the remit and enforcement of it for ofcom would come at considerable cost number of piece of evidence submit to the committee draw attention to area where the requirement on public service broadcaster could be significantly weaken even to the point of the overall removal of content will quote the example give by anna mcnamee the executive director of the sandford st martin trust about what be happen with regard to the coverage of religion she say in itv successfully lobby ofcom for its psb quota for art and religious content to be remove and unfortunately in ofcom notice that itv provision of religion and ethic have all but cease the lesson from that draw to the committee and the minister attention be that there be no quota no obligation to do so and that under compete pressure individual genre and section of broadcasting would be delete overall what we feel be need in the legislation be statutory requirement that where there be an identification of societal value of particular genre ofcom would be able to track the psb performance and ensure that the distinctive content be available to audience that be reflection of ofcom own concern so far it have notice decline in the provision of those genre broadcasting legislation until this bill have set out what be consider societally valuable content and define the remit of ofcom and psb in that way unfortunately this generalise statement within the bill fail to enable that to happen in the future my new clause would provide ofcom with strong power with clear remit of what should be protect and the ability to set quota if it consider current level in certain genre to be unsatisfactory it should allow the regulator to stem the significant decline of those genre since my new clause would place duty on public service broadcaster to publish their objective on the promotion of diversity and equality among the workforce and on ofcom to monitor and report on the public service broadcaster performance on meet that requirement that come out of an analysis of what be happen with regard to the diversity of the workforce in broadcasting if public service broadcasting be to represent all sector of the uk population the workforce should be truly representative that be general view that have be express across the house ofcom have recognise that broadcaster with advanced data collection practice tend to have more representative workforce the new clause would far empower ofcom to specify what kind of datum company should be require to monitor and publish therefore ensure that they be look at the impact of their diversity policy some of the figure on the lack of diversity in broadcasting be quite startling if we take class as an example people from working class background be under represent in the broadcasting sector some of employee who provide datum be from working class background below the uk population figure of in term of gender diversity man remain dominant in most senior role in particular the important role of writer with the number of woman in senior role have actually drop in recent year from to that have be decline continuously over the past four year the figure for ethnicity be also pretty stark in term of the lack of representation again we be find that without adequate monitoring there have be lack of any form of influence to improve the situation the creative diversity network run project call diamond to monitor diversity but number of the union do not participate because the broadcaster have fail to share their statistic nevertheless there be significant contribution make by individual work offscreen and onscreen reflect people concern about the lack of diversity in term of gender ethnicity and disability there be stark figure that demonstrate the lack of representation in public service broadcasting this new clause be simply intend to ensure that adequate statistic be provide and datum collect and that ofcom monitoring and intervention power be strengthen once meet young lady who be keen to work in television and she tell that she want to be presenter however because she wear hijab she be sure that she would never get to be presenter she have never see any presenter wear hijab do the right hon gentleman feel as do that transparency in report those figure would help make clear to everybody what diversity be lack the reason for this new clause be not push it to vote or anything be to encourage the debate far because we seem to have hit brick wall or glass ceiling whichever hon member prefer part of the reason those attitude persist be the lack of ethnic minority particularly in senior position the figure for black asian or minority ethnic community member in all senior role be just an under representation compare with the population for senior producer it be and for head of production it be south asian representation offscreen at all level have actually fall to less than half of the figure in the population as whole which be around the reason for this new clause be to stimulate debate because in addition to the failure of the exist system to maintain level we be go backwards in some area not only be the number of people with disability in senior role at low level but it have not change in four year there need to be great intervention and more power to monitor and to require the delivery of statistic and there need to be proper participation by public service broadcaster in that ofcom also need the ability to intervene more effectively just quickly because other hon member want to speak will say that new clause be intend to place on public service broadcaster duty to report on media literacy it would introduce requirement for public service broadcaster to take appropriate step to improve level of medium literacy among their audience and allow ofcom to monitor that to see how the public broadcaster be pursue that medium literacy requirement the reason for this new clause be that thing have move on since the communications act remember that debate at that point be around teletext the huge expansion of social medium have not be anticipate still less the arrival of artificial intelligence do not think need to stress in this house the importance of counter misinformation disinformation fake news conspiracy theory and the like across social medium or the need to raise the issue of medium literacy more widely public service broadcaster have an even great role and duty now not only to provide impartial and accurate information but to increase media literacy and make great effort to reach all age group in the uk particularly young people the bbc marianna spring as people will know be charge with cover some of these issue for the bbc and number of other broadcaster try independently to check the veracity of factual claim or to make an assessment of the credibility of source particularly in area where there be conflict around the world however there be need now to be more explicit about the issue that people face in the interpretation of medium for that reason it be time for duty to be place upon public service broadcaster to develop media literacy strategy which will enable the receiver of their broadcast to well understand and well cut through some of the misinformation that be be purvey there have be debate in this house already about the need for great recognition within the medium itself of the threat pose by artificial intelligence we have already see the danger of artificially generate news story and image with report of inaccurate datum be use to inform artificial intelligence generate story false attribution to journalist and creator and people discover that their likeness have be use without their knowledge or consent that be why the nuj be try to encourage the debate about who be responsible for raise the level medium literacy new clause would simply put statutory duty upon public service broadcaster to develop and publish strategy for what they be do to raise media literacy and give ofcom role in monitor that new clause be requirement for public service broadcaster to report on their consultation with the public viewer and listener number of member of the house be involve in the discussion with the bbc about local radio service and the cutback that be take place with no consultation with the recipient of the local radio service the listener themselves we see the same with regard to the bbc news channel and bbc world service cutback we find that there be group who be not consult or engage whatsoever as result we believe that poor decision be make it be within the bbc governance framework and the royal charter to highlight public service broadcaster obligation to regularly consult the general public and key demographic of viewer and listener when make key decision about programming and service to local community that seem to have fall down dramatically in recent year it be also important that other public service broadcaster be place under that obligation new clause put public service broadcaster under an obligation to develop and publish strategy for maintain regular consultation and give ofcom duty to report on whether that be be undertake appropriately although the new clause do not deal with this we urge the government to ensure that there be recognition in the negotiation on the licence fee next time around that there be proper process for the bbc to consult rather than try to negotiate secret deal with the government my final point be on amendment the issue here which relate to amendment from other hon member that will be support be require provider of regulated television selection to give significant prominence to designate internet programme service it be vital that the digital platform for on demand tv do not exclude public service broadcasting content or relegate it to hard to find recess of their site the wording of the bill require such content to be give appropriate prominence which we fear be too weak raise the requirement to significant prominence would well ensure that public service broadcasting have the level of prominence that the view public would expect there be other amendment that welcome and support particularly new clause and as they extend the variety of and the commitment to public service broadcasting and the content that viewer would want to see for information intend to call those who have table amendment before other member call sir john whittingdale you be absolutely right madam deputy speaker have an amendment that would like to speak to it might be slightly unusual for the person who be the minister take the bill through committee then to seek to amend the bill on report but be sure it be not unprecedented and hope my amendment be nevertheless helpful to the government it be certainly my intention that it should be have take the bill through committee and it have already be subject to lot of scrutiny by the culture media and sport committee in this house and in the other place and with the publication of draft bill be therefore slightly surprised to see the number of government amendment that have be table most be relatively minor and technical and welcome the measure that would correct the anomaly around independent national radio require it to continue to broadcast on am even though few and few people be now access radio by those mean it be right to remove that anomaly amendment address local television which be the invention of my right hon friend the member for south west surrey jeremy hunt although it have have somewhat chequer history it be successful in number of area across the country particularly outside london rightly the government have consult recently on whether they believe there be long term future for local tv and be optimistic they will conclude that they would like it to continue the bill will ensure that those broadcaster that the government regard as make an important contribution should continue to thrive in different medium landscape that be the purpose of the prominence provision which safeguard public service broadcaster to ensure that whatever mean viewer choose to access television they can find those public service broadcaster easily local television be not currently include on the list of channel that should have due prominence as we move forward into an age when more and more people rely on internet protocol television to access channel it will become increasingly hard for they if local tv be not obviously available on iptv set have sky glass television which be an iptv set and at the moment can not get local television on it at all one reason for that and the reason the government have previously give for not include local tv on the list of channel to be give prominence be the absence of an app to deliver local tv when be fill in for the minister over the past few month have meeting with local tv and be tell that an app will be forthcoming quite soon that will allow local television to be receive by iptv the government suggest in letter to my right hon friend the member for tunbridge wells greg clark that they see difficulty with that and that because there be large number of local television channel it would be difficult to give all of they individual prominence however be assure by local television that they intend to come forward with single app which will be available on number of major platform and ensure that specifically choose geographical location in the country will receive the specific local tv channel that be appropriate for that area we be only talk about one app the under secretary of state for culture media and sport say in his letter that the government will continue to monitor the situation and consider increase the availability of local content as we know medium bills do not come along every day and this be our single opportunity to update the law cover the range of medium service it be likely that there will not be another opportunity for some considerable time my amendment would allow ofcom at future date to recommend the inclusion of local tv app as and when it emerge in the prominence regime it would ensure that the bill future proof the regime so that it can be amend in such way hope the government will consider adopt that measure understand it be unlikely that they will accept my amendment but ask the minister whether she will continue to look at this issue and if the government believe it be appropriate consider table an amendment to that effect in the house of lords on new clause regard the abolition of section of the crime and courts act be slightly surprised to learn from my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice that the inclusion of firm pledge to repeal section which be not just in the conservative manifesto but repeat in that of be drafting error it do not strike at the time that either the initial pledge or the second one be draft error be my right hon friend say that there be no draft error in the manifesto there may have be be not quite sure which other my right hon friend might be refer to but be pretty certain that that be not one of they nobody ever say that they object to the cost protection for the press contain in section the argument against section be always shorthand argument that essentially claim falsely that it would require publisher to pay the cost of other and that only relate to one small part of section my right hon friend be right but as think point out on second reading not single major publisher have choose to apply for recognition by the press recognition panel through join recognise regulator but be that not precisely because the government fail to move the incentive that encourage people to join as the minister responsible who say that we would not implement section have considerable talk it be make plain that if the government have implement section no major publisher would apply for recognition my right hon friend talk about the carrot and stick and his new clause would require the government to look for alternative incentive to encourage publisher to apply for recognition even if the exist carrot and stick be remove he do not go into detail in his speech about what alternative incentive there might be it sound slightly like reference to marlon brando make an offer you can refuse the press have be absolutely plain they object to any regulator that carry the stamp of government approval that be the fundamental principle that have cause every publisher to say that they will not apply for recognition my right hon friend know that it be not government regulator the press recognition panel be establish by the royal charter on self regulation of the press the conservative party establish that as royal charter rather than regulatory body for precisely that reason to accommodate that wish of the press do not suggest it be government regulator but nevertheless any regulator that require government approval through the press recognition panel be view by the press as have government stamp of approval which they regard as unacceptable my right hon friend speak about the discussion he have but he would agree that the stick and the carrot at that time be think to be necessary to persuade red top publisher such as the daily mail and the sun to join regulator recognise by the prp what do not think he anticipate indeed nobody anticipate it at the time be that not single major publisher would agree to co operate with the regime that be be put in place that include the guardian the independent the observer and the financial times not one major publisher say that it would co operate with the system that be put in place so it have plainly fail for that reason alone the government should revisit the issue remove section and instead encourage those who do not currently accept the ruling of an independent regulator to join the one in existence which be ipso know that my right hon friend and will not agree on this point but his suggestion that it be somehow an oversight to include commitment to repeal in the manifesto of and be simply not correct he will be aware that there be unanimity among all the major publisher that section represent an attack on media freedom it be not just the publisher who hold that view many campaign organisation such as reporter without borders have actually downgrade the uk press freedom rating because of the existence of section and it be certainly view as an infringement of media freedom this be one of the issue on which my right hon friend and agree may suggest that those who wish to follow this up afterwards read book call the laughter of triumph by ben wilson it be about william hone and the fight for free press back in the press should not be force into any government regulation there should be the law of the land and that be it be extremely grateful to my right hon friend hope that this be not the only issue on which we agree but it be certainly one on which we hold the same view for that reason be sorry that my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice will press his new clause to vote because shall not support he on it we should remind ourselves why we be here it be because those who be describe by alan bates the leader of the horizon scandal complainant as small skinny people need redress against the huge overbearing press the hack off website point out that in only of more than complaint be uphold by ipso only case in total which be minuscule number be that sign that the system be work do not think success can be judge simply on the number of complaint uphold indeed as we have see in other organisation such as the bbc we may find that large number of those complaint relate to single issue that have generate great deal of concern it be not as simple as there be thousand complaint and only so many be uphold generally however ipso be definitely an improvement on the press complaints commission which go before it it be not perfect no regulator ever be and myself have criticise it for not have yet impose any fine but the atmosphere surround the behaviour of the press be very different from what it be when for instance hacked off be create and when chair the inquiry on phone hacking which lead to the establishment of sir brian leveson report do not want to detain the house any long intend to press the government but not as far as vote should say that urge the government to look at way in which they can support local television through my amendment give the point about section can not support the new clause table by my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth want to express my gratitude for the fact that the bill have be prioritise in this new term and be progress quickly for our public service broadcaster in particular this legislation be long overdue want to refer to my amendment about the language surround prominence for psb such as the bbc itv and channel the bill give public service content an appropriate level of prominence on online service which should make it easy to find not only the app that take we to the bbc or itv on smart tv but to find those channel on the traditional tv guide with which we be all familiar however the culture media and sport committee make the suggestion which have table in the form of an amendment that the word appropriate be perhaps unhelpfully subjective and should be replace with significant the prominence of psb be an existential issue that should not be underestimate so ask the government to consider that suggestion as the bill progress thank the hon gentleman for table his amendment strongly agree with he the issue can not just be leave in the air give the importance of public service broadcasting therefore think that the guidance for ofcom should be strong than the government have recognise so far look forward to hear from the minister what they propose to do about that thank the right hon member for her intervention let move on to the subject of channel and the removal of the restriction on in house production have concern about that change to channel model which have work extremely well for long time although the previous secretary of state be not so keen on its existence or at least its future channel have historically support the independent production sector throughout the uk in place such as my constituency in the far north of scotland but there be concern that allow it to create its own content could destabilise the sector give the government track record on channel my ultimate fear be that this could be use as stick with which to beat the channel although hope that do not happen that be say channel and the independent production sector be integral to each other which be why be glad to see the channel qualify independent commitment to the sector increase to and to hear that any change be likely to be very gradual allow the market to adjust accordingly that can only be good thing come to the new clause table by the hon member for worthe west sir peter bottomley on list event the government must take his proposal forward so that major sporting event such as the olympics the euros wimbledon and the world cup remain free to air in their entirety in an increasingly digital first world digital right must be include in the list event regime let turn to subject that be close to my heart early this week ben stokes say that england test win over india be his great triumph since he have become england captain think we can all take pleasure in that regardless of which of the four corner of the united kingdom we inhabit acknowledge the nod from my colleague on the scottish national party benches the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands for which thank he courteously feel that this sort of share cultural moment should be available for everyone to watch on free to air television my amendment would enable people to see cricket test and one day international on free to air tv each summer and hope that member will strongly consider support it on the subject of local radio something that have mention in the past and be beat up about when be councillor long ago table amendment to to broaden the scope of the requirement in local radio broadcasting licence so that the current scope of local material as news information and other speak material and music be retain if only could have hear myself say those word all those year ago can see the good that it do it would not be right for the bbc to be leave as sole provider of local speech radio on similar point welcome part of the bill which safeguard the future of the industry with relation to voice activate smart device local radio be integral to uphold democracy point make many time by many of we in this place it provide trust news and information particularly during an emergency as we see during covid and also provide entertainment that be especially important to my constituent who as may be imagine often face long drive across very large rural area new clause and amendment to relate to section and our press subject already mention by number of members today ten year ago all the party make commitment to the victim of press abuse that we would introduce the system of regulation recommend in the leveson report to protect the public from press wrongdoing we in this country benefit from vibrant and rich medium as be point out in an urgent question early today but whereas our broadcasting medium be the envy of the world our print medium languish at the bottom of international league table when it come to public trust and confidence however the government now seek to repeal section although they have no plan to replace it with any alternative mechanism of independent and impartial regulation that not only leave local and independent newspaper unable to defend themselves against expensive litigation in the form of strategic lawsuit against public participation but make it hard for normal person to take legal action against large publisher as they say those with the deep pocket win these amendment offer two way forward new clause and amendment and would permit the repeal of section but not before there have be consultation on alternative incentive for the leveson system amendment would repeal the part of section that would disadvantage unregulated newspaper but keep the part that protect local independent title that have do the right thing and sign up to regulation under either of those amendment national newspaper would face no detriment at all for their potentially bad behaviour there be no free speech reason to object to they but they allow we to show our support for the victim of press abuse and for the underlie principle of independent regulation many sensible amendment have be table to this bill and be glad that the majority of we in the house and indeed the industry be sing from the same hymn sheet the world and the way in which our medium operate have change beyond recognition since the communications act and and my party will be very pleased to watch this bill make its way swiftly through both houses so that our legislation at last reflect the world we live in today close by pay tribute to member for the great effort that have be make on all side of this house to make sure that this legislation be fit for purpose call the father of the house be grateful to the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone for preview the suggestion that time shift excerpt from list event be available through public service broadcaster regret that test match be not presently list event because think that this country would have want to see the remarkable part of the test match in india this week some people may have only read press description of ben stokes do backhand flip to the wicket that can be well describe by people such as neville cardus and his successor but it be even well to watch it in real life believe that the number of list event should be expand however as the bbc and other have remind we the number of people watch event on the other side of the world at midnight or four in the morning might be whereas those who would want to watch those event the next day might be million or million believe that the new clause should be accept and hope that the minister will say some comfort word like many other do not propose to push my new clause to division today but do hope that the government will respond by table an amendment or new clause in the house of lords that have the same effect could read out my full briefing but the point have be well make by the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross and may be make by other what be the reason for embrace the future it be not just about linear television there be the opportunity for other right so many right be buy by commercial business outside this country what do they care about what happen in one part of the world broadcasting framework we must have requirement to stop those who think they can make money by make most people not watch key event and make those who do watch pay lot people should be able to watch coverage on ordinary public service broadcasting my belief be that for major event the competition between the public service broadcaster will be sufficient to ensure fair return for those who buy the right do not believe in have an unrestricted auction so that people can buy right that will exclude most people in the country from watch sporting event of great importance there have be example of right holder sky have do this well make an event available on normal public service broadcasting as well as on their own service when one of our national team have get into final pay tribute to sky for do that want to follow up on the word of the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell who talk about genre in public service broadcasting think would table an amendment or new clause that do what he argue for believe that ofcom should have an explicit duty to make sure that public service broadcaster be hold to account and explain how they be meet the requirement for the various part of public service broadcasting public service broadcasting can be very interesting and fully commercial large number of people may want to watch it and it may be very popular but not necessarily religion science and many other area list in the right hon member amendment be important say to the government pay attention to what he have say look to colin browne for what viewer and listener have say and accept the amendment so that the requirement be explicit and the response by the public service broadcaster be open believe that we can make success of this bill know that broadcasting regulation be normally about year behind the technology and remember that about year ago david mellor have to change virtually complete bill on report because so much have change between the bill be draft and its third reading in the house of commons believe that we can make major change and can sum this up to the government in word that someone have offer which be absolutely right do let this opportunity pass by the time to act be now once these moment go behind paywall that the final whistle let we make all major event available to all people at least in excerpt so that they can watch they in daylight call the shadow secretary of state refer hon and right hon member to my entry in the register of members financial interests thank all colleague particularly my hon friend the members for barnsley east stephanie peacock and for eltham clive efford and my right hon friend the member for exeter mr bradshaw for their service on the public bill committee and for do really diligent and careful work in general my colleague on the labour benches and be supportive of this bill it have be too long in the making and the delay have hold back the uk world lead public service broadcaster they have also affect the productivity of the creative industry as whole and the public service broadcast sector be such large and important part of the creative industry and their commissioning the last time broad change be enact for our public service broadcaster be in think we can all agree that the world be now very different place but well late than never broadly speak believe this be good bill and we support it our public service broadcaster be fundamental part of british cultural life if we do not have they we would want to invent they and this bill give they and the wide broadcasting industry the tool they need to survive in the modern world the bill contain crucial measure to ensure that uk broadcaster can thrive in digital age by protect radio service when they be access on smart speaker and by ensure the fair prominence of public service broadcaster on smart tv will return to the question of prominence shortly however the bill do not take full advantage of the opportunity it create to shape the broadcasting industry for the next decade although we will not seek to disrupt or delay the passage of the bill there be area where we believe it can and should be strengthen and improve hope the minister will listen to our suggestion in the new clause and amendment stand in my name and that of my hon friend the member for barnsley east new clause concern child television for many child and young people public service broadcasting be an important part of how they learn and in particular how they learn to understand the world it be central part of how their curiosity be ignite the bill as draft fail to recognise that importance by neglect to try to understand how the view habit of child and young people be change provision for child by public service broadcaster be under threat because so few child now watch live tv the top rat programme on cbbc attract as few as viewer child carry entertainment in their pocket and they can and do switch between various app and platform in matter of second which be understandably affect investment in child programming that create vicious cycle as investment and resource decline so too do the quality of the output instead of try to provide high quality uniquely british public service content for child broadcaster be then force to prioritise profitable content that offer little public value and can be sell internationally our new clause would enable the government to take an important first step recognise the problem and explore route forward it would be shame not to take advantage of this opportunity to shape child programming for the future in what be suppose to be forward look piece of legislation ask the minister to give that some consideration the bill also fail to go far enough on age classification the hon member for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates and for south west devon sir gary streeter have table amendment in this area for which thank they alongside our new clause which show the breadth of feeling across the house all these amendment look to tackle the same underlying issue which be that there be no consistency in how age rating be currently use on streaming site parent and child alike deserve to be able to have full confidence in age rating so that when they pick something to watch they can trust that it will be safe and age appropriate rating must be easily understand and recognisable by the public and underpin by transparent set of criterion that take into account british attitude on everything from swear to violence and anything else we might think of new clause do not in my view overengineer the issue it do not require every on demand service to use any specific age rating provider although we should collectively recognise that the british board of film classification be great example of good practice our public service broadcaster already follow stringent rule which may mean that age rating be not appropriate for their content but where age rating be already use there should be clear criterion against which ofcom can measure their success and quality the bill also fall short when it come to digital right to list event list event have already generate some debate and have great deal of sympathy with the point make by other hon and right hon member about various sporting event this legislation be suppose to contribute to the future proofing of public service broadcaster but feel that to do that it need to go far our new clause seek to address that the right to broadcast moment of national sporting importance be offer first to channel such as the bbc and itv enable the broad possible range of british people to watch the like of wimbledon and the olympics we agree with the aim of the bill which be to protect and modernise the system while make few change to ensure that it be appropriate in the digital age but unfortunately the bill fall short in this regard by not extend the regime to include online clip and highlight the bill risk prevent thousand upon thousand of people from feel the joy of watch british athlete or cricketer compete on the world stage particularly when those competition be happen far away as happen this week with ben stokes and consider that the next man football world cup and the next two olympics after paris will the hon lady give way be happy to give way the shadow secretary of state mention sporting event in addition to protect the six nations for we all in group would she accept the principle that scottish welsh and northern irish football fan should have the same access to their national team as english fan do at present of course would and be glad to confirm what my hon friend the member for barnsley east say in committee if the hon gentleman be try to press on specific aspect be also happy to confirm that we would support the new clause table in his name if it be push to vote will be interested to see whether colleague in his party will support our new clause on gaelic broadcasting as they seem not to vote for it in committee it will be interesting to see whether they take up that challenge as well it be likely that even in the near future key sporting moment will take place in the middle of the night in this country despite the fact that conservative ministers order review of this in there be simply nothing in this bill as draft to update the list event rule so that clip or highlight from those event do not get stick behind paywall our new clause seek to guarantee that action be take on this issue but it be flexible enough to accommodate whatever mechanism be identify as most appropriate follow their review also note new clause in the name of the father of the house the hon member for worthe west sir peter bottomley which be more prescriptive than our but address the same issue if ministers can not lend their support to either of these amendment they should at the very least publish the response to the review in full it would be helpful if the government take up the suggestion from my hon friend the member for barnsley east that criterion be publish so that we get clear sense rather than have this ad hoc debate sympathetic though may be to certain sporting event there be the question of national fairness that be principle and also the question of what criterion we should use to add to the listing regime new clause seek to fix another problem with the bill which be that it fail to take the rise popularity of podcast into account have mention podcast before on the floor of the house and it give great pleasure to mention they again when discuss the regulation of selection service for audio content some million adult listen to podcast every week it be emerge as format that encourage collaboration new partnership interesting discussion and the presence of range of politician and other personality who have something interesting or unique to say it seem counterintuitive therefore to exclude this fast grow audio medium from the bill for example the bill as draft guarantee access to the lbc breakfast show with nick ferrari but not to the news agents podcast some of we will be listen to both and we expect similar treatment for both this new clause would simply provide that consistency new clause be design to ensure that public service content be available to linear service as well as online part of the media bill introduce new measure to allow public service broadcaster to meet some of their remit requirement through their online service and on demand channel give that streaming and on demand be grow rapidly this seem reasonable forward look change however there be still million of people who watch their television through traditional broadcast set up this group of people primarily include old resident family in rural area and those struggle with bill as result of the cost of living crisis it be crucial that they can still access public service content as usual this new clause would give ofcom the mean to assess whether public service broadcasting delivery on linear service be adequate and if it find that provision to be inadequate it would have the power to set bind quota have already mention new clause which encourage the secretary of state to consider and take advice on whether gaelic language service should be recognise as public service broadcaster in its own right this be raise by my hon friend the member for barnsley east in committee bbc alba the gaelic language television service provide by mg alba and the bbc be huge asset provide wide range of high quality programming for gaelic speaker to enjoy and sustain around job half of which be in economically fragile area however despite apparent cross party support for the service gaelic language broadcasting be still not recognise in legislation across the board in the same way as other minority language service be that be not to say that gaelic language broadcasting can be directly compare to welsh broadcasting for example but it be an acknowledgment of the importance of language to our cultural life language be daily expression of our history and gaelic language broadcasting be an important forum for that expression it should therefore be consider for recognition in law really hate to say this but it be worth point out in the context of gaelic and welsh that the situation for gaelic be very precarious indeed it be strong enough in some of the western isles but we need to remember that it need to be nurture big time now the hon gentleman make valid and valuable contribution my hon friend the member for barnsley east the shadow minister with responsibility for medium have meet those body recently we understand the point that he be make and take they fully on board this new clause table in my name and that of my hon friend be not prescriptive as to how we break the cycle it leave multiple option open to the secretary of state turn to clause and the amendment table in the name of the right hon member for camborne and redruth george eustice who make his point early the phone hack scandal lead to section of the crime and courts act that scandal involve egregious act and the treatment of victim of crime or tragedy by some section of the medium be disgusting abuse of power we all say that that should never be repeat the majority of british journalist be decent and honourable but there be some who even now continue to drag the good name of that profession into disrepute that profession be cornerstone of our democracy and it be important that the public be able to trust it but at the moment we be at risk of the public lose faith in the profession of journalism as be certainly also the case before section be create and before that scandal be expose we on the labour benches want press that be regulate in way that make it accountable for its reporting and that meet the high ethical and journalistic standard we want to see financially sustainable free press in the uk that can carry on hold power to account clause repeal section of the crime and courts act but if the right hon member for camborne and redruth push his amendment to division this evening we will support it because it offer way through by keep some of what he refer to as the carrot indeed by remove some of the stick his amendment would incentivise more publisher to join up with an approve regulator for the reason that he have outline much more coherently and clearly than can now we thank he for work co operatively with we it be interesting to hear that the opposition intend to support my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice as they abstain in committee if future labour government repeal section would they put in place an equivalent or similar measure thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention but be speak about amendment which we will support for the reason that the right hon member for camborne and redruth set out want to see publisher protect from defamation case bring by russian oligarch and other wealthy individual or corporation look to evade scrutiny in the public interest the government have promise to do more to protect people from slapp but they have yet to come forward with concrete proposal we would like to see those measure bring forward as they be need to secure our free press we also look forward to see the private member bill of my hon friend the member for caerphilly wayne david on this subject it be an important principle that ordinary citizen should be able to access justice as the right hon member for camborne and redruth say amendment would remove the stick if that encourage more publisher to join the approve regulator it would create more compliance with the arbitration scheme which be another reason why we support the amendment how will the government protect publisher from slapp and give complainant access to justice acknowledge the amendment and new clause table by my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell in addition to cover many of the issue that also support he clearly care about the care that public service broadcaster should take in consulting and fully represent their audience in both their workforce and their output ask every culture medium and sport organisation meet where be the woman where be the people of colour where be the people from working class community those question have to be answer both horizontally and vertically and my right hon friend make that case extremely well before closing wish to raise couple of concern with the minister on government amendment to those amendment appear to lack clarity and purpose and they may weaken the position of public service broadcaster in future negotiation with commercial broadcaster urge the government to reconsider they and at least to make it clear to the house what problem they be try to solve we support the bill in general term hope members will join in support the amendment have outline include amendment table by the right hon member for camborne and redruth and our new clause on gaelic we feel that these amendment would strengthen the bill benefit people across the country and help to support our broadcaster in the come year be pleased to speak in support of amendment table in my name and the name of other hon member generally welcome this bill as valiant attempt to bring the law and regulation up to date in fast move sector of our society namely broadcast and on screen entertainment will focus on part which deal with on demand programme service and in particular clause which will usher in comprehensive review to be undertake by ofcom of audience protection and the production of video on demand code this welcome bill reflect how many people watch their entertainment today my two old grandchild age and rarely watch anything on television but they be always on their tablet or smartphone they have no concept of see what be on the box in the evening and maybe even record it as my wife and still do they simply source and download what they want to watch when they want to watch it via video on demand it be therefore important that we ensure the very good protection be in place not so much for they they be both adult now but for my year old granddaughter my seven year old grandson and even my two year old granddaughter who have her own tablet on which she watch peppa pig and the wheel on the can confirm that the wheel go round an awful lot laughter after year be so sick of hear that song ensure adequate audience protection measure for video on demand be vital and clause make commendable start but believe that amendment shade of which be mirror in amendment table by member on both side of the house as be mention by the shadow secretary of state would enhance that protection the amendment contain the follow reasonable provision when consider the adequacy of age rating ofcom must report on the extent to which any age rating use by provider be clear and well understand by consumer underpin by published and transparent set of standard and inform by regular and substantive consultation with the uk public do not think that be ask too much and therefore hope the government will consider it carefully the government have say that the bill objective be to bring in strong protection from harmful or age inappropriate show through new ofcom video on demand code amendment simply set out objective criterion to achieve this aim with regard to age rating all it require be that age rating be clear transparent and reflect uk expectation about what be age appropriate that be not high bar to expect service to meet as other have say we be very fortunate in the uk to have try and trust classifier of content namely the british board of film classification which have be age rat our movie ever since first go to the picture in tiverton to see james bond in wonder how many colleague remember that underwater film and probably for lot long than that the bbfc now rat online content and video on demand opinion poll and survey tell we that parent understand and trust the bbfc rating system my informal survey of parent in my constituency over the past few week have confirm that it be the gold standard and the threshold against which ofcom can consider the sector as whole it be therefore reassure that netflix apple and amazon all use bbfc rating for their video content amendment would not force every content producer to use bbfc rating but it would help to ensure that each rating system be fit for purpose that be the bare minimum we can do to prevent commercial vod service from expose child to harmful content because sadly all be not well in this sector it grieve to say that that be particularly so in relation to disney the current rating free for all have see classify scene of sexual abuse as suitable for nine year old and scene of graphic misogynistic violence or offensive antisemitic stereotype as suitable for year old that be low than it classify some of its star wars and superhero content until we hold service to minimum standard we risk erode public trust in age rating as child protection measure and thus perpetuate this entirely preventable harm the problem with disney and be that for most of we the brand conjure sense of safety and security that be no long warrant when people of my generation hear the word disney we think of bambi or cinderella so the think that our grandchild be in the next room watch video be intrinsically reassuring but that would be an error of judgment because much of its content be now dark and explicit disney rating system be very different from the bbfc and it be base on dutch system transparency and consistency must be part of the new vod code and ofcom should consider the current lack of coherence and consistency in its review and future work amendment do not seek to change the scope of the bill or prevent new innovation in audience protection it be not about mandate any particular solution most of we know and respect bbfc age rating but nobody will be force to adopt age rating where they be not appropriate or not expect such as on service operate by public service broadcaster it be purely about set objective benchmark standard to ensure that where age rating be use they be effective for the purpose of child protection as that be the state purpose of the bill hope the amendment will attract government support it be not my intention to divide the house on amendment but hope that the excellent minister will introduce similar amendment in the other place if she do not be confident that similar amendment will be table in the other place that be likely to be support and certainly would not vote against they when they come back to this place call the snp spokesperson want to respond briefly to the issue just raise by the hon member for south west devon sir gary streeter wonder whether he have look at my new clause the definition of on demand service be not as he imagine in the communications act it cover only those service whose principal purpose be the provision of programme so service such as those on the ipad or console would not be cover by the legislation as it stand the legislation be specifically about those whose principal purpose be to do with provide programme it will cover fire stick for example or sky glass as be mention by the minister but it will not cover those people watch on playstation or on demand service on ipads so the prominence regime would not apply for those who be not watch on something whose principal purpose be television anything in the bill that relate specifically to on demand service therefore even when it come to age rating or some of the other requirement we be put on on demand service will apply only to sky glass fire tv and those sort of thing that be why table new clause which would amend the bill to recognise how quickly thing move as number of member have point out the way that we consume medium change very regularly and it have certainly change dramatically in the year since media bill be previously propose therefore ask ministers to look at the definition of on demand service and consider whether it continue to be appropriate if it do not new clause would ensure that ofcom be able to regulate all those place where people watch television originally table the new clause because of the incredibly high percentage comparatively of people in scotland who watch television exclusively on console without the psb prominence that we might expect in service that be specifically for stream tv will speak to number of the amendment table by member across the house start with those table by the snp have cover my concern about the definition of on demand service and generally do not think that the bill as draft be all encompass enough the issue of small studio which be cover in our amendment to be raise with by the media reform coalition have quota for independent studio be good but some broadcaster have predilection to use only the super indie which account for about of the company that make independent production the small indie account for about some broadcaster commission almost everything from that of the market from company such as endemol those company do great job but they can not be consider to be small independent studio amendment to would encourage public service broadcaster to move outside the scope of those large independent studio and to give some of their work to small studio which would have significant regional benefit new clause which be table by the hon member for arfon hywel williams look at how the region be account for the production hour in each of the region and make sure that production be genuinely regional production rather than lift and shift from somewhere else those issue be important look at the quota system for stuff be do outside the for example be not enough amendment to would augment the regional quota recommendation propose by the hon member for arfon if broadcasting company have to look at the small independent studio it would naturally encourage an increase in regional production have one last point to make about the snp amendment that have not be cover so much by other people new clause table by the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell be similar to my new clause on the diversity of the workforce that be incredibly important make the point in an intervention that be concern by the lack of diversity in public service broadcasting be concern by that lack of diversity on and off screen it be important to look at both area when consider the future of psb this be not about stick nor be it about carrot it be about transparency it be about ensure that all individual be transparent about whether they be meet the test of have something that look like the general population it be clear that parliament do not match the diversity of the population give the incredibly large percentage of man in comparison with woman still in this place even though it have be go in the right direction however we need people on screen to reflect the population be watch the holocaust memorial day commemoration event on saturday night and there be dance group think call chickenshed it be the first time that have see on television dance group involve someone in wheelchair it do not strike how unusual that be until see it on television then think why be this not more common why do we not see more people who look like the general population on tv on more regular basis that be one of those moment that bring home to how rare it be to see people with visible physical disability or in wheelchair on television at all and certainly in dance group it be an amazing dance if hon member get the chance to look it up it be impressive to watch and incredibly powerful the hon member for barnsley east stephanie peacock table new clause or what be call new clause in committee where be absolutely clear that be withdraw my amendment on gaelic in favour of hers also make it clear that have to leave few minute before the end of the sitting and so miss the vote on her new clause in committee be totally supportive of it and the snp continue to be unfortunately have clash that could not get out of and we have only one committee member so could not have someone else vote for the new clause but we continue to support it in committee the hon member for barnsley east and for arfon and speak in favour of the protection of the gaelic language and the importance of it be use as speak in scotland on television mention the importance for place in scotland where gaelic be very minority language there be for example gaelic medium education in aberdeen but people in aberdeen be much less likely to be expose to gaelic outside the education system so thing like gaelic child tv be even more important in aberdeen than they be in place where gaelic be more widely speak they mean that child and young people can be expose to and immerse in the language rather than only have it for the few hour day that they be at gaelic playgroup or school we continue to support what be now new clause have have much communication from bbc alba on this and continue to support its work encourage the government to do what they can to work with the scottish government the bbc and bbc alba to ensure that the situation continue as be and that there be clarity about the future of funding so that everyone agree on the importance of gaelic to be fair to the minister in committee he be also clear about his support for the gaelic language agreement be very much across party but gaelic still do not have the prominence in the bill that we would like it to despite the feeling in the house be in favour of it anything that the government can do to improve the prominence of gaelic in the bill would be great emphasise the point that the hon lady make early in respect of the gaelic language in term of language planning extend the domain of minority language be extremely important that domain encompass the medium include television and radio she be perfectly right to argue for gaelic television to be pick up in aberdeen as well as in the western isles thank the hon gentleman for back up my point think we be very much on the same page be pleased at how much welsh language tv have change and move in recent year congratulate he on his personal work to ensure that that happen he be very clear about the history in committee and it be incredibly interesting to learn about that support the amendment about age rating agree that there should be consistency to they and that disney tend to duck its obligation which make it more difficult for parent to make sensible decision the shadow minister talk about child television and the way that child access some television child in more deprived household be less likely to have access to smartphone or online system and therefore the only way they can access good child content may be through the public service broadcaster and their free to air service want to reinforce the shadow minister point that it be incredibly important to protect those service because of the discriminatory and differential impact their loss would have on the most vulnerable child and those who be least able to access educational programming and have access only to free to air service as they air it be important to protect child television and ensure the provision of good quality child television continue to talk and think about the importance of cbbc and cbeebies when my child be young other service be available but or year ago those channel be at the centre of what child and family be watch hope that they continue to produce high quality useful and interesting programme sometimes we just need to sit our child down in front of the tv and have few minute hon member hear hear it be thoroughly recommend at time the right hon member for hayes and harlington table new clause about genre we agree that there be issue with their removal from legislation hope that the government will agree at least to keep watching brief on that and that they be willing to ensure that ofcom can change the genre cover or encourage extra genre to be add in slightly easy way than be currently possible the process for make change be onerous and if problem be identify it will be difficult for the government to walk back from the position that they be include in the bill give ofcom more flexibility to increase the number of genre would be helpful let deal with the issue about section and the lack of independent regulator meet member of hack off yesterday have be speak to the organisation throughout the bill stage and table an amendment on the subject in committee have concern about the government position on section of the crime and courts act understand that as the temporary minister if that be the correct term the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale say the provision be manifesto pledge still do not think that it be the right thing to do we still have significant issue with the independent press standards organisation the right hon member can not say that impress be state regulator and that it be not independent while at the same time stress that ipso be an independent regulator either they be both independent or neither of they be press back regulator and state back regulator would be close to my definition believe that ipso be not independent as do many people if we look at the result and the number of people who go through ipso process and do not get the recourse that they hop for or that natural justice would give they speak to an individual yesterday whose daughter have die the second before the young woman pass away be film and post on national newspaper website ipso find that that be not intrusion into grief it be against natural justice that that could happen the individual from hacked off and those who give evidence to the leveson inquiry be tell clearly by those in charge at the time we will make change we will ensure that there be recourse they be promise by those in the most senior position that change would happen yet year on those people be still wait for any meaningful change to occur give everything that they have be through they should not have to continue to fight simply to get the press to behave with little compassion and common sense have massive concern about the government position and will support the amendment that the right hon member for camborne and redruth george eustice table have slight preference for new clause over amendment because the new clause be very similar to the one that table in committee however be happy to take the morally correct position and support amendment my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands will cover the sport issue have be peruse new clause which the hon member table it would establish fund to compensate sport governing body for loss of income for sale of tv right would that be levy on the sport governing body which the government would redistribute or would the money come from general taxation it be not clear how it would be pay for do not mean to be difficult but the amendment be in the name of my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north and be say that he will cover the information about they be sure that he would be willing to take an intervention on that point and provide the answer have magnanimously allow he to lead because know very little about sport he know far more about it than so it make sense for we to divide up the amendment want briefly to cover terrestrial television and specifically new clause which the hon member for moray douglas ross table and amendment which my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north and table the scottish affairs committee do an excellent piece of work on that and congratulate my hon friend the member for perth and north perthshire pete wishart and the rest of the committee on all their work the committee find that about third of user in scotland access television only through freeview or digital terrestrial tv our amendment ask about the percentage of people who access television through mean other than terrestrial tv my big concern which make clear on second reading and in committee be about the potential for terrestrial television service to stop accidentally if the government refuse to make commitment about those service future we could end up with the network degrade accidentally with nobody willing to make investment in they because the government have not be clear about their future would like the government to make clear statement about what those service will look like in future we want to ensure that our constituent can continue to access they and that there be no impact on the most vulnerable and those who live in the most rural area the bill try to strike balance between the right and the responsibility of public service broadcaster everything that the government do in regulate they be about strike that balance they outline the recognise public service broadcaster right and their responsibility to show certain genre and provide high quality television as result of fulfil those responsibility those broadcaster have the right to prominence on on demand service it be reasonable to consider public service broadcaster as different from other broadcaster because they have those responsibility which other do not share the change to radio be also important it be good to hear cross party commitment to and positivity about radio in committee in the recent extreme weather event people have rely on the radio they need to know for example that tree have fall down on north anderson drive and that they can not access the haudagain slip road my friend who live in oxfordshire have no electricity because of recent storm and could get update only by listen to their car radio radio be incredibly important for resilience and be pleased that member across the house recognise that in committee as have make clear the snp will not oppose the bill on third reading change which be long overdue need to be make however there be some gap in the bill include issue around future proofing that have not be adequately address as the shadow minister do thank everyone on the bill committee particularly the hon member for arfon it be pleasure to speak in the debate about this important legislation and to hear cross party support for the bill and the work do in committee on second reading in which take part and now on report warmly welcome the bill and the work do by the minister for media tourism and creative industries and her team as well as by the interim minister the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale in the early stage will focus on new clause which table the new clause look at what be not in the bill and what have be omit which hope the minister will consider during she sum up and in the bill remain stage protection for digital terrestrial television and radio broadcast service that people receive via an aerial need to be write into the bill new clause would put in law for the first time legal protection for these crucial life line service it would put duty on the government to keep issue multiplex licence and on ofcom to make available sufficient radio spectrum currently these service be guarantee only until with the risk that they could be switch in in just six year minister hint at second reading that these service will have long shelf life than which be welcome however will focus my remark on the scottish affairs committee of which be member and our report which will come to because at the committee the minister say what happen after be live question agree that it live question which be why we need live answer to the issue welcome the minister positive comment in committee and those of the secretary of state on second reading indeed quote speech by the secretary of state there be lot of positivity about what be hear from the government and hope they will go step far by take on the conclusion have come to in new clause no one be push against the tide on the growth in streaming but terrestrial television often refer to as freeview and broadcast radio still account for the bulk of view and listen across the united kingdom come to the issue from scottish angle as represent scottish constituency and be member of the scottish affairs committee where we discuss this at length but the issue affect people across the united kingdom research from ipsos in show that most adult have watch digital terrestrial television in the last year and of adult watch digital terrestrial television every week some listen to broadcast radio weekly the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman be right to highlight the very good scottish affairs committee report on the subject and she mention the issue as the report say on page almost third of household in scotland only use digital terrestrial television service to watch television in the first quarter of paragraph highlight correspondence to the committee from laurie patten director of strategy and regulation at arqiva who argue that scotland great rurality than the uk average its island community and its comparatively old population make terrestrial tv service especially important in scotland that be why we make that issue so prominent in the report have continue to raise the matter with ministers and propose new clause the hon member for aberdeen north be right to say the issue be important not only to people in rural community and old population and that it have an impact on some of the most vulnerable in society the campaign group broadcast have assemble coalition of group represent those who rely on broadcast service the most they include old people who rely disproportionately on terrestrial television some of those age and above only watch their medium news and programme through that mean and they often struggle to access ip content age uk be member of the coalition their charity director caroline abrahams say while broadcast tv and radio be enjoy by many across the uk it be especially important for old audience particularly those on low income live alone many old people value the current universal service and would struggle to afford alternative such as subscription service because they be free to air they be also lifeline to people on low income or live in digital poverty who often struggle to afford the additional cost of subscription streaming service and the cost of superfast broadband connection that be require to access they elizabeth anderson chief executive office of the digital poverty alliance say for the million live in digital poverty in the uk tv and radio broadcast service be vital source of news public education and entertainment the universality of access to broadcast service must be paramount whilst many service have see rush to digital only delivery apply this to tv and radio when so many lack the device skill and connectivity package to access internet base medium would simply push million of people deep into financial and social exclusion the hon gentleman word strike chord with because he highlight exactly the issue in my vast far fling constituency in the strath and glen of sutherland caithness ross and cromarty there be many folk who can not afford such service precisely as he be say be glad he be say what he be say and be listen with very great interest it be important that this issue be air the hon gentleman represent an extremely rural part of northern scotland my constituency be not quite so rural but many people in moray experience similar challenge to those of his constituent in the far north my hon friend be make some excellent point and be hesitant to interrupt he although would not sell his constituency short my constituency be also very rural our constituency in common with many of the rural constituency in scotland be very low down the league table of superfast broadband coverage as much as people might be able to afford or want streaming service they do not physically have access to they at least not yet do he agree that make his new clause even more important be grateful to my hon friend for that point and for support my new clause will come on to not just the affordability but the availability of superfast broadband to get streaming service highlight the importance of broadcast service for rural constituent include mine in moray as well as those of my hon friend the member for banff and buchan david duguid and the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone graham biggs chief executive of the rural services network have amplify that point say that the issue of safeguard dtt and radio be of fundamental importance to rural area where the population be much old than the national average and the least well serve by broadband connectivity we strongly support the broadcast campaign have be extremely encourage by the work of that campaign to get some movement from the government on the issue as my hon friend the member for banff and buchan highlight the issue of broadband connectivity be of huge concern to constituent in his area as well as in my moray constituency large part of scotland and rural area around the uk do not have reliable high speed broadband so stream tv be not an option have little confidence that the problem will be solve by particularly give some of the problem we have see with the roll out of the programme in scotland even if that roll out succeed all the target be meet and high speed broadband be deliver across the country the other measure that we must look at be broadband take up ey have recently undertake study on that predict that regardless of whether high speed broadband be roll out more than million property in the uk will still not have high speed broadband subscription in well beyond as specify by my new clause the report make number of other worrying finding and paint compelling picture of the genuine dependence that million of the most vulnerable member of our society have on broadcast service to stay connected and in touch any move towards an online only system of tv distribution without the option of digital terrestrial television would put significant group of people at risk of be leave behind as for why have table new clause and why be look for certainty from the government both they and ofcom be conduct review of the tv market minister have urge we to await those finding but be not far away and if these service be to remain it be crucial that we attract investment and ensure that they remain commercially viable to do that as the hon member for aberdeen north correctly say they need certainty from the government the danger be that without that long term certainty beyond where the minister have accept there be live question broadcaster might run down their service and the technology might not be update if they get certainty from the government they can put in investment to ensure people be not without these crucial service and be not leave isolate if the commercial viability of the service be lose while million of people be still rely on it there be real risk that perversely the government would have to step in and use taxpayer money to keep the service go my constructive proposal would not only help keep people connect but in the long run perhaps save taxpayer money surely it be well to provide the long term guarantee now that would enable that investment and deliver good quality universal service for year to come thank the minister the interim minister and the secretary of state and other who have listen to my concern on this issue meet the minister just last week and will continue the dialogue on this because it be crucial element that we should be debate in this house hope we will get some movement from the government as my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale say media bills do not come along often so this be an opportunity for this minister this government and her department to put my new clause into the bill and give that guarantee go forward that would allow the investment to be make and secure the commercial future for dtt ensure that people in moray across scotland and around the uk can continue to rely on those service for many year to come first may apologise for my late arrival to the debate madam deputy speaker seriously underestimate hon member capacity for brevity on the previous business this afternoon would like to speak to my new clause and to refer briefly to new clause and clause thank my hon friend the member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman for her work with in committee order it will not be possible for the hon gentleman to refer to new clause because he be not here to move it at the beginning he be fine to speak to new clause thank you for that guidance madam deputy speaker new clause seek to establish broadcasting and communication authority for wales that new independent body would have responsibility for and oversight of broadcasting and media matter in wales seek to reflect the need of welsh audience under my new clause shadow authority would fulfil the function of that body before its establishment month after the passing of this act the report by the independent commission on the constitutional future of wales recommend that move some members will know that the commission be set up by the welsh government and be under the chairmanship of the former archbishop of canterbury rowan williams it report last week and one of its conclusion be that there be need to look at the devolution of broadcasting an independent authority to regulate would be an integral part of that provision recent event have show that there be real need for such an authority in wales some member will know about the internal issue at the welsh language channel which make the argument that the current broadcasting framework be unsustainable worry about the relatively low interest from the department for culture media and sport in this matter the bill give the secretary of state further decision make power but if successive minister refuse to meet the chair of as have happen worry that they can not be trust to make the right decision in respect of that broadcaster my hon friend be make compelling case and the event of the past week involve the commission vindicate the position he have take the recent difficulty in have be very damaging for the channel my firm view be that if the matter have be in the hand of welsh government ministers and the senedd which can provide scrutiny and accountability we would not have get to the damaging state we be in thank my hon friend for that point with which entirely agree even welsh conservative members concede that the argument for reserve power over broadcasting have be undermine by what have happen and by the department action or inaction we be concerned about and its funding have plummet since the decision to fund it through the licence fee lead to reduction in staff in its chief executive officer ian jones warn about the effect of huge funding cut and call for tegwch or fair play that be valuable contribution from he independence be clearly at stake we need to remember that there be substantial and hard fought campaign during the to establish the channel indeed we have discussion about that in committee in which the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale make some interesting point have the opportunity in the interim to consult the cabinet paper which obtain from the national archives they show how the threat by the then plaid cymru leader gwynfor evans to go on hunger strike be integral to the then prime minister decision to change course and allow the people of wales our own channel the cabinet paper be very interesting to read and hope you will indulge my quote briefly from they madam deputy speaker be correct in remember that the conservatives have promise separate channel in their manifesto and have break that promise until gwynfor evans threaten his hunger strike thank the hon gentleman for make that point that be what be come on to however further argument arise from that unhappy episode as will show by quote from the cabinet paper they state that the then home secretary the late willie whitelaw say that the government would withdraw its plan to share welsh language programme between two television channel instead the programme would for an experimental period of three year be broadcast on one channel as have be propose in the party manifesto that be the point that the hon gentleman be make what be more interesting be that the paper say that willie whitelaw still think that the previous plan be preferable but he have agree to change they in response to representation put to he by lord cledwyn and other of the view of informed and responsible people in wales the interesting point be the reference to the view of informed and responsible people in wales in fact in the same cabinet meeting the secretary of state for wales say gwynfor evans the leader of plaid cymru be threaten to go on what he call hunger strike before go on to say that there could be much tension and unpleasantness in wales later in the year if he persist in this intention and there would be danger that plaid cymru would fall into the hand of extreme left wing leader mention no name however later on in the cabinet paper the secretary of state for wales say that it have be make clear in the press that the change be make in response to moderate opinion follow very wide consultation in wales that be the point want to make the argument be make for welsh broadcasting authority reflect settle and responsible opinion in wales as say the constitutional convention have meet and take evidence very widely over two year and have come to the conclusion that broadcasting should be devolve to wales be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way and for give we history lesson on the hard work of gwynfor evans anybody who be interested in this period in the history of wales should watch the great drama that recently commission on the life of gwynfor evans and this campaign in particular be at crymych rugby club at the weekend with rhodri john the actor who portray gwynfor in the drama can indeed recommend that production for anybody to have look at it be very interesting can also recommend the biography of gwynfor evans which make similar point the medium industry in wales be more than we have fantastic production company include cwmni da in my constituency news outlet and radio all kind of thing the propose authority would unite the medium landscape in wales under one regulatory roof and safeguard it from harm include from large conglomerate it would also focus on area that be important to the people of wales the labour welsh government expert panel on shadow broadcasting and communication authority for wales propose that public interest journalism sport and child medium be area of specific focus due to their cultural significance position in relation to welsh language ambition and impact on long term sustainability among other reason the welsh government therefore propose shadow broadcasting and communication authority for wales look to those on the labour front bench as potentially the next government to give we reassurance that it be their intention to establish that authority as well as the intention of the welsh labour government in cardiff wales need to have say on its own medium landscape to ensure that what work for we be what we get prominent commentator such as professor tom and mike birtwistle have say that should be build on share principle of social partnership public interest and democratic pluralism that is as they say the welsh political tradition an independent regulator for wales would be well equip to regulate defend and promote our national broadcasting and medium industry in wales and ensure that those value be represent that be my argument in favour of broadcasting authority will say few word on the prominence of on the selection service point that also raise in committee content must be readily discoverable and prominent on television service but seek assurance that the appropriate degree of prominence will not lead to the limiting of coverage to specific audience thereby deprive people of wide range of broadcast this language match that of the electronic programme guide code which allow to be on channel on virgin media in wales until the government should provide clear principle to guide ofcom in draw up the new prominence code so that public service broadcaster designate internet programming service appear prominently and be easily discoverable on screen rise to support new clause and amendment both in my name the bill be substantial piece of legislation and fully support what the government be seek to do through it to bridge the gap in regulation between linear television and internet base on demand platform nobody would argue against the principle that we want to protect child from watch age inappropriate or harmful content that is after all why parliament over many year have bring in legislation that mandate age rating on cinema release restriction on child buy dvd and video and importantly until the relatively recent past watershed for broadcast tv the watershed of course ensure that programme broadcast before pm be generally suitable for child however now that the vast majority of content watch by child and adult be access through on demand streaming service the watershed have become increasingly redundant it do not matter if programme be originally broadcast live after the watershed once it be available to stream online it can be view by anyone of any age at any time that be why we urgently need to apply the same standard of child protection to on demand video as we do to cinema release physical dvd and linear tv while time base watershed clearly can not be adapt for video on demand service we be very fortunate in this country to have world class expertise in apply age rating to video content the british board of film classification have be empower by parliament through the secretary of state to apply age rating across all cinema and dvd release in the uk the bbfc do an excellent job of this as colleague have mention and be global leader in its field it have produce system of age rating that the vast majority of the british population recognise trust and understand importantly its rating be base on regular consultation with thousand of people across britain to ensure that they meet audience expectation we have the relevant age rating expertise already in this country but as it stand the bill will not make use of that expertise amendment would address this matter very simply by explicitly require ofcom to consult the bbfc when draw up the video on demand code the code will set the rule for streaming platform include in relation to age rating why would we not want to ensure that our world renowned government appoint expert be consult as part of that there be similar amendment to the online safety act that require ofcom to consult with the children commissioner and can see no argument against apply the same principle here get age rating right be incredibly important as they will likely become one of the main audience protection measure that platform employ and will of course future proof the bill if parent do not trust the rating they will ignore they and we will then not achieve our aim of protect child that bring to new clause in my name which be similar to the amendment table by my hon friend the member for south west devon sir gary streeter and will reiterate some of his point be very supportive of the theme of my hon friend amendment she make an extremely important point about consistency for parent those of we who be lucky enough to have child find ourselves in forest of different medium that they consume some of which seem to decide the rule and rating on their own of course there be website to go to for third party reference do she agree that it would be sensible to have standardised view for parent to manage consumption by their child as it be the parent primary duty to manage that we have see in the past that the wide medium industry will constantly push the boundary to try to get more under the wire for consumption by young and young people such as in the deterioration of the watershed on terrestrial television if an organisation such as the bbfc set the tone and the standard that must apply online as much as offline agree with every word the very important factor behind the bbfc be that parent trust it it even have an app to search for any film or dvd and it will tell parent not only the rating but exactly why it be there swearing violence or whatever that detailed knowledge be crucial not only to gain parent trust but to create an industry standard as my right hon friend say if we have no industry standard some company will try to get around the requirement if there be commercial advantage the bill should set out exactly that the bill list age rating as one of the option that tier platform such as the provider we have talk about can use to comply with their audience protection requirement but it shy away from set the minimum standard that my right hon friend just mention for what those rating should be the bill be right to recognise that there can not be one size fit all approach research have show that audience have different expectation of video on demand service than they do of those operate by public service broadcaster but where age rating be in use be it not common sense to expect consistent standard my hon friend the member for south west devon talk about and the fact that the film avatar have plus rating even though most parent would think it suitable for much young child whereas series that have scene of sexual coercion be apparently suitable for nine plus the outcome be that parent just turn off the security setting because they do not trust the rating how be parent suppose to understand and apply they if they be not consistent across different platform and provider new clause would set minimum standard for tier provider that choose to use age rating by allow they to use either the bbfc system or one of equivalent transparency clarity rigour and objectivity that have be approve by ofcom the new clause do not seek to mandate the bbfc system although research have find that of uk parent want on demand age rating to be consistent with those for cinema and dvd rather it would set minimum standard across platform that parent can trust we have proof already that that work netflix and prime video have both voluntarily set up innovative partnership to include bbfc rating in their content that kind of collaboration be in the interest of everyone parent child and the platform themselves it show that this can be do without high cost or reduction in consistency but the reluctance of and other to follow suit show why this kind of regulation be need the bbfc system fit the government own definition of good practice for age rating it would surely be preferable for all platform to follow the example of netflix and amazon but we do not need to be overly prescriptive in impose solution instead ask the government to accept that it be the role of parliament not ofcom to set minimum standard to ensure the protection of child from harm new clause would achieve that by require tier platform to apply either the age rat classification system use by the bbfc or system base on transparent set of appropriate standard apply consistently if this house really want to protect child and wish to see trust effective regulatory landscape it be hard to envisage what objection there might be to this provision my amendment be focus on that specific aspect of the bill but they speak to my wide concern about the approach to digital medium regulation in recent year in both this bill and the online safety act on which work with colleague across the house and in the other place to secure strengthen amendment we have give far too much power to ofcom not enforcement power which be need but the responsibility to determine regulatory policy in this bill as in the online safety act parliament be set out only the very basic principle through legislation leave it up to ofcom to draft and consult upon the vast majority of the detail have nothing against ofcom as an organisation we must have an official regulator to ensure that broadcaster and provider adhere to standard require by law however when it come to set policy subscribe to the perhaps old fashioned notion that it be our job as elect member of parliament we can not leave something so important up to the consultation of an unelected body especially when the vested interest at play be so substantial as other hon member have mention once we pass the bill parliament will not get another chance to set the parameter of the video on demand code so we must ensure that the final text of the bill set out what parliament believe to be the appropriate standard of audience protection sadly my concern in this area be well found in the recently enact online safety act parliament decide that age verification check for site and platform host pornography must be highly effective to address the significant problem of young child access violent pornography on social medium and website highly effective be an outcome measure just try hard to prevent child from access pornography do not make platform compliant under that act compliance mean actually stop from come across porn in other word this bill require effective outcome measure and must not give prize to the tech company just for take part yet in the draft consultation that it publish last month ofcom do not set out what the highly effective standard mean so platform and user be none the wiser when it come to what do and do not meet the require legislative standard instead the consultation outline the kind of activity that ofcom would like to see rather than the outcome that it demand give that parliament have task ofcom with adjudicate on what meet the highly effective standard fail to set clear definition be completely unacceptable if ofcom fail to meet the highly effective outcome standard that be clearly lay out in the act it will leave itself open to judicial review from those who take the view that the will of parliament be serious and who wish to see age verification apply in way that make child safe that very concerning but current example demonstrate what may sadly happen to the measure in the bill if parliament leave it to ofcom to decide what constitute effective age rating for video on demand service we can not say that we be not warn do not intend to press my amendment to vote because very much appreciate the secretary of state continue engagement but urge the minister and their lordship to consider the principle of the amendment they be design to set minimum standard for child protection which be currently lack that be our responsibility as legislator so let we do it thoroughly rise to commend my new clause to the house and to speak to new clause and and amendment and this summer will again see scotland again in the final of the man european championship in germany thank to list every game from the final will be available free to air on the bbc and stv itv however once this summer euro final conclude and scotland have safely tuck away the henri delaunay trophy in the hampden trophy cabinet we will be back to the current set up which will maintain paywall for the scotland man national team game last april host roundtable summit on how to make progress on get all of scotland national team match on free to air tv two thing be clear as it stand that would not be an easy or quick fix with umpteen move part and vested interest in the room however there be also willingness to look realistically at what could be do with the right will and resource we see how grassroots participation rate in english cricket slump when the england and wales cricket board sign deal with sky and put almost the entirety of the first class game behind paywall the lack of public interest be such that the ecb effectively have to invent an entire competition purely for terrestrial television as shop window for the sport assume that we be all aware of the billie jean king quote you have to see it to be it no one at the scottish football association stv viaplay the bbc uefa or anywhere else involve in football right be sit there plot to do in scottish football fan they be all rational actor work within the system create by the uk government and uefa to achieve their own goal the hon gentleman be talk about the unanimity of opinion should tell the house that the welsh affairs committee the culture media and sport committee and the senedd culture communications welsh language sport and international relations committee have all call for the six nations rugby tournament to remain free to air for broadcasting indeed the welsh conservatives have whole senedd debate on that matter tomorrow last week meet senior executive from bbc cymru wales who say that lose the six nations for example which be currently share with itv will be blow both to the bbc and to the audience will come to the potential issue face the six nations bit later in my speech but in the meantime be very much look forward to visit cardiff this saturday to watch scotland beat wales in that very competition will the hon gentleman give way on that it be just that the hon gentleman extensive list of event neglect to mention cricket wonder whether there be reason why he have exclude cricket from his list all have seek to add to the list be the six nations competition and any and all qualification match for all home nation national football team as the hon gentleman will be aware be indeed fan of cricket which be probably not majority position in scotland it be obviously not one of the main sport in scotland at this time although the snp will be back amendment table by the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone despite the fact that its propose new clause would cover only the english cricket team give that scotland do not yet have test status it be only matter of time be sure will the hon member give way be go to go back to football but feel that we be stay on cricket so will thank the hon member for his generous remark whether it be cricket football or whatever get people to watch sport in the way that be be advocate so strongly mean that they might become more inclined to take part in that sport themselves which could ultimately improve the health of scotland and the health of the nation the hon gentleman make an excellent point the power of sport be simply huge participate be obviously the good thing for the health of the nation but view sport whatever sport it be be likely to drive up participation rate we have see the opposite with the england and wales cricket board and the sky contract if can cycle back to football for second the problem for scottish football fan be that sometimes the goal of those involved again be talk about uefa the bbc viaplay and all the stakeholder do not coincide with maximise access what be need be change to the system that would change those goal for the well for our fan the system be currently short change fan in scotland while elsewhere on these isle it be very different story football fan in england enjoy free to air coverage of their national team via the current deal with channel and the forthcoming deal with itv viewer in wales enjoy free to air coverage of their national team thank to sub license welsh language coverage and viewer in northern ireland get free coverage of the republic of ireland via rté broadcast while many in northern ireland welcome that appreciate that for other it be akin to have england game broadcast in scotland on channel and stv scottish fan though be leave with the prospect of pay subscription provider to see their team in action that be very unlikely to change without amend legislation to level the play field for scottish supporter similarly these day we be use to murmuring about the six nations be move from its current home on the bbc and stv itv to behind paywall the airtime available to rugby union fan on free to air tv be already incredibly low last year world cup be four yearly aberration as we all know the six nations be rating winner and rugby big annual shop window to the wide public and the player of the future even old relic like can be convince to play again although have try to do so last year it would have be very much for the well if have not middle youth stupidity not mid life crisis yet italian supporter be guarantee to see their team on free to air tv ireland supporter will see their team on free tv as will france supporter but scotland wales and england supporter face watch blank screen if the right be allow to lapse into subscription tv hand the welsh affairs committee which have already be mention and on which my hon friend the member for ceredigion ben lake sit have it right when it recommend in its report on broadcasting in wales that the government add the six nations to group of the listed sporting events to ensure its status on terrestrial tv obviously that be propose in new clause these island will host the man euro championship and there be reasonable chance that all five country might qualify viewer in england ireland and wales will be able to see their team live and in full throughout the qualifying campaign without pay penny beyond the licence fee in case anybody want to challenge on that my amendment would guarantee that right to all across these isle through simple amendment of the exist legislation extend the protection that exist to protect event of national interest in the word of the act scotland journey in the past few year under stevie clark have show how much interest there be across scotland and it be time that the legislation reflect that be grateful to labour plaid cymru and the liberal democrats for their support for the new clause hope that tory back benchers who have be espouse the power of sport and argue that sport should be show on free to air tv will join we in the lobby this evening new clause the related amendment be design to prevent any detriment below certain annual revenue level to govern body and organisation that have their event list and broadcast outside subscription paywall know from my extensive discussion with govern body that they be in something of bind on the one hand they support their sport and want to see it in front of as many eyeball as possible and perhaps on cynical level to have as many eyeball as possible in front of perimeter advertising as well on the other hand they receive decent whack of cash for the tv right fund that go into develop the sport and support the grassroot and that might well take severe knock if the value of the right be cut through list in group fully understand that sport broadcasting right inflation have be significant over the last decade and more understand that it be difficult for an stv to make win bid for scotland right commercially viable due to the size of the tv market in scotland that be make hard still by the fact that uefa have bundle scottish international football right with those of wales and northern ireland to try and draw large bid and more money for itself and the national association although the same right inflation have impact the bbc it do not have the same commercial consideration as an stv or an itv appreciate however that tory culture war have inflict severe damage to the funding level available to the bbc in recent year however the bbc be require to serve all audience across the whole of the uk include provision for those in the nation and region from sporting point of view that simply do not happen we do not know how much the bbc pay to secure yet again the right to match of the day but we do know that it be huge sum that take up huge proportion of bbc sport budget despite the figure not be available it do not take genius to ascertain that per capita spending to secure english sport right vastly dwarf that which be spend on scottish sport right incidentally do not blame bbc scotland for that the blame lie firmly at bbc network door it would seem that the approach by the network be to let scottish football fan eat english cake if bbc scotland be afford the per capita sum use to secure england football right scotland would be in far well position to bid for and secure scotland international right or indeed if bbc alba funding be anywhere near the level of per capita support offer to that would very likely allow bbc alba to secure secondary sub license free to air gaelic coverage in lieu of any action to address this new clause would attempt to solve the funding gap by provide financial support to govern body who could rely on that revenue stream to offset any loss of income cause by group listing that be proportionate cost effective way of ensure that there be no detriment from list while limit access to the fund to those who actually need it rather than those organisation that be already awash with cash of course govern body in the devolved nation be much small be hugely hit by be part of large uk broadcast market but very small domestic market to address the question that the hon member for eltham clive efford ask in an intervention would suggest that if the government be content to flush away nearly billion on unused personal protective equipment they be flush enough to cough up the relatively small sum need to protect both grassroots sport and the principle of national team on free to air tv in committee the interim minister or temporary minister or whatever title the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale be go with in this debate make reference to the scottish government bring forward such scheme if they wish while the tories be take such relaxed approach to the concept of reserved and devolve power perhaps he and his colleague might extend that relaxation to the other power that the scottish parliament have such as the right to hold fresh referendum on independence at time of its choosing whatever the then minister may have say the simple fact be that broadcasting be an entirely devolve matter in schedule to the scotland act section state clearly that the subject matter of the broadcasting act and the broadcasting act be reserve to westminster if it be up to schedule and its list of power reserve to this place would be delete in its entirety but there we be if the act be entirely reserve to westminster so must be the financial implication of measure enact under that amend act it be not up to the scottish government to fix the consequence of the uk government break devolution system and it be entirely in order that the uk government compensate govern body and other whose income fall below threshold if it drop as result of list take together new clause and would not only give group list firm moral footing but give right holder firm financial footing surely that be win for everyone include this government will touch briefly on my other amendment new clause would place the gaelic media service which in partnership with the bbc provide the bbc alba channel on the same statutory footing as its welsh counterpart in the authority which oversee the welsh language channel when the act be pass gaelic broadcasting be restrict to opt out on the two bbc channel and through stv and grampian schedule mg alba which the gaelic media service now operate as do not exist television be entirely analogue and gaelic and welsh language broadcasting be restrict to scotland and wales only my new clause would simply ensure that gaelic language broadcasting have parity with welsh language broadcasting when it come to the consideration of list event it would be an utter nonsense to say that speaker of gaelic have less of an interest in see sport on free to air tv than their welsh speak counterpart yet that be what the current legislation imply bbc alba have develop reputation for high quality sport coverage since its inception it therefore have strategic interest in where sporting right go simply because it have invest great deal of time and money into secure some of those right and broadcast the sport free to air not just in scotland but across these isle on the broadcast campaign welcome the pledge make by the interim minister in committee and be sure that the current minister will back that up in response to that campaign for digital terrestrial broadcasting to continue for many year to come my hon friend the member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman make some good comment even the hon member for moray douglas ross make some comment that agree with which be highly unusual however pledge make by minister have tendency to become pliable when circumstance make it easy to slide away from the original commitment amendment and would simply place into legislation compulsory requirement for public service broadcaster to continue use digital terrestrial television to deliver their service can see no reason why that would be incompatible with those ministerial promise which be why see no reason for the government not to accept my amendment broadcast television have work and as the cliché have it if it ai break do fix it my amendment would keep the government from fix problem that simply do not exist at this point and commend those amendment as well as the other new clause and amendment to which have speak to the house would like to address number of the amendment we have be discuss some support some oppose let start on positive note with new clause which be table by the father of the house my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley the new clause seek to introduce protection for digital on demand coverage of list event include clip and highlight of those event and allow for time shift viewing that be increasingly important for audience as it would enable view on multi use device or the viewing of event that take place overnight in other time zone as we often see with the olympic game and sometimes the world cup depend on where they be in the world there be practical example of how that change would make difference at the olympic game in tokyo the gold win performance by bmx specialist charlotte worthington be watch by only people because it take place in the middle of the night yet in the day that follow different form of short form coverage of the race generate nearly tenfold increase in view it be not just about time shift that can also happen just because that be how people absorb content these day for instance for the commonwealth game in birmingham the tv reach be about low than for the game in glasgow but there be about six time more on demand view of digital clip the problem be that without enhanced regulatory protection what should be share national moment risk be lose to many people behind paywall this bill be genuine opportunity to safeguard the future of list event as they be now view for future generation as it stand the bill offer no protection for digital on demand right yet as say that be now key way in which many people consume such event support the new clause because it would ensure that where possible adequate digital on demand coverage of list event such as those clip and excerpt be make available free of charge to audience in the united kingdom pray in aid the culture media and sport committee of which be member when we look at this question we conclude digital right should be include as part of the listed event regime to reflect sweeping change in how audience consume content since the original legislation be pass we recommend that the government include provision in the bill to enable digital right to be include in the listed event regime without the need for further primary legislation know the government recognise the issue and have consult the industry about it but year later they have not yet report on the finding of their review if those protection be bring in they would broadly mirror the framework that currently provide protection for live coverage the new clause seek to ensure that where right holder grant right for digital on demand coverage it be not do on an exclusive basis and there be an opportunity for audience in the uk to enjoy that coverage for free appreciate that my hon friend the member for worthing west have say he will not press his new clause to vote at this stage but hope the minister be listen and that the government will take this away and move an amendment in the other place that meet the need that my hon friend be try to meet also support amendment table by my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale which offer the possibility for local digital tv service to be give the protection of the prominence regime think he undersell the historic nature of have the minister who take the bill through committee move an amendment on report he say he be sure it have happen before but be absolutely sure it be the first time any minster who take bill through committee stage because of maternity cover have try to amend it on report for parliamentary procedure nerd that alone make it an historic moment but there be also great merit in his suggestion while be refer to he note that there have be various description of he from those on the opposition benches as temporary minister should say to the house from some experience that all minister be temporary at all time the only permanent thing in any department be the permanent secretary revert to the substance of the amendment local tv be an increasingly important part of the landscape it be still very small scale by its definition and it have have rocky past but there be clearly market and demand for it and it be increasingly become part of the broadcasting landscape the only thing would add since the amendment be speak to so well by my right hon friend be that it must apply to genuinely local station it be important to establish that caveat absolutely agree with my right hon friend about local television people talk about specify channel and programme for language but there be many area such as my constituency and his where it be important that local viewer get chance to see their specific area and discussion relevant to they rather than just regional television that be why it be important that local television should be include completely agree with my hon friend there be distinct market for regional tv and local tv in some part of the country the region be so large that large part of what national broadcaster tend to regard as local tv be not local to people and do not register with their interest whereas local tv can genuinely do that as local radio do and have always do wish to speak in support of the various government amendment that cover radio not least because part and of the bill be particularly important in enhance the prospect of radio flourish in future many people have be predict radio demise for some time but the sector be do strongly hope that will continue and anything that encourage that in the bill be extremely welcome some of the amendment remove an out of date requirement on ofcom to impose fine on national analogue station such as talksport if they seek to terminate the broadcasting of analogue transmission before the end of their licence period do not think there be any plan for that to happen but it seem sensible to make such flexibility available not least because analogue transmission and listening be become increasingly rare some of listen to commercial radio be now on digital platform and look ahead to the future seem perfectly sensible amendment to that would ensure dcms consultation before regulation that affect radio selection service be also sensible the measure restate the need to ensure access through voice activate smart speaker massively grow and important part of radio listening and the big tech company that make and operate those speaker and which also provide content clearly need strong regulatory regime to stop any abuse of the market power that those big company have this have be significant debate we also have it in the culture media and sport committee and it be important that the regulatory regime recognise the reality of where power lie in modern broadcasting move to amendment that be less keen on agree with the news media association that the argument for state back regulation of the press have be lose and the amendment introduce eloquently and with great sincerity by my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice be flog horse that be afraid die some time ago do not think there be need for his amendment rise suspect that might happen my right hon friend will know that the royal charter on self regulation of the press which the conservative party establish be still alive and well and the government have no plan for its dissolution my right hon friend amendment seek to revive the argument from more than year ago but think that argument have go the world have move on and the press have move on we have discussion about whether regulation or the application of the law be the appropriate way to do this and submit that the reason why press behaviour have change be simply the effective application of the law and the fact that many newspaper group have have to pay huge amount of money because they break the law in behave the way they do and year ago that lead to the change in behaviour where my right hon friend and would come close together be on slapp case and the need for legislation to allow individual not to be intimidate by rich publishing company know the government have commit to introduce legislation to see those sort of case dismiss at the early possible stage and urge my colleague on the front bench to do that as soon as possible while be in sceptical mode similarly question the need for the various new clause propose by member in all part of the house that would mandate more rigid system of age classification for programme already regulate by ofcom absolutely get the intention behind they which be to protect child from unsuitable content but be instinctively wary of suggestion that would mean one regulator have to consult another before introduce code of conduct ofcom have considerable power and it can operate those power do not think it sensible to try to tie this down to any particular age classification system not least because some public service broadcaster who be pretty responsible in not try to expose content that be unsuitable for child operate system of protection that do not rely on age classification itv have its guidance system and many broadcaster operate system involve pin that sensible parent will keep from their child so that they can be protect at home be that not exactly the point we have world class regulation in the british board of film classification which give we benchmark good arrangement would be for broadcaster and other platform to register with an organisation like the bbfc and have to pay registration fee and for the regulator to regulate that rather than the other way round my right hon friend talk about responsible parent but we need to guide the people who do not know what to look for who be not media savvy and who need some guidance even our public service broadcaster do not always get it right and sometimes there be content that really should not be see by those age and under take my hon friend point but return to my original point give that the bill and indeed our whole regulatory structure be base on ofcom and give that the bill seek to give ofcom proper power to provide in this instance protection for child in an appropriate way introduce another different system would suspect lead to more confusion rather than less that be precisely what the bill will do it will introduce different system at present ofcom be responsible for regulate the public service broadcaster which it do through the watershed and the bbfc be responsible for dvd and cinema we now have completely new landscape which resemble the dvd landscape much more closely because it be available on demand it be therefore sensible to introduce an age rating system base roughly on what the bbfc do because the bbfc not ofcom be the expert in that field fear that we may go down rabbit hole ofcom be the expert in that field but the system be base on film classification the age rating system be design for situation where person go through door and someone make guess whether that person be or or for instance will my right hon friend give way again will give my hon friend one more go take my right hon friend point however the bbfc classifie not just film but item that be stream directly and never release in cinema by tag every rateable incident such as swear word or an episode of violence and use that system to come up with verifiable standardised rating that everyone understand it be exactly the same process as the one that be use to verify video on demand and it be what netflix already use to rate its own video netflix use it but as my hon friend herself say early disney do not there will of course be difference think that overregulating will just lead to disadvantage for people who be try to produce content and that insist on one system that be partly design for one mode of operation may well not work for another operation if ofcom do its job effectively it will achieve what we all want to see which be age inappropriate content not be available to child as have say involve more than one regulator normally lead to confusion and bad regulation than would have exist otherwise as say number of the amendment be wholly desirable and hope that the government adopt they other be less so and hope that the government will resist they close by say that this be very good bill long overdue and wish it well in its future stage it be an honour to follow the right hon member for ashford damian green who like be member of the culture media and sport committee he speak with authority on many of these issue although do not agree with everything he say however certainly agree with he about broadcast highlight of major sporting event and hope the government be listen welcome the position take by labour front benchers who have say they will support amendment be delighted that they have be listen to those of we who have be involve in this issue for number of year and who have support the work of hacked off claim only minor support role other opposition members have do far more than have none the less have be at those meeting and in those discussion at time have take part in debate in which have commit to support the aim and objective of people who have be fight hard through hacked off and be delighted that we be not close the door on they completely today commend the right hon member for camborne and redruth george eustice not just for his amendment but for the way he have negotiate with other on this issue to get we to what consider to be compromise position one that can allow we to go forwards and not close the door completely on the issue of an independent press complaint system as he describe early his amendment remove the stick element which be the element that be most oppose by people work in the press think it would have give they the incentive to join proper independent complaint system none the less it be stick point and in this compromise remove it be the right thing to do at this stage then there be the issue of the carrot many of we have take part in debate in this place about slapp order which enable those with great deal of wealth at their disposal to abuse our legal system in order to shut down independent reporting that expose wrongdoing and shin light into the place that need it my hon friend underestimate his own role in this area which have be very strong suspect that like he wish that we be see section commence rather than repeal today as be sure do the mccanns the dowlers christopher jefferies and all the other historical victim of press abuse give that we be go for the carrot rather than the stick the carrot be well than nothing can my hon friend explain why there be not universal support for that across the house will leave it to other to explain why they be adopt their position but do take issue with some of the assertion that have be make by some government members who say that the current system be an improvement on what we have before as point out early the ipso system receive over complaint in but only of they or be uphold less than challenge anyone to say that it be satisfactory situation to have so few complaint uphold meet mother mandy garner for the first time yesterday her daughter be kill in hit and run in the hour after mandy be give the news and try to relay it to her family the daily mail go down to the scene of the crime and manage to purchase cctv footage from nearby shop that show the accident take place the daily mail do not actually show the moment of impact in the medium but within that hour it post that recording for people to watch under clickbait headline that happen in year after hack off start its campaign mandy describe her experience in an article the daily mail publish the cctv footage of my daughter last moment the morning after her death with lurid clickbait headline just as we be try to explain to our other child what have happen complain that it be an intrusion into grief and therefore in breach of ipso code on this think it be an open and closed case clearly it be breach if it be what actually would constitute breach month of to ing and fro ing with the daily mail follow while mandy be mourn her daughter she go on eventually ipso rule that it be not breach of their code one of the reason give be that you could make out my daughter face because the footage be grainy there be nothing about how the footage would impact on the people who know what have happen and know who be involve or about the family concern that the brother and sister of the young woman who have die would see the footage if that be satisfactory complaint system fail to understand what people think we be seek to achieve when we go through all of leveson and support set up the royal commission these issue continue to occur the calcutt report describe the press complaints commission which ipso be set up to replace as have be set up by the industry finance by the industry dominate by the industry and operate code of practice devise by the industry and which be over favourable to the industry if that description of the press complaints commission be not what we see now do know what be for people to assert that we be in well place under ipso be completely false and wrong far to that the government want to repeal section in its entirety but high profile case be come down the road that will attract great deal of public attention and they will focus attention back on this area of press complaint and have an independent complaint system they will call into question the decision of this house to repeal section feel that the government be in the wrong place on this issue which be why support amendment table by the right hon member for camborne and redruth george eustice we can not close the door on this matter the debate on it be not finish yet there be much more to come and it would be wrong of this house to shut the door on an independent press complaint commission in the way that repeal of section do rise to speak to amendment table by my right hon friend and fellow cornishman the member for camborne and redruth george eustice it would simply put requirement on ofcom to ensure that due regard be pay to the council of europe framework convention for the protection of national minority when assess the fulfilment of the public service remit this be of particular interest to we cornish because it be almost year since the council of europe formally recognise the cornish as national minority and the government accept that recognition this be historic moment for those of we from the west of the tamar because although the cornish have historically be recognise by this place as distinct from the english this be the first time for very long time that the government have also recognise that the government say that the cornish would be give the same recognition and status as the other celtic nation of the uk the scots the welsh and the irish over the last year we have be grapple with what that mean in application it be disappointing to say that at time the government have be criticise by the council of europe for not do enough to deliver on this new recognition and status the bill give the government straightforward opportunity to do something fairly simple yet tangible that would give meaning to the recognition of cornish national minority status it be clear that cornwall have history heritage and culture that be distinct from england and distinct within the uk it be unique in many way and we have far more in common with our celtic cousin around the fringe of the uk we have our own language and it have see revival over the last or year with many school now promote the cornish language and holding workshop unesco have upgrade cornish from extinct to critically endanger it be important that we recognise and seek to continue this progress be grateful to my hon friend for support amendment he make powerful case for why cornwall be unique and different do he agree that if the bbc have due regard for the framework convention on national minority it would take very different approach to local radio at the moment the bbc treat cornwall like any other part of england my right hon friend make very good point that be go to make there be clearly role for the bbc in help to protect promote and inform about cornish culture and the cornish language measure in this bill could be strengthen to ensure that the bbc play that role thereby help the government to fulfil their responsibility to give due recognition to the cornish we have see revival and fresh interest in cornish culture and history in recent year some of which be down to the hugely successful poldark series which for many have bring to life the history of cornwall and its role in the industrial revolution other programme have also help to put the spotlight on our unique cornish culture think particularly of the fisherman apprentice in which monty halls go to live in one of our very small fishing community to highlight both the historical and modern day struggle of such place we be look for programme that present picture of the true cornwall and our history heritage and culture not programme that present the idealistic picture postcard view of cornwall and that be just advert for more second homeowner we have rich deep and strong heritage and culture in cornwall which be what we want to present and protect in this day of increase multiculturalism do not want to go down that rabbit hole and with all that be happen in the world it be important that we do everything we can to protect the uniqueness of our cornish culture it be clear that broadcast medium can play an important role in help we to do just that and in help the government to give real meaning and value to the recognition of cornish national minority status in the uk be not call for our own cornish station just as scotland and wales have particular station be not go that far but more could be do to set an expectation that the bbc will give due regard to cornish protect national minority status in its public service broadcasting responsibility that be simply what amendment would do understand that my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth do not intend to press it to division but ask the minister to give careful consideration to the point that we have make and to the purpose of the amendment and to look carefully at whether the government can adopt the measure or something similar as clear sign of the importance that they place on protect and promote our cornish culture and heritage agree with all of that except be not quite sure how four country can be describe as fringe rather would call we the anchor hold the anglo saxon peninsula otherwise know as england in place during the lengthy passage of the bill we on the snp benches have engage with the uk government in good faith we all want healthy function responsible and free medium my hon friend the member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman cover many aspect of the bill in detail and it be unnecessary for to repeat anything that she say so will concentrate on the aspect of language historically the conservatives have express great support for the gaelic language indeed at my suggestion the house of commons select committee on culture media and sport on which sit have launch an inquiry on the future of gaelic and other minority language in these island therefore one piece of uk government recalcitrance have be strike why have the uk government be so resistant to make statutory mention of the gaelic language and of gaelic service we all agree cross party that this beautiful ancient and vibrant language make vital contribution to our cultural life and we know that its vastly positive impact dwarf the miserly public expenditure on it come from long line of gaelic speaker neither of my grandmother have english as their first language my mither mither be from scotstoun and speak scot and my faither mither come from the island of harris and speak gaelic be the first generation not to speak the language at all that be all too common story in scotland where prejudice against and punishment of gaelic speaker have see the language retreat to the heartland gaelic broadcasting have be vital in slow the language decline by introduce it to new generation of young scot nurture more enlightened attitude towards gaelic across scotland and the united kingdom gaelic programme producer have offer their expertise they volunteer to engage with member during the drafting of the bill and amendment to it in particular mention john morrison and donald campbell of mg alba it be therefore disappointing that the uk government have not draw sufficiently on that expertise and heed the call to reaffirm explicitly their commitment to gaelic in the digital age mg alba in its write evidence say that the bill will create visible disparity in the treatment by parliament of gaelic and welsh broadcasting mean that the gaelic language will continue to be invisible in statute and as result continue to suffer from unclear status and uncertain funding wish to record the disappointment feel among gaelic broadcaster and the wide gaelic speak community do the hon member agree that one of the good way for language lover to cherish and build up language minority language in particular be to avoid what sometimes happen which be the great politicisation of minority language that become divisive and people react badly do agree see no reason why language should be party political they be share cultural asset when look online be astonish to see people who do not share my constitutional position sometimes attack scot or gaelic as if it belong to we and not they the language belong to all of we as do the other national minority language hope that we will highlight some of the important shortfall and opportunity when join my friend the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage and cross party colleague in take evidence from expert witness during our minority language inquiry be in hospital recover from injury and surgery during some of the bill passage extend my gratitude to my hon friend the member for aberdeen north who work so assiduously on the measure in my absence and who consistently do so much good work in the house as be she will not she spend long hour in committee tirelessly scrutinise the bill line by line note that not single scottish national party or other opposition amendment be accept by the uk government yet another bizarre example of westminster method we turn up work hard research diligently engage with stakeholder contribute to debate and then we be largely ignore the government be force through their curious insistence on channel produce its own content that be fig leaf to justify the inordinate waste of time and money on yet another aborted attempt to privatise the channel as we all know channel which be surely well place to determine its need do not want that power what be it mr deputy speaker that conservative cabinet minister once say about policy making we have have enough of expert thank member for their contribution to today debate and indeed during prelegislative scrutiny and the bill passage thus far the bill have fantastic support have work on it since and be pleased to be back in post take over from the interim minister whom prefer to call the eminent knowledgeable knight and former secretary of state my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale but as my right hon friend the member for ashford damian green say we be all temporary in this place be glad to take the bill through its final stage and thank my right hon friend the member for maldon for his work and his defence of our position on section of the crime and courts act he be in the curious position of amend bill for which he be once minister as my right hon friend the member for ashford say our right hon friend the member for maldon be break new parliamentary boundary as we all know internet access and streaming service have fundamentally change how audience access broadcast content but our public service broadcaster and radio service be govern by law write or more year ago the bill be vital to enable our psb to continue to be world lead in their content and to serve uk audience while also drive growth in the creative industry across the uk shall briefly address some of the issue that have be raise but will first deal with the government amendment they be minor and technical and seek to ensure that the exist policy position be properly operational have write to member with more detail be glad to have the support of my right hon friend the member for ashford particularly for the radio amendment be grateful to my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice for his sustained interest he be passionate campaigner and have be push on section for many year the government recognise the intent of his amendment but their effect would not be to repeal section but to delay its repeal while consultation take place we feel that that would be at odd with our double manifesto commitment to repeal section in full notwithstanding my right hon friend view that the manifesto be not the good that we have produce and that there may have be some draft error in the publication understand that new clause would delay the commencement of clause but that be not the case with amendment which would simply remove one part of section of the crime and courts act we have concern about my right hon friend amendment as package one issue be about delay but another be about some of the small publisher that do not wish to be part of regulator that have be debate at some length this afternoon be glad that my right hon friend the member for maldon be pleased about the government amendment on am we discuss the matter together note his point about local television he kindly accept the unlikelihood of our accept his amendment but we will continue to consider his representation as always be glad of the support of the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone he suggest that the proposal to privatise channel be part of vendetta but it be bear of fundamental concern for its sustainability we have put forward measure in the bill to give channel great freedom we want the channel to survive and to have the flexibility to continue do what it do to the point raise in relation to those new power it will be grant the freedom to produce its own content but it do not have to use they if it do not feel that be necessary on public service content be prominently and easily accessible as be already the case in the linear space we want psb content to be as prominent as possible but there be question in relation to appropriate language as have be discuss at length the core aim be to secure prominence for psb service and content online but for it to be flexible operable and proportionate so that we can design the bill for innovation and consumer choice we be give ofcom the power to establish that balance the father of the house my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley along with my right hon friend the member for ashford and other raise the issue of digital right we recognise the intent behind the amendment to bring digital right within the scope of the list event regime the select committee ably chair by my hon friend the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage make recommendation that would support that outcome while there be great deal of support in parliament for that and be sympathetic it be complex issue we have see how technical just the government amendment to close the streamer loophole be add digital right would be much big change bring more complexity it be important that we maintain the right balance between access for audience and the commercial freedom that allow right holder to reinvest in their sport at all level we want to get the balance right and our priority be the impact on the public it be important that audience can watch and celebrate major sporting moment but broadcasting right provide sport national governing body with essential income enable they to invest in their sport whether at elite or grassroots level we want to fully evaluate the issue include how it could be well deliver before consider legislation that enact any particular conclusion assure members the issue be under careful consideration and we have not yet make decision the house will have listen with interest to the minister response to the point make by member from across the chamber but the government have get to try to sort this out while the bill be before parliament we want to hear from she that the government be capable of come to the lords with an amendment or new clause that do not get rid of the interest for the commercial bidder but say that when digital and reproduction right come up for sale the interest of people in our country our team and the sport that we regard as important whether they be new or old established one be take into account the house will not be satisfied unless the government come forward with proposal about what they can either agree with the right holder or the potential right bidder the house of lords will be right to insist on something that address that issue and we want to support they appreciate that my hon friend want to put down marker on the issue have hear that and so have the secretary of state maintain that the issue of right be more complex than one might imagine we want to get the balance right and we will continue to look at that move to the amendment on the issue of age rating we be in complete agreement on the need to protect child and vulnerable audience from harmful and inappropriate video on demand content have two child have push for child to remain in the remit and for there to be protection for they the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman talk about the importance of public service broadcaster and access to they fundamental drive force of the bill be that we want child to be able to continue to access public service broadcaster for the first time we be bring mainstream tv like on demand service in the scope of new video on demand code to be draft and enforce by ofcom welcome the general support for the bill give by my hon friend the members for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates and for south west devon sir gary streeter ofcom will be get new power under the bill to look at broad protection measure and to mandate specific approach in the code if deem necessary which could be bbfc age rating we be try to move to more outcome base approach rather than prescriptive approach we think that there have be great innovation in the space of parental control which have often be more effective than badge rating however have hear what have be say in the house today and we will continue to listen on this subject the hon member for aberdeen north also raise the issue of protection for viewer watch on device such as playstations simply wish to reassure she that the definition of on demand programme service be not platform specific disney and netflix view on game console would be cover she also raise question about the size of producer of content small producer be not keen on some of the proposal that she have make as they be concerned that they might one day be large producer and therefore be penalise we would not want to disincentivise their growth let move on to scottish broadcasting in general we believe that the bill will bring significant benefit to the scottish broadcasting sector and creative economy do not underestimate the vital role that our public service broadcaster play in support that scottish screen sector the bill contain provision to encourage our psb to broadcast programme in indigenous regional and minority language such as gaelic by include they in our new psb remit for television know that this be extremely important to numerous scottish members in this house and hope the government effort here be recognise the partnership between mg alba and the bbc be particularly significant for gaelic language broadcasting can assure members that the ongoing provision of gaelic will be key consideration as the secretary of state and progress the bbc funding review and the forthcoming bbc charter review of course scottish audience will also continue to benefit from the prominence provision in the bill the government be also aware of members concern about be able to access tv via terrestrial mean and have speak to my hon friend the member for moray douglas ross about that directly the bill do not include provision on that but wish to reassure the house that the government remain committed to the future of dtt and to protect the million of household who continue to rely on it that be why we have legislate to secure its continuity until at least but let be clear that be not cliff edge for dtt we have allow the renewal of the current multiplex licence so that they last until the end of but that do not mean that dtt will not continue after that point even if the government simply sit on their hand ofcom would still be able to re advertise the multiplex licence and our public service broadcaster could continue distribute their linear channel over dtt furthermore specific primary legislation would be require to remove the multiplex licensing regime for example we be always keen to make sure that major sporting event be publicly available as widely as possible which be why we have the list event regime but this be balance act it be another issue where we be try to find course through sport right holder use income from the sale of right to the benefit of the wide sporting sector lot of sport do not want the list event regime to be open up know that the scottish national party like the idea of government list event fund but snp members do not acknowledge the distortive effect it would have on the value of right nor do they say who would pay for it suspect that the uk taxpayer would and once again snp promise would be pay for by everybody else these snp promise be to protect all govern body in the uk not simply scottish one just want to correct the record on that will the minister not admit that devolve sporting govern body be unfairly disadvantaged give the size of our tv network and therefore our free to air broadcaster be unable to bid win and secure the right by contrast the english football association for example have large tv market where we have see itv then channel and now itv again show the game bow to my ministerial colleague the sport minister on the intricacy of sport funding however on the list event regime it be for the scottish government not only to make recommendation to we if they want to expand that but to have the discussion with scottish sporting body as to whether that be actually something they want will finish by respond to my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay steve double be glad to say that culture and heritage be directly address in the update public service remit for television ofcom be therefore require to ensure that public service broadcaster collectively make available content reflect the cultural interest and tradition of the uk and different local area within the uk which would expect to include cornwall thank you again mr deputy speaker and all member present for their contribution to the debate be grateful for the scrutiny the bill have receive it have benefit greatly from the expertise of everybody in this chamber commend the bill to the house understand mr eustice that you wish to withdraw new clause beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause clause by leave withdraw new clause gaelic language service the secretary of state must within six month of the passage of this act review whether gaelic language service should be give public service broadcast remit thangam debbonaire bring up and read the first time question put that the clause be read second time diane abbott debbie

be thrill to bit and other still have question but they have all be willing to take time to talk to we we have look at wide range of measure that we know be necessary for broadcaster but section have be difficult for many people respect the fact that people have approach this with serious intent purpose and commitment we probably will not vote on third reading because we all agree that the bill be necessary as the bill go to the other place section will be remove and we will not stand in its way as my hon friend the member for barnsley east outline in committee and as reiterate now however we have miss an opportunity this evening for more nuanced version of that repeal and we be disappoint that amendment do not pass there be further discussion to be have about how we can protect the provision of trust public interest journalism in the modern age if we be in government after the next general election labour commit to work with the press recognition panel ipso impress and anyone else we need to work with to ensure the high standard of ethical journalism whether it be online disinformation undermine our democratic institution the decline of local press outlet or the rise of slapp all these issue have to be take seriously for now our aim must be to ensure the passage of this bill so that these important measure reach the statute book the film and tv industry remain crucial to our economy contribute more than billion in alone and support job across the country it be right that we update the law after year so as well as thank colleague thank the clerks in the public bill office who have work incredibly hard to ensure the bill receive proper scrutiny by assist we in draft amendment thank the public service broadcaster uk radio station tv and radio platform podcaster viewer representative group and all the other stakeholder and particularly thank the hacked off campaigner who have be willing to speak so generously and openly about their often painful experience it be pleasure to speak on third reading as the minister say it be quite fun and enjoyable to serve on the public bill committee although the whips office should not see that as hint that want to be on every future public bill committee the medium bill be an important piece of legislation and key theme throughout its passage have be the importance of prominence for our public service broadcaster the bbc itv channel and channel should declare that have work for three of they and be sure that channel will one day complete the set that be not hint that will be look for new job in year time perhaps much to the opposition chagrin be extremely pleased with the new regime to ensure appropriate prominence for public service broadcaster but want to say word about it be pleased to hear the minister say that there will be detailed consultation on the work with ofcom but it be important that parliament set out clearly to the regulator what we mean by prominence look forward to the government take robust stance to ensure that ofcom feel entitle and empower to adopt muscular approach it must be bold with the tv manufacturer in express the will of this place to ensure that the psb really be feature prominently we need look at only one recent example of television to prove the value of psb the drama that have make the headline in recent week the itv programme mr bates the post office it highlight an injustice to million of people who have not previously be aware of the horizon scandal despite the fact that it have be cover in many news medium and that the government be already work extremely hard to provide redress and recompense for postmaster well before the drama be air mr bates have have an immediate and important effect but the programme could only have be make by psb the nature of that story be such that yes it be of massive interest to the uk audience but its international appeal as television programme might be less evident itv recognise the significance of the scandal put serious money into it and take commercial risk that would likely not have be approve by non psb that speak to the value of the legislation before we the hon gentleman be right to highlight this issue but it be also right to highlight the role of the under secretary of state for business and trade the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake for month before that broadcast the minister work hard we need to recognise that his month contribution coincide with the itv programme and the two come together at the right time be grateful to the hon gentleman for make that point as say the government have be act well in advance of the drama but the programme make the public aware in way that the news have not be able to the government make serious effort he be right to draw attention to the incredible work of the current minister with responsibility for postal service to achieve recompense and redress but the tv drama make the public aware of the scandal and the need for redress channel have point out that public service content rely on easy access for viewer without the reform in the bill the significant risk be that proper public value content will be hard to find for audience that can not be tenable be delighted that the bill seek to overcome that it be imperative that ofcom ensure and assure prominence for our psb as the house expect do not want to detain the house any long but will just say that public service broadcasting be one of the thing that make this country special there be britishness about our broadcasting system and market that be unique the bill recognise and protect that and be delighted to support it want to say few thank yous but will first talk about the bill briefly we need media bill be glad that the government be do their good to strike balance between right and responsibility with the psb as say early it be important that the bill update the exist situation and improve thing for internet access service it include many welcome step forward still have the concern express early about the definition of on demand service appreciate what the minister say for example that be cover by it but if we look at tv viewing app on playstation the order of the app or of the programme be not cover by the definition because playstation be mostly for play game its on demand tv section be not cover think more can be do to future proof the definition and update it to ensure that it cover everything that the government want it to cover it should cover the way in which people generally watch television especially those method that increase as time go on do not want to be overly critical but want to flag that point again come to the thank yous thank my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands for his work and that of his team especially on list event he have be work on that campaign ever since have know he and be certain that the rejection of his new clause today will not result in he sit quietly he will continue to speak on behalf of scottish football fan although six nations rugby be also an important part of his speech we do not take oral evidence which be fairly unusual for bill committee that start off in the house of commons understand the minister reason for that decision which involve the pre legislative consultation that take place however several organisation be disappoint not to have the opportunity to give oral evidence directly to the committee thank all those organisation that come forward the shadow secretary of state mention quite few many organisation have work incredibly hard to ensure that members of parliament know their view particularly thank broadcast the media reform coalition bbc alba stv channel bbc amazon and hack off member of which meet on several occasion particularly about the amendment that we discuss today hope that we get close to what be promise to those who give evidence to the leveson inquiry and to resolution that mean great fairness for everybody unfortunately it feel as though the bill be not the place where that will happen it be clear from view across the house that change need to happen to ensure that people get the redress and justice that they hope for thank all those who have put time and effort into try to improve the bill thank all the staff who have work on the bill whether those on the government bill team or the clerks who have do their good with the messy amendment that send they and ask they to make into something that look vaguely sensible those staff be never mention enough thank all those who have have an input into the bill congratulate the minister and the department on get the bill this far if may be presumptuous in the unavoidable absence of the chair of the culture media and sport committee thank the minister for her kind remark about the select committee contribution to the scrutiny of the bill this be probably the appropriate time to note the bill historic nature it be year since the house pass an equivalent bill twenty year ago facebook tiktok snapchat and twitter or whatever we call it these day do not exist the entire landscape have change completely regulate with tool that be year out of date be impossible that be why it be important that the bill be future proof the thought occur to that if it take more year before the house come back to the subject by then we will doubtless get sound and vision beam straight into our ear and eyeball after press the chip that will have be implant in we regulate that will be even more difficult be ponder which minister will be here in year to cope with that and it will almost certainly be my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale who have do the job on and off for several decade already have every confidence that he will still be do it perfectly well in the when we next come back to the subject echo the remark of my hon friend the member for aylesbury rob butler about the importance of public service broadcasting which be one of the glory of this country that be something that we have get right over many year hope and expect that the bill will allow we to continue to get it right for many year to come wish the bill well for the rest of its passage may simply say that if the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale be here for the next bill hope that will be in the chair to see it question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass business without debate delegated legislation motion make and question put forthwith standing

etc fossil fuels lobbying motion make and question propose that this house do now largan to avert climate breakdown the vast majority of the fossil fuel industry coal gas and oil reserve need to stay firmly in the ground yet successive government lead by different political party have fail to take the kind of action that the science demand they have know the indisputable fact and the consequence of inaction such consequence include the fact that the cost of delaying and of fail to address climate economic and social chaos far outweigh those associate with an orderly transition along the line of job rich inequality bust green new deal yet government after government have continue with business as usual government after government have refuse to grasp that despite some breakthrough success and progress the big picture have continue to get bad do not deny that we be now see record amount of energy be generate from renewable resource for example but these very welcome achievement do nothing to eliminate the dangerous damage arise from the continue extraction and burning of fossil fuel give what the expert have be say for decade now we have to ask ourselves why this government and other before they have preside over and collude in the frankly criminal decision that have see yet more oil gas and coal continue to be explore and exploit the answer to that question can be trace back to one consistent factor the role of the fossil fuel industry in our politic for over those very same decade when climate scientist have be warn of the rapidly shrink window to avert climate emergency fossil fuel company and their lobbyist have be deny the science and then they have delay weaken and sabotage climate action those tactic have enable they to make billion in profit while heat the planet and destroy community in this debate want to highlight some of the way in which fossil fuel influence be exert in our politic and to propose how it should urgently be curtail want to start with case study feature the little know fossil fuel lobby group offshore energies uk oeuk whose member include north sea operator such as equinor harbour energy bp and shell and whose activity have result in windfall tax that actually reward company for dig up more oil and gas and price floor introduce entirely at the industry behest let explain how that have happen accord to analysis of datum in the public domain oeuk and its member meet uk government ministers more than time in the year follow russia invasion of ukraine that be nearly once every work day in june in that one month when the energy oil and gas profit levy bill be draft and consult on the industry go into lobby overdrive oeuk and its operator member have twice as many meeting with ministers as they do in the month before or after it also hold parliamentary reception in the name of the all party group on the british offshore oil and gas industry for which it provide conveniently the secretariat the main message for the mps and peer in attendance be that the windfall tax would undermine and disrupt investment in the sector in meeting few day later with the then chancellor now prime minister the industry spell out what it want to see in the bill its recommendation also put in writing to the treasury include protection for petroleum revenue tax repayment which be in essence an exist tax break that can pay fossil fuel firm back for taxis they have pay in the past the subsequent legislation do exactly as oeuk request moreover it introduce an enormous investment allowance which combine with exist tax break mean that fossil fuel company can claim back for every they invest in uk oil and gas extraction as result of that climate wreck loophole shell for example go on to pay no windfall tax at all in the lobbying around the bill be happen in the context of wide lobbying campaign by oeuk which have be urge the treasury all year to reinstate regular meeting of the so call fiscal forum an advisory group that basically invite oeuk and its member to shape their own tax regime on december they get their wish the fiscal forum meet again host by the new chancellor the right hon member for south west surrey jeremy hunt and the industry use the meeting to claim yet again that the windfall tax would harm investment in the sector that meeting occur in the wake of the chancellor already have announce further change to the windfall tax regime that would in effect see taxpayer actually pay and hand over money to oil and gas firm for investment be make none the less those company want still more and they use the fiscal forum to demand that price floor be introduce and surprise surprise they get it in spring oeuk board member of harbour energy and equinor meet with treasury official the minute secure via freedom of information request state that the equinor rep smile at government reassurance yes be sure they do the hon lady be eloquently set out how the government be respond to heavy lobbying from the fossil fuel industry do she agree that no future generation neither our child nor our grandchild will ever thank we the politician of today for have put all our energy and focus into the energy of the past do she agree that the fossil fuel industry should really look at itself as well it will come as no surprise to the hon member that completely agree with she do wonder what our own kid will think when the planet continue to heat still far and what their kid in turn will think what be we think of what be the fossil fuel industry thinking of certainly beyond its profit apparently very little commend the hon lady for bring forward this debate she have be assiduous in her commitment to these issue indeed would go as far as to say the hon lady have on many occasion be the conscience of this house on these issue do she agree that it be essential that vote cast and action take in this place be influence by fact and reason opinion and never by one individual or group while there be place for lobbying let we be honest it be through lobby that we learn more understand that it should be only part of the consideration of any issue thank the hon member for both his comment with which agree and his kind remark he be right of course lobbying happen but line get cross when money start to change hand there be perception never mind what the reality be of member and group potentially pursue interest that be to their own advantage rather than for the public good in june after sustained further lobbying meeting letter and statement in the press the government introduce the price floor that oeuk have so assiduously lobby for surprise surprise to summarise privileged access and meeting with ministers an opaque official look lobbying group and an oil and gas fiscal forum advise the treasury collectively result in significant change to government plan which in turn result in windfall tax that raise just half of what the government have promise and save corporation billion all of course at time of record fossil fuel company profit and cost of live crisis for consumer that be what happen when we let fossil fuel into every corner of our politic that be only the tip of the iceberg last year it be report that gulf state push fossil fuel at have hire the now lord hammond and lord maude along with former prime minister tony blair and other former lead politician as consultant as we know it be incredibly easy for senior british politician and civil servant to swap government office for consultancy retainer they simply have to register with the advisory committee on business appointments body which even its chair the former conservative mp and now lord pickles admit be toothless if they take up any new pay or unpaid work within two year of leave office for example acoba response to lord hammond work for mohammed bin salman regime be to note that his inside knowledge of the uk government could be perceive to offer an unfair advantage and then it go ahead and approve it all the same when in lord hammond advisory work be deem by acoba to have breach the rule the only sanction be strongly word letter know and accept the convention not to criticise the conduct of individual mp or peer so simply want to set out fact that be already in the public domain and on the public record it be not just former ministers go through the revolve door between parliamentarian and the fossil fuel industry to take up lucrative consultancy role second job placement internship and sabbatical be all different side of the same coin and all too often lot of coin be make or exchange member of this house can benefit financially from the fossil fuel sector in other way too as the right hon member for chipping barnet theresa villiers presumably do when she hold worth of share in shell for five year when she be environment secretary as publish in the register of members financial interests in august have do the courtesy of alert any member to whom be refer in this chamber by email they to let they know the right hon member for stratford on avon nadhim zahawi also do in the shape of payment from oil company client to business advisory service zahawi zahawi piece together in research carry out by journalist jonathan watts and pamela duncan for the guardian from his shareholding in an oil and gas exploration and production company and the million worth of donation he receive from fossil fuel company include regular monthly payment of that stop only when he become minister the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes who be in this place and with whom have have conversation to inform he that be about to reference some of his interest have be member of this place since he serve as the energy minister under the now foreign secretary and hold down second job for bb energy which trade more than million metric tonne of oil every year as strategic adviser he be pay per year for the equivalent of around day work accord to his own register of members financial interests three of the big donor to the conservative party be funder or board member of the climate science sceptic think tank the global warming policy foundation or its spin off net zero watch company from cardiff airport to exxonmobil be hand out football ticket and pass for hospitality event to mps across the political spectrum in fact think can safely say that there be probably only one uk wide political party represent in parliament that have not have some kind of handout from the fossil fuel industry whether donation expense pay trip salary or gift at this point give credit to the hon member for coventry south zarah sultana for go public about the food hamper send to she by staff at heathrow in the hope it would secure her support for their third runway they obviously do not know she very well financial benefit can not be divorce from conflict of interest or perceive conflict it be worth note that there be no requirement on members of this house to declare any income from dividend or any income gain from the sale of share give the seemingly routine way in which share get move into blind trust when mp become ministers as use by the current prime minister and chancellor or the threshold at which we be suppose to publicly declare shareholding stake the idea that we have transparency around conflict of interest be laughable the evidence suggest that member of the other place be just as at risk of the perception at least that they be influence by dirty fossil fuel money total of peer have significant stake in the industry accord to datum there the declaration threshold be low at it be low again at the senedd and holyrood but they be certainly not immune to fossil fuel influence low threshold would clearly be an improvement but we need to do more than just tinker with the exist rule in the vast majority of these instance nobody be do anything that break the parliamentary rule the transparency of lobbying non party campaigning and trade union administration act only restrict about of lobbyist mostly trade union represent worker and charity meanwhile corporation can pretty much do what they like and consistently they do when we realise as analysis by the guardian clearly show that there be direct link between fossil fuel money and the position that mps take in parliament it be self evident that the rule can not be fit for purpose believe that be an mp be about serve the public interest not the interest of fossil fuel company in case anyone want to suggest that they be work in the public interest let remind the house of the economic impact of continue to extract and burn fossil fuel public debt could rise to of gdp by the end of the century if climate change be leave unchecked accord to the office for budget responsibility the climate impact be well know if we want to be in with even chance of stay within the all important limit we can not open new field and we should be phase out exist fossil fuel infrastructure in way that will secure just transition that be not what these company be use their influence to make happen and they be frighteningly effective climate action tracker cite the government double down on north sea oil and gas extraction as key factor in the uk insufficient rating on compatibility with the paris agreement and these company dirty fingerprint can be see all over our politic and it be time to clean thing up what do that look like first there would be firewall between the industry and decision making no lobbying meeting if meeting be happen for example about the good way to secure the green transition there must be full transparency deliver in something approach real time not month after the event at present the government publish detail of some meeting every three month or so often it be every six month but they be incomplete at well have to ask series of formal parliamentary question to expose lunch that the then secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy the right hon member for spelthorne kwasi kwarteng have with saudi oil company aramco it be miss from his official declaration first be tell that that be because it be social occasion and then that there have be an administrative oversight all that happen month after the event an event that frankly should never have happen in the first place it go without say that the behind close door cosy dinner drink event and so forth have to be drag into the sunlight there be no convenient line between social event and political business for ministers or ministers in waiting if they have conversation about policy either off or on the record with someone from the oil and gas sector or indeed another sector that stand to benefit they should be require to make that public pretty much immediately proper firewall mean no industry representation on panel government research body or expert or advisory body no fossil fuel involvement in climate negotiation no place on government delegation to international negotiation or trade mission no staff exchange between the industry and government departments far great period between leave ministerial role and parliament and consult for an oil and gas firm for example with complete ban on any sit parliamentarian do that kind of work pay or otherwise no implicit endorsement from politician as result of their speak alongside industry representative or at event with which the industry have any kind of association and certainly no fossil fuel company sponsorship of political party conference last year chevron co host an event at conservative party conference with the tagline can fossil fuel company play role in the energy transition we know that the only role that they want to play be one of delay and obfuscation so why should they be able to pay to get privileged access to ministers and potential ministers the hon lady will be surprised to learn that agree with some of what she have say it would certainly be wrong of such company to lobby ministers on any interest that they have she will know that my view on these matter long predate any such interest and for the record never lobby any minister on any matter connect with the interest that she have describe thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention and understand of course why he would want to make it would simply say that there be concern around perceive influence as well as direct influence have no reason to doubt for second what he have just say be sure that it be absolutely true but at the same time when people outside this place look at the fact that have be lay out this evening in dispassionate way hope alarm bell will start to ring at the very least we be talk about an industry that have massive impact on the future of our planet and think it right give the access that it appear to have to people in high place to have this debate and raise those question in this place do the hon lady agree that although we all roughly agree that we need to get to net zero the big problem be the pace of change the fossil fuel industry have successfully lobby we all to say not so fast you can do it so fast do pull the rug from under our foot that be the big danger we face because if we miss the target there be no point talk about net zero we have target and we need to reach it urgently we can not delay any far or go at slow pace than necessary thank the hon member for her intervention which remind of powerful thing that the us campaigner bill mckibben say delaying be the new denial and win slowly be the same as lose there be real imperative here to be fast congratulate the hon lady on secure this adjournment debate and on the strength of her argument echo the point make by the hon member for strangford jim shannon about her contribution to this house over the year it have be pleasure to serve with she over the last decade and more would the hon lady add to her list the need to reduce the overall cost of politic an article read recently estimate that spending in the forthcoming general election will dwarf anything that have happen before the expenditure on social medium alone will be great than for the last official campaign period political party go look as they be at the moment for vast amount of money to spend on electioneering but it come at cost because the funder who give they that money then want something in return be very grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention and his kind comment it be always great pleasure to work with he and agree entirely when it come to spending on election we seem to have an arm race that be out of control which of course drive the obsession with get more money to line the war chest that enable party to fight those election cap on that funding be urgently require which bring to the next point want to make to take the point that my hon friend the member for carmarthen east and dinefwr jonathan edwards make about election bit far do the hon lady have any confidence that thing might change follow the next election give that the labour party have say that it will stand by any licence grant between now and then thank the hon gentleman for his intervention it be incredibly disappointing that labour have in sense not follow its own logic it be happy to say that it will not accept any new licence but if labour be to make the clear statement right now that once it get into power if it do it would revoke those licence that could have chilling effect on all the licence that be go ahead they be go ahead at huge rate and the government want to see they go ahead even fast when an official opposition have it in its power to stop that process and choose not to disappointing be too polite term frankly be come to the issue of dirty money in politic want to see an end to it because it come with string attach that be tie up in knot our chance of liveable future there can be no conceivable justification for allow the fossil fuel lobby to directly or indirectly buy favour from politician so there should be no donating to mps or to political party and no donation in kind whether that be to all party group or via football ticket event sponsorship or trip overseas at the same time the rule on conflict of interest need redesign to shut out vested fossil fuel interest not simply have they declare on the record it be time to close the revolving door no side job or cosy secondment no blind trust put thing in the name of one spouse or rake in money from share or second job and of course much tough sanction for breach of the rule include suspension for example thirdly and lastly the preferential treatment mete out to the fossil fuel industry must come to an end most immediately the handing over of public subsidy and other incentive for fossil fuel must end most notably that come in the form of favourable tax regime which in the past have result in oil company pay less than in tax per barrel of oil pump from the north sea compare with the per barrel that company pay if they be operate in norway the hon lady be make some excellent point do she agree that it be quite frustrating to look at the regime in norway which collect more tax mean that the people of norway have fund for the future while we will not have anything at all by way of legacy benefit from the oil and gas industry only an unliveable planet if thing continue as they be thank the hon lady very much for her eloquent intervention she be exactly right she underline the point that stop these vast subsidy for the fossil fuel industry be not only the moral thing to do or in the interest of the climate it be in the economic interest of the future of this country the wealth fund in norway be very good model that we could and should have follow what have describe be one of the countless way in which our politic be side with and enable the fossil fuel sector as well as the bank lawyer lobbyist consultancy think tank and many other that feed off it those company should have no place in our politic if they do it be undemocratic and deeply dangerous for climate action give that their priority be put forward policy that actively and significantly undermine the uk climate commitment instead we should seek to change politic into force that side with the economic writing on the wall and the only chance we have of liveable future transition to climate safe future with the public we be elect to serve will bring my remark to an end with three question for the minister first can he tell who in government have overall responsibility for monitor the influence that fossil fuel company have as result of their political lobbying secondly can he confirm whether the government be satisfied that the check and balance in place be sufficient to ensure that parliamentarian be not influence by fossil fuel lobbying thirdly do he agree that this go to the very heart of how government and parliament be run and therefore warrant the establishment of for example new dedicated select committee to properly and regularly scrutinise the influence of the fossil fuel industry and indeed other corporate influence on political decision making as well as to make recommendation for change we be talk about not just the impact on climate but the standing of parliament in this country think many people look at this place and draw conclusion that be not particularly favourable it look as if we be out for ourselves we need to clean up politic both because it be the right thing to do and because it might be just one step towards begin to rebuild our reputation with the british public congratulate the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas on gain this adjournment debate and echo in part what the hon member for strangford jim shannon say although we do not agree on everything we appreciate that she be to some extent the conscience of the house on these matter and be always there to encourage government and everyone else to go far be pleased to be able to respond to some of the point that the hon lady raise she make the case that the interaction between representative of fossil fuel company political figure and those in public life should be transparent the government believe that lobbying be legitimate part of political development in all area as long as it be conduct transparently and ethically to maintain the high standard in public life the government outline wide range improvement to transparency around lobby in their strengthen ethics and integrity in central government policy statement of july these include revise guidance to widen the range of lobbying engagement declare by departments and link reform to the consultant lobbying framework these measure when implement will ensure that all lobbying activity irrespective of which sector be be represent will be conduct openly and in accordance with the principle expect of participant in public life in the uk number of system ensure that lobbying activity be conduct honestly and transparently take together these system which set the rule for the consultant lobbying industry ministers and government departments members of parliament and political party ensure that it be clear whose interest be be represent in public life the register of consultant lobbyist create by the lobby act the transparency of lobbying non party campaigning and trade union administration act have significantly increase transparency around the work of consultant lobbyist since its creation in the register make it clear whose interest be be represent by consultant lobbyist and provide accessible online information about those undertaking consultant lobbying and their client as well as detail of investigation into allege breach of the act the act also establish an independent registrar of consultant lobbyist who have power to monitor and enforce compliance and administer the register of consultant lobbyist the register of consultant lobbyist complement exist transparency mechanism include the quarterly publication of ministerial meeting with external organisation business appointment rule and industry lead regulation such as subscription to industry code of conduct from january onwards meeting hold between ministers and consultant lobbyist will be declare through routine quarterly transparency this will also apply to those senior official who be subject to meeting declaration new transparency guidance be publish on in december detail strict minimum standard for meet description to ensure that declaration contain relevant constructive information as say new guidance expand the scope of transparency declaration for senior official to include meeting hold between external organisation and individual and director general finance and commercial director and senior responsible owner in the government major project portfolio the code of conduct for member of parliament set out the standard of behaviour expect of ministers and the rule on the registration and declaration of interest the code provide that member must fulfil conscientiously the requirement of the house in respect of the registration of interest in the register of members financial interests and must always be open and frank in declare any relevant interest in any proceeding in the house or its committees it be for the standards committee not the government to consider any change to the approach to the registration of interest the minister be obviously go through the exist architecture that be suppose to guard against undue influence from lobbyist corporation and so on wonder whether he would agree with his presumably former colleague now lord pickles who admit that the office of the advisory committee on business appointments be toothless and that work do need to be do on that if when member breach the rule they simply get letter tell they you should not do that again that will hardly be sanction that anyone will be particularly worried about obviously the government take seriously anything that lord pickles say and certainly do he be my predecessor in brentwood and ongar and hold he in high regard there be process by which such comment be consider and we will continue to go through it hope the hon lady will appreciate that chunk of the framework that have just set out be new and it be important that we give it chance to work what govern lot of our thinking perhaps where we diverge from she be the fact that we can not envisage situation in which it would be wise to shut energy company out of the discussion we consider they to be fundamental to the transition to net zero we also believe that some may have role when we get to net zero and that it be clear that some fossil fuel will be necessary even when we reach that destination consequentially the secretary of state for energy security and net zero and her minister regularly meet wide range of stakeholder to discuss issue relate to energy security and net zero of course that include meet oil and gas company and representative organisation as well as environmental organisation and charity for sector that support around job and be at the forefront of the drive to net zero and the energy transition where the workforce be transferable to green job of the future that be responsible position to take the prime minister have reiterate that net zero be priority for this government and we remain absolutely committed to meet our legally bind net zero target more than ever we be determined to adopt fair and pragmatic approach to net zero that minimise the burden on work people no other country have match our record on decarbonisation unlike most other country the uk climate commitment be set in law the uk be net importer of oil and gas and fast decline producer hence new oil and gas project simply reduce the fall in the uk supply they do not increase it on current level the new offshore petroleum licensing bill will not undermine those commitment the minister be be generous with his time he will know that just today the climate change committee issue an interim report say that the government be off target when it come to their commitment and the threshold they be mean to meet he will also know that the same committee have be pretty critical of for example the new offshore petroleum licensing bill he can not simply rest on his laurel and say that we have good reputation in the past and therefore thing be go to go well now we be off track right now secondly the minister talk about consultant lobbyist but they be tiny proportion of who be do this work for example the foreign secretary be not register as consultant lobbyist when he work for greensill the consultant lobbying issue be frankly complete red herring here we need to look beyond that at who be speak to whom and with what effect alas have no laurel on which to rest be merely junior minister obviously the government be keen that we have fit for purpose regime that ensure that lobbying be transparent that be why we have introduce number of the change that have already outline on the report publish today by the committee the hon lady will have to forgive because have not yet have time to consult it but we always take the committee finding seriously she will also be aware that it have previously say that even when we get to net zero we will still require some fossil fuel for certain purpose think the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas have get point about acoba and so do lord pickles happily have never breach acoba rule or any parliamentary rule as she know but if anyone do so surely there ought to be some measure that acoba could take my hon friend the minister have be through the process as those of we who have be ministers all have and he will know that my own long establish view on these subject be unaltered unaffected and uninfluence by anything do outside this place but none the less the point remain it be hard to imagine my right hon friend break any rule have to say know the authority will have note what he say on acoba the hon member for brighton pavilion have clearly articulate her view on how the uk should aim to reach the goal of net zero that we might differ on that do not detract from the core principle that range of energy stakeholder all have role the government firm belief be that lobbying activity have an important and legitimate role to play in the policy development process so long as interaction between lobbyist and political actor be properly declare we support the exist rule which apply to the lobbying industry government and parliament both to individual member and to informal group and all party parliamentary group and we shall continue to drive forward reform to improve transparency the hon lady might disagree but in democratic society public policy be well inform by engagement and political debate elect representative have to meet wide range of people not just people they agree with that be democratic engagement such debate should be support by an independent free press and then at the ballot box we should trust the people question put and agree to house adjourn
